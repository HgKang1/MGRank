"['start with less distressing calls', 'role-play beforehand', 'get a lot of practice', 'fake it', 'fidget', 'enlist backup']",How to Get Rid of Phone Anxiety2," Do you find yourself feeling more confident during some phone calls and less confident during others? If so, it may help to build your confidence by starting with phone calls that don’t cause so much anxiety.For example, if you need to make three phone calls—to a friend, to a colleague, and to make a reservation—rank the level of anxiety you feel with each one. Then, start with the least anxiety-provoking, like to a friend. Make that call first to get some good vibes. Then, move to the next one and so on.  , Sometimes phone calls cause anxiety because of the context of the call. In these situations, it may help relieve anxiety to role-play with a friend or family member ahead of time. That way, this person can help you desensitize before the real call and give you feedback about your performance.For example, before a telephone job interview, you might do a “mock interview” with a friend. Have them ask you questions. Then, you can provide thoughtful answers as if it were the real deal. Ask for feedback after the “interview” is over so that you can make improvements.  , The more you force yourself to face a fear, the less power it has over you. Therefore, you can gradually reduce the anxiety you feel about making phone calls by making more of them. Instead of sending a text, call a friend, coworker or family member. If you are planning to email a professor or boss, skip the email and call.As you practice making more phone calls, you’ll likely find the activity doesn’t stress you out as much.  , There’s a classic confidence-building strategy known as “fake it ‘til you make it.” Try this when you’re making phone calls. For instance, even when you’re not feeling so confident, lift your chin, pull your shoulders back, and smile during the call. “Faking” confident body language may actually lead to real confidence., It can be helpful to release anxiety with small movements. When you’re planning to make phone calls, take something in your hand, such as a stress ball, a fidget spinner, or a handful of marbles. Play around with these items during the call to release excess tension., If you’re required to participate in a phone call that is stressing you out, see if you can get a buddy on the call. This person can be silently present on the line to offer you moral support during the call. Or, they can join in on the call to serve as a buffer when you forget what you were going to say or become tongue-tied.For example, if you’re checking in with a supervisor, you might plan to have a team member join you on the call. If you’re calling a distant relative, ask your mom or sibling to talk to them with you.  ",472,"['backup', 'lot', 'practice', 'distressing calls']"

Players then have 90 seconds to think of an item in the second category that shares common ground with the items listed.  Only one response per item.  , When the time expires, players add up the total number of letters in common for the three responses. The player with the highest total wins the round and advances five spaces.  In the event of a tie, the payers involved play an instant round where the next category cards in each pile are revealed simultaneously, and the first player to call out an item from each category that shares common ground, wins the tiebreaker, and advances five spaces. Instant rounds also take place whenever a player lands on the same space as another player, and the instant round involves only those 2 players.  , Next the players select an option card (No Action, Roll & Advance or Super Instant Round) and place it face down on the board. When all have done so, they flip them over simultaneously.  No Action - This means that the player wishes to not use an option card at this point. Roll & Advance - Player rolls the die and advances accordingly. These are played in order beginning with the player to the left of the player who started the round by listing items. Roll & Advance cards are played before any Super Instant Round. Super Instant Round means that the player is calling for an instant round involving all players and the winner advances four spaces in this case.

If you did just wash your hair, it can help to add a little dry shampoo. You can also add hairspray, if that's your preference. These products will help make it easier to style., Make sure you don't have any tangles or knots in your hair. Styling tangled hair can cause severe knots when you take down your hairdo. It's important to brush in the direction of the ponytail. That is, brush as if you are trying to sweep your hair into a ponytail, brushing towards the crown of your head. That means also flipping your head over to brush upwards toward the crown.        , Lift a small section of your hair about midway to the crown. Backcomb towards the roots gently with a teasing comb. This teasing helps round your hair and give it volume at the top.        , Hold the hair in place at the back of your crown with one hand. Smooth out with a brush or comb, but only do so lightly on the top of your head where you teased it.        , Pull the band around your ponytail onto the crown of your head. Twist the band into a figure 8 and pull the new loop back through your hair. Repeat this movement until the hair tie is tight enough that it stays put.         Do not use a rubber band, as that will tangle your hair. Always use a hair tie made for hair. You may need an extra thick one for a high ponytail.To look extra nice, take a small section of hair from the bottom of your ponytail and carefully wrap it around the elastic.

"['network to find opportunities in your field', 'take advantage of online job search engines and print resources', 'cold call organizations to ask about job openings', 'promote yourself']",How to Become a Mental Health Technician3," If you have been volunteering or shadowing, ask whether that organization has any available positions. Even if they don’t, they may be glad to put you in touch with friends, business partners, or colleagues with an opening who will be glad to have a personal referral.   In addition, let friends, family members, neighbors, fellow students, and pretty much everyone you meet know that you are looking for work as a mental health technician. Use online professional networking sites like LinkedIn to post your resume and see whether people you know may be able to point you toward your next job.  , Online job search engines, the newspaper, and even billboards at local mental health facilities can be excellent ways to find out what a wide variety of local companies have announced as job openings.   Consider multiple ways to phrase the type of mental health technician position you are hoping to get, and scan anything you are even remotely qualified for to decide whether to apply. Set up automatic searches and email notifications with keywords like “mental health tech,” “behavioral tech,” “psychiatric,” “counselor,” or any other terms that will locate new jobs in your field – most websites can send them to you daily or weekly according to your preferences.  , Psychiatric wards, rehabilitation centers, local and state public health agencies, community clinics, charitable organizations, private psychiatric offices, alternative therapy clinics, and hospitals may all have relevant mental health technician positions.   If you cannot find information about job openings on their website, consider calling and asking politely if they are hiring. You may wish to visit in person with a copy of your resume and a general cover letter explaining your wish to work as a mental health technician, describing your passion for the field and your most pertinent experience or education.  , Be vocal about your education, experience, and excitement for working as a mental health technician.   Find ways to describe past work experience as relevant mental health technician experience; for instance, customer service experience can translate to comfort working with a wide variety of people (good for working with patients), bartending can be billed as experience listening to people’s concerns and intimate problems, and being a college resident assistant can count as experience counseling homesick students and identifying alcohol abuse.

"['spot a sphere', 'learn the formula for the volume of a sphere', 'find the radius of the sphere', 'measure the sphere if the radius is not given', 'cube the radius to find r3', 'now multiply your answer by 4/3', 'multiply the result by π to find the volume of the sphere', 'express your answer in cubic units']",How to Calculate Volume6," A sphere is a perfectly round three-dimensional object, in which every point on the surface is an equal distance from the center. In other words, a sphere is a ball-shaped object., The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = 4/3πr3 (stated: ""four-thirds times pi r-cubed"") where r is the radius of the sphere, and π is the constant pi (3.14)., If the radius is given in the diagram, then finding r is simply a matter of locating it. If the diameter is given, you must divide this number by 2 to find the radius. For example, the radius of the sphere in the diagram is 3 inches.  , If you need to measure a spherical object (like a tennis ball) to find the radius, first find a piece of string large enough to wrap around the object. Then wrap the string around the object at its widest point and mark the points where the string overlaps itself. Then measure the string with a ruler to find the circumference. Divide that value by 2π, or 6.28, and that will give you the radius of the sphere.  For example, if you measure a ball and find its circumference is 18 inches, divide that number by 6.28 and you will find that the radius is 2.87in. Measuring a spherical object can be a little tricky, so you might want to take 3 different measurements, and then average them together (add the three measurements together, then divide by 3) to make sure you have the most accurate value possible. For example, if your three circumference measurements were 18 inches, 17.75 inches, and 18.2 inches, you would add those three values together (18 + 17.5 + 18.2 = 53.95) and divide that value by 3 (53.95/3 = 17.98). Use this average value in your volume calculations.  , Cubing a number simply means multiplying the number by itself 3 times, so r3 = r * r * r. In our example, r = 3, so r3 = 3 * 3 * 3, or 27.  , You can either use your calculator, or do the multiplication by hand and then simplify the fraction. In our example, multiplying 27 by 4/3 = 108/3, or 36.  , The last step in calculating the volume is simply to multiply the result so far by π. Rounding π to two digits is usually sufficient for most math problems (unless your teacher specified otherwise,) so multiply by 3.14 and you have your answer.   In our example, 36 * 3.14 = 113.09.  , In our example, the measurement of the radius of the sphere was in inches, so our answer is actually V = 113.09 cubic inches (113.09 in3).

Let patience and persistence be your allies.  , If your dog tends to bite your forearm, for instance, spray your shirt sleeve in that area while playing.   You can also search for homemade versions of this deterrent.  , Beating your dog is never the best way to handle any situation, and in the case of biting only tends to instill fear, aggression, and an invitation for rougher play, all of which promote more biting. Use the following negative association methods in combination with the “yelp and stop” methods.   Spray your dog in the mouth with a peppermint breath spray (like Binaca) when she bites. She will like neither the taste nor the sensation of the spray.Utilize a choke/pinch collar, if you are comfortable with doing so.Keep a leash on the dog while you play, and give a firm but not excessive tug when a biting or mouthing incident occurs. There are differences of opinion on whether choke collars are acceptable for use on dogs, so use your best judgement.  , All dogs are different, and training a puppy or older dog can be a frustrating and seemingly fruitless task. There is no shame in seeking out help from trained and experienced professionals.   The ASPCA recommends that you seek out a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB), a Veterinary Behaviorist (Dip ACVB), or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) with demonstrated experience in dealing with dogs who bite.Train your dog in your home as opposed to sending him away to a training school if possible. Training is most effective when done in the familiar environment in which the trained behavior will be most commonly expected., Even the best-trained dog who has never shown a proclivity for biting can unexpectedly bite you, a family member, or a guest. Pain, sometimes pain of which you may not be aware, can be one cause of unexpected biting behavior.   If there are behaviors, such as rough play or head-patting that can trigger a biting response from your dog, inform your family and guests to avoid doing so. Teach those around you to be aware of signs of an impending bite, by your dog or any others. These include ears pinned back, fur standing up, body stiffening, widened eyes with a direct gaze, and showing of teeth that can look like a yawn.Teach those around you how, in the worst case scenario, to respond to a threatening dog: remain calm, be assertive but avoid eye contact, and if attacked, ball up and protect your face, throat, chest, and fingers (by making fists).",447,"['method', 'clothes smell', 'professional assistance', 'puppy training methods', 'dog', 'taste', 'case', 'skin', 'taste deterrent.there', 'commercial sprays']"

This information may have been ""for your eyes only"". This is especially important if the original sender is your work supervisor. Be cautious about using BCC:. This can backfire if the person being BCC:'d replies back, not having seen that their copy was a blind one.  , Emails sent to you solely generally require that you reply only to the sender, but for emails sent to several people, you may need to choose the ""Reply to All"" option to send your response to everyone. Be judicious; using ""Reply All"" all the time creates returns in abundance and leaves messages languishing in the in-boxes of many people. Consider the consequences of receiving an email, hitting reply all and it goes out to twenty people and then those twenty people hit reply to all; it can compound very quickly into hundreds of thousands of emails and everyone feels compelled to hit ""reply all"" as a means of keeping everyone in the loop because nobody knows who is meant to read it and who is not.  , Some people don't want an email that says ""Thanks."" This takes additional time to open the email and read it just to read what you already know. Some people include a line that says “NTN” – “No Thanks Needed.”  , Scrolling through pages of replies to understand a discussion is annoying. Instead of continuing to forward a message string, take a minute to summarize it for your reader(s).  , Many people, and companies, write and respond to hundreds of emails every day. Avoid sending an indistinct email that says only 'Yes'. Include the question that the recipient asked so they know what you are responding to. Avoid making the recipient scroll down more than a single message in the history.  , If you need to do some research or some thinking before you respond to an email, or if you're too busy to write a full response promptly, send a short response letting the sender know that you got the email and advising when you will respond.  , When replying to an email, you can save everybody some time by anticipating any questions or concerns your reply may elicit.

Make them both the same size, and shaped like the earth—a flattened spheroid, just a little flat on the top and bottom. Spray them with the water bottle to make sure they are strong enough to hold the rest of the body up. Spray them, then wait about 30 seconds for the water to freeze.  , Make it an almost perfect sphere, but like the feet, make it flat on the ends. Spray it with the water bottle, then place it on top of the two feet. Put some snow to make sure it stays on the feet.  , Make it the same shape it would be if you joined the two feet, almost like a rectangle. This one is especially important to completely spray with water, as it is the most likely to fall apart. Place it on top of Olaf's body, making sure you can still see that it is two different balls.  , Spray it, almost drenching it. Do not place it on top of Olaf yet. Once it has frozen, spray it once again.  , This is where Olaf's eyes will go, as well as the carrot for his nose. Spray the fresh snow, and smooth off any rough edges. Then, make the top part of the right angle into a trapezoid. This is a major characteristic  that distinguishes Olaf from other snowmen, so spend a lot of time getting it perfect. Take a bit of snow off right where his mouth (and eventually teeth) will be.  , Form a small snowball, then cut it in half. Stick the semicircles to the top of Olaf's face, making sure they stay. Bring your rocks, and place them on top of those semi-circles. Use twigs to make the eyebrows. Put them high on his head with a pronounced arch, so he looks surprised.  , Using the twigs, stick three of them straight up on his head. Try to spread them out a bit so they look like his hair does in the movie.  , Rest it on the flat part of Olaf's face, sticking the very end right under his eyes.  , Put a chunk of snow right where his teeth will be, then carve away anything that will not be part of his teeth. Make the teeth very wide. Spray the area with water to ensure the teeth hold their shape.  , Because it is a strange shape, it may not balance at first. Put snow at the botton to keep it from falling off. Spray that area with water if desired.  , You can place them both down, or one up, or both up.

"['master isolations', 'learn how to ""pop"" with your abs', 'balance', 'hear the rhythm']",How to Dubstep Dance1," If you've ever taken a dance class, you're probably familiar with isolations. This is when you're moving a part of your body but nothing else -- hence isolating it. It may sound simple, but it's very difficult to move any part of your body without at least minimally affecting another. With the robotic like sounds of dubstep, it's essential.   Stand in front of the mirror. Start with your head and neck and move down your body, attempting to rotate each part of you independently. Go counterclockwise and clockwise with every part -- your shoulders, chest, abs, hips, down to your ankles. Work with the smallest bits -- finger, fingers, wrists, forearms -- once you get the hang of it. Nothing else should be moving.  When you get the hang of moving in circles, experiment moving up and down. You'll be moving on different planes while isolated for the majority of the time. For example, when moving your arm up and down, you're not using your wrist or elbow. Hold it strong, but move your arm leading with your shoulder; in fact, only your shoulder should be working.  ; , There are many helpful YouTube tutorials that take you through this process. Basically, you are moving your abs outwards and back in at a fast paced rate or to the beat of the music. With dubstep, that's pretty quickly.   Think of your body like a clam shell that's opening and closing. Your top and bottom halves should be coming in to meet at the middle. Practice this until you have it down, as it forms many of the basic moves to dubstep.  , You'll be doing a lot of work in slow motion. This means that the majority of the time your weight will not be evenly spread on both legs. And because of the smooth flow of the slow-mo parts and the choppiness of the glitchy parts, there is no wavering in dubstep.   There will be times when you're on your toes or the sides of your feet. Start practicing now! Yoga will help, too.  , Unlike something classic like the waltz (a simple 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3), dubstep goes very fast; often you'll be hitting 1/8 notes and the likes thereof. If you can't hear it, you can't dance to it.   Find a song you want to dance to and start drumming it. When you can hit all the filler notes (the small ones aside from the 1, 2, 3, 4) with your hands, you can start doing it with your body.  ",425,"['abs', 'master isolations', 'rhythm']"

If your cat’s teeth are yellow or brown, they have a buildup of tartar and plaque.Give your cat dental treats designed to reduce plaque and tartar.   Take your cat to the vet if you notice your cat has noticeably bad breath, or serious discoloration of gums and teeth. Vets can conduct an oral cleaning if necessary.  , There are many flavors of cat toothpaste available like chicken, liver, and malt. Choose one you think your cat will like. If your cat doesn’t like it, get a different one.  , Place a dab of toothpaste on your finger and let your cat lick it. Do this once a day for a few days to allow your cat to get used to the flavor and texture of the tooth paste.Do not put your finger in your cat’s mouth.  , You could use a baby human toothbrush, or obtain a specially designed cat toothbrush from your local pet store.Alternately, you could work the toothpaste into the cat’s mouth with a thin strip of gauze.  , For a few days before actually brushing your cat’s teeth, pull its lips back and just touch the brush to its teeth and gums. Reward your cat after doing so. Repeat for four or five days.  , Place a small dab of toothpaste on your strip of gauze or the end of your cat toothbrush and work it gently around your cat’s teeth in small circular motions. The teeth should have their entire surface brushed to a point just below the gum margin. Reward your cat after brushing with a yummy treat.   Do not brush directly on the gums. Check for loose teeth while brushing your cat’s teeth. If you detect any, contact your vet for an appointment.  , Vets are specially trained to look for problems with cat teeth that you might not see.   Some vets will brush your cat’s teeth as part of a regular checkup routine. If they do not, or if you don’t want to brush your cat’s teeth yourself, you can typically get the vet to clean its teeth for an added fee.  , The meat and marrow from the bones naturally polishes the surface of your cat’s teeth as it chews the bone.   Never give your cat cooked bones, which are likely to splinter. A cat that drags a raw meat bone around the house is likely to leave a greasy mess in its wake.

"['look for a food that offers “hairball control”', 'let your cat snack on cat grass', 'provide plenty of fresh water', 'use a hairball lubricant if hairballs persist']",How to Prevent Cat Hairballs2," Many premium cat food manufacturers make a ""hairball"" control diet. This is usually a dry kibble that contains fiber.The fiber attaches itself to the hair in the stomach and pulls the hair with it through the bowel to be passed. This is most effective when fed as the cat's main food.   These formulas also contain vitamins and nutrients to improve your cat’s coat, reducing the amount your cat will shed.Hairball control foods are not so useful for helping your cat pass an existing hairball. You may need to use a lubricant to help with the latter, and then continue with a hairball control diet to prevent recurrence.  , Cats love to snack on plants—often ones you wish they wouldn’t. Indoor cat grass is another good source of fiber for your cat, and it’s cheap and easy to take care of.Consider keeping some around for your cat to nibble at between meals.  , Water is highly important to your cat’s digestion, and cats can be very picky drinkers. If your cat prefers running water, then provide a circulating fountain-style dispenser or a deep, pool-style reservoir dish.These options come with attachable tanks that ensure your cat has continuous access to fresh water even while you’re away.  , You can find lubricants to help prevent hairballs in a couple of different forms. You apply some brands to your cat’s food while others you apply directly to your cat’s paw for her to lick off as she grooms. Regardless of the delivery method, the lubricant will coat the fur and help it pass more easily through your cat’s digestive tract.You can find several brands of hairball lubricant at your local pet store. Most will suggest giving them to your cat once or twice a week, but you should always follow the manufacturer’s directions.These formulations are most often petroleum based, which is safe for your cat at the suggested dosages.For existing hairballs, a lubricant can help your cat vomit up the hairball as well, so don’t panic if your cat produces a hairball after you’ve started using the product. After the existing hairball is up, the product should help prevent future ones. A small amount of vegetable oil on dry cat food can help as well, but it may not work as effectively as a petroleum-based lubricant. Check with your vet for the proper amount for your cat. If you are using a lubricant and your cat stops eating, seems unwell, or strains in her litter box, then seek veterinary attention for the cat.

Take a slow, deep breath in through your mouth. Try to feel it in your lower abdomen. Slowly release the breath through your nose. Take a few deep breaths whenever you feel road rage or anxiety and tension building when you are driving. Take as many breaths as you need to calm yourself and feel relaxed.; , You may find that your hands are clinched on the wheel, shoulders hunched, neck tight, and jaw tense. You can relax when driving if you do things that relieve the tension in your body.Shrug your shoulders up and down to relax them. Roll them forward and then backwards a few times. Relax your jaw and forehead. Smiling, even briefly, can help you relax your facial muscles. Turn your head slightly back and forth and left and right to release tension in your neck. Do some hand and finger stretches when you are stopped at a red light.  , Being mindful means focusing your attention in the here and now, on driving and only driving. Focusing your mind completely on driving doesn’t give your mind much room to think about anything upsetting and can help you relax when you are driving.Take notice of all your senses as you drive. What do you hear, see, or smell? What does the car feel like? Pay attention to how your body feels. You may say to yourself, “My shoulders feel tense and my stomach is queasy.” Take notice of your thoughts and emotions. For example, you might think, “I feel worried and nervous. I keep thinking about getting on the highway.” Allow yourself to experience your feelings without trying to stop them from happening. Notice as the feelings slowly go away and how you feel as they do.  , It is easy to start saying things to yourself that increase your feelings of tension, stress, anger, and anxiety. You can relax when you are driving if you make an effort to think relaxing thoughts and talk to yourself in a calm way.For example , when someone is driving unsafely, you may want to say to yourself, “They cut me off! This is so frustrating! Driving makes me tense!” Instead, think, “He’s not driving safe. I’m glad I don’t have to stay around him. I’ll move to this lane. He’s not interrupting my relaxing drive.” Or, you may think to yourself, “I’m not good at driving in this traffic. Something bad is going to happen.” Instead, try saying to yourself, “This is a chance for me to practice driving in traffic.

It is important that the paper is square since you are creating a box.; , Crease the fold with your finger then open the piece of paper.         , Use your finger to crease the fold, then open the paper again. You should now have two creases that intersect at the center of the square.        , Bring each corner to the center, so that the points are all touching. Crease the folds with your finger. Rotate the paper so it sits squarely in front of you, but don't unfold it this time.        , Crease the edges of both folds to secure them.         , Unfold the halfway folds and the triangles beneath those folds.

"['purchase a uv light pen', 'filter the water', 'turn on the light pen', 'submerge the pen and stir', 'dry the bottle threads before drinking']",How to Use UV to Sanitize Water1," Ultraviolet light pens for water sterilization can be found online or at your local outdoor store. There are a few different models to choose from depending on what you are looking for. Things to consider are the amount of water you need to sterilize and the weight of the device.   If you are using the UV light pen as your main sterilization while backpacking, make sure you have a secondary system (purification tablets or drops) in case the UV pen fails or runs out of battery power.; , Before using a UV light pen, you must ensure that your water is clear and free of particulate matter. This can easily be done by pouring the water through a piece of cloth such as a bandana. This will collect the dirt and result in clear water.This step does no sterilization other than removing dirt from the water. It still must be sterilized with the UV light. In an emergency, you can double the treatment time to sterilize cloudy water.  , Turning on the pen will depend on the specific model that you own, but it will likely be a button or switch. Different buttons will designate the amount of water you are purifying. There will be settings specific to half of a liter and one liter. It is not recommended to purify more than one liter of water at a time.Once the pen is on, you can place it in the water bottle.  , Submerge the lamp of the pen in the water and stir it around. The agitation of the water is important to ensure complete inactivation of any microorganisms present. If you do not see light coming from the lamp, the pen has not been properly activated is or is not working.Always carry a backup water purification system in case one fails. Keep the pen submerged until the light goes off. The pen has a timer based on the amount of water you are purifying and will shut off automatically.  , If you obtained the water from a stream, any microorganisms from that stream will still be in the water remaining on the threads of the bottle. The UV light pen will not sterilize these organisms, but if you simply dry the bottle off before drinking, you will be fine.Use a clean, dry cloth to dry off the bottle.

You'll feel more at ease wearing a helmet by knowing that if you make a mistake and fall, you'll be well protected.  , It will be easier to coast with this wheelie on a decline once you've figured out your balance. Since you won't be pedaling, the downhill slope will help keep the bike moving at a steady speed.  , Set the cranks level with each other at the 9 o’clock and 3 o’clock position, and stand up on the pedals with your knees slightly bent. Your weight should be just back of center. The cranks will rotate slightly as you move backwards, but otherwise you won't need to pedal., The front wheel should be lifted mostly by the shift of your weight backwards, and only slightly by lifting the handlebars. Lock your arms straight, keeping your feet level with each other on the pedals. Your rear end should be behind the seat at this point, and your body should have a “U” shape, with the arms and legs straightened., To be able to coast with the front wheel off the ground, you’ll need to find a point of balance over the rear wheel and hold it there. As your arms straighten and you lean back, push forward on the pedals with your feet (but don’t pedal) to adjust your balance. , Steady your balance and coast for as long as you need to. If you feel yourself falling too far backward, feather the rear brakes to bring the wheel down.If the front wheel begins to fall forward, rock your hips in a backward motion while pushing outward on the pedals. Most obstacles on the trail won’t be much higher than a few inches (tree branches, rocks). But in order for you to be able to coast with the front wheel off the ground, you need to fix your center of balance over the rear wheel, and this should bring up the front wheel at least one foot.  , Either feather the rear brakes or shift your center of gravity forward to bring the wheel softly down. If you're avoiding obstacles on the trail, make sure the path is clear before finishing the wheelie--bringing the wheel down directly onto a rock or branch could cause a fall.

"['flavor your vodka with skittles', 'snack on some vodka-infused gummy bears', 'make a starburst-infused vodka drink']",How to Drink Vodka3," Just like Starburst vodka, this candy cocktail is an alcoholic twist on a childhood favorite.   Separate individual Skittles by flavor. Unlike Starburst, this concoction is best enjoyed in discrete flavors. You will need 60 Skittles for each flavor you intend to make. Put the Skittles into an empty water bottle. Use a funnel to pour 6 ounces of vodka into the water bottle. Shake until the vodka takes on the Skittles color. Let the mixture sit a few hours to allow the candy to break down and blend into the vodka. Filter the mixture using an everyday coffee filter, then pour the refined mixture into a seal-able glass bottle. Let freeze for a few hours. Your Skittle vodka is now ready for consumption!, Though not a drink, these fruity, alcoholic treats are fun appetizers to go with your beverage.   Fill a Tupperware container with as many Gummy Bears as you want. Pour vodka into the container until it covers the top of the candy. Seal the Tupperware and keep in the refrigerator for at least three days before eating. Taste the Gummy Bears after the second day to gauge whether the strength of the alcohol is to your liking. If not, simply add or empty some vodka from the Tupperware. You may substitute Gummy Worms for Gummy Bears, however, avoid Red Fish and Swedish Fish gummy candies. These candies will not fully soak in the vodka and can sometimes result in an unpleasant goo., This fruity, makeshift candy cocktail can be enjoyed in each Starburst flavor.   Either separate the Starburst squares by flavor or mix the squares based on the taste you want to achieve. Fill an empty water bottle with about 10 unwrapped squares of Starburst. Use a funnel to pour 7 ounces of vodka into the water bottle. Shake well until the vodka begins to take on the Starburst's color. Let the mixture sit overnight to allow the Starburst to break down and blend with the vodka.Strain the liquid using a standard coffee filter. This will help separate chunks of Starburst and make the solution smoother. Pour the blend into containers that are freezer-safe. Glass bottles with seal-able caps are best. Freeze the cocktail for a few hours, then enjoy!  ",372,"['skittles', 'starburst-infused vodka drink', 'vodka-infused gummy bears', 'vodka']"
"['look for the right ingredients', 'make your own toothpaste', 'add whitening to your toothpaste', 'try oil pulling']",How to Reverse Tooth Decay Naturally1," If you want to help reverse tooth decay naturally, try looking for natural toothpastes. These toothpastes contain a combination of all natural ingredients, which accomplish the same thing as fluoride. They work by reducing the bacteria in your mouth with xylitol, a sugar alcohol that reduces how much plaque-forming bacteria attaches to your teeth. These pastes also contain calcium and phosphate, which are lost during demineralization of your teeth.Common commercial natural brands include:   Redmond Earthpaste Dr. Collins Restore Apagard Premio Tom’s of Maine Cavity Protection; , If you don’t want to buy your toothpaste, you can make your own out of natural ingredients. Start with four tablespoons of calcium (carbonate) powder, which come as tablets or powder. Mix it with two tablespoons of baking soda, ½ to 1 packet of stevia or Xylitol powder, and one teaspoon sea salt. To the dry mixture, add enough coconut oil to make it into a paste. Next, add a few drops of peppermint oil to help freshen your mouth. Mix the ingredients completely.   To use this mixture, just dip your toothbrush into the paste and brush like normal. You can make this in bulk and seal it in a jar to use over time. To avoid any possible spoiling of the ingredients, keep it in your refrigerator. , You don’t have to do without whitening if you make your own toothpaste. To make your toothpaste whitening, add two teaspoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide to the toothpaste recipe. When you use it, there will likely be foaming and perhaps some tingling, but this is how it should feel in your mouth.   Hydrogen peroxide works as a bleaching agent and is also antibacterial.  Don’t use anything stronger than a 3 % solution. The stronger concentrations may burn and irritate your mouth and gums., In addition to normal brushing, oil pulling can help reduce bacteria in your mouth. First thing in the morning, take one tablespoon of coconut oil or sesame oil into your mouth. With your mouth closed and without swallowing, swish the oil around in your mouth, getting between your teeth and around your mouth. Continue for 15 to 20 minutes. After you’re done, brush your teeth normally, then drink two to three glasses of water.   Do not gargle the oil. Make sure you do this before you have eaten or drank anything in the morning. This method has not been tested to see if shorter periods of time are beneficial, so try to perform it for the full length of time. ",418,"['whitening', 'toothpaste', 'oil', 'right ingredients']"
"['identify the pros and cons of debt management', 'attend credit counseling', 'find reputable debt management companies', 'ask questions before signing up', 'pay debts not included in the plan']",How to Avoid Chapter 7 Bankruptcy2," You can set up a repayment plan with a debt management company. With this plan, you make one payment to the company, who then distributes payments to your creditors. You may have to pay the debt management company a fee.These companies can’t get your debt load reduced. However, they often can get fees waived or your interest rate reduced, which will lower your monthly payments. Your creditor might also agree to let you make low payments for a limited amount of time. You can also contact your credit cards and ask for fees to be waived, so the counselor isn’t doing anything you can’t do. Nevertheless, debt management is a good option if you don’t like to negotiate or are too busy to try. You might need to give up your credit cards during the length of repayment. As a positive, debt management doesn’t affect your credit score very much unless the debt management company neglects to send payments to your creditors.  , You shouldn’t sign up for debt management until you attend credit counseling. Your initial counseling session will last about an hour.You can talk about whether debt management is a good option for you during your session.   In particular, ask how long it will take to go through a debt management program. It can take several years before you pay off your debts.  , Many credit counselors offer debt management services, so you could continue to work with a credit counselor if you like their agency. Be sure to research them so that you know they are reputable:   Search their online reputation. Look for any complaints that consumers felt scammed. Call your state’s Attorney General and check for any lawsuits or complaints filed against the company.Also check if the company needs to be licensed to practice in your state. Avoid any company that requests your personal information before explaining their services to you., You want to know what you are getting into, so ask the debt management company questions before agreeing to work with them. For example, think about asking the following:How much do they charge? Are there start-up and monthly fees? What happens if you can’t afford it? Is the company licensed to practice in your state? How does the company keep your information confidential? Can they help you create a budget for the future, even after your debt has been paid off? What services do they offer other than debt management? What credentials do the counselors have and how are counselors paid?  , A debt management plan probably only handles certain debts, such as unsecured credit card and medical debt.

An aptitude for seeking and recognizing the truth is a necessary part of good management skills. That is because managers are in a position of power, and it is only natural that those working under you may sometimes tell you only what you want to hear. Empathy is necessary to understanding those you manage, as well as your customers. To be a manager, you must know how to use persuasion to affect outcomes both in the workplace and in the consumer market. Leadership is almost synonymous with management, and is an integral part of any management training program. To be a manager, you must be able to guide others in a way that brings out their best. You must also be able to absorb stress in a way to shield employees from responsibilities that are not theirs, so that you can show them, by example, how to handle tasks. Managers must be able to resolve issues in a way that has the least negative impact on coworkers and customers, and they must be able to accept responsibility for any problems that arise, without deflecting or transferring blame to others. Understand that there is a difference between managing people and managing a project, and that you are responsible for doing both. Organizational and administrative skills enable you to develop budgets, track payroll, monitor employee performance, develop business strategies and much more.; , Go to the library, or search the Internet, in order to find texts that can guide you on the principles and applications of management skills.  , Develop a relationship with a manager that you respect and aspire to be like, and ask for advice and guidance. You may even opt to place an ad in the local or Internet classifieds section to recruit a mentor who can give you personalized management training.  , Managing a specific project, as opposed to moving into a permanent supervisory position, is a great way to gain management skills while maintaining a safety net during the process.  , An online search for management seminars will return a multitude of both on-site and webinar-style management training seminars.  , You may pursue an associates, bachelors or masters degree in business management from any college or university that offers such a program.

Make sure the people you work with don’t mind if you exercise next to your desk, in the break room, hallways, and near the printer. If they do mind, keep your exercises out of common or highly visible spaces., This is a great workout for your glutes. While you’re waiting for the coffee to brew, lift your leg behind you, keeping the knee straight. Repeat this 10 times on each leg.For an exercise aimed at your hamstrings, you can switch this up and do leg curls by kicking your leg up toward your buttocks, bending at the knee. Repeat this 10 times on each leg as well., Use the counter or the wall for balance. Lean over in plank position with your back straight and your core nice and tight. Place your hands shoulder-width apart and do 10 pushups by lowering your body down to the surface.Increase the number of pushups you do by five as this becomes easier for you! Keep your elbows tucked in close to your body and your spine straight for good pushup form.  , Either lift your leg up behind you or cross it over your other leg. Squat down on one leg only and hold the squat for 10-30 seconds (or as long as you can). Work out both legs.Hold onto the counter for balance if you need it.  , Raise yourself up on the balls of your feet (the top of your arches). Do as many raises as you can in one minute. Try to beat your record every time.Be sure to do a quick stretch for your calves after this by placing one foot behind the other, leaning against the wall, and putting your weight into your back leg. Repeat on both sides. You can use the wall or your desk for balance if you need it.  , Wall sits are perfect for working out your quads, back, and core muscles. Take a paper report or memo you need to read over to the side of your office and slide yourself down on the wall until your legs form a 90° angle with the floor.

"['choose an area of interest', 'research the organization', 'volunteer consistently', 'get a letter of verification from the organization']",How to Convince Your Parents You Don't Have to Be Involved with Sports or a Club3," Whether it’s helping a cultural group, mentoring younger kids, or volunteering at the local stable, choose a position and topic you’re interested in.   If you need ideas, ask your school’s guidance office for help in finding something beneficial to do outside of school. Volunteering can range from donating your used clothing to planting trees for Arbor Day.Consider teaching computer skills to the elderly or coaching a youth sport’s team., Once you've found an area of interest, you can look into organizations that explore that area. For example, you may find a local animal shelter to volunteer at if you love animals. You should do a little research to figure out how to volunteer. You should also make sure the company's ethics match your personal passions.   Learn about the volunteer process. How does one become a volunteer? Is there a training session? Do you have to be a certain age to volunteer without a parent? Can anyone volunteer, or do you have to meet specific requirements. Also, make sure the organization is a place you would be happy to donate your time to. Not every organization will match with your values. Returning to the animal shelter example, maybe you feel strongly against euthanasia. You would not want to work for a kill shelter if this is the case.  , Most colleges and hiring managers like to see consistency and commitment when it comes to volunteer work. Stay at the organization for at least 6 months to two years.   Work volunteering into your weekly schedule. If you're quitting a sports team or club to volunteer, you can use the time freed up to volunteer. For example, if you no longer have hockey practice on Tuesday afternoons, maybe you can use that time to do some volunteer work. Commit to the mission of the organization, and learn all you can in your time there. You'll want to be informed about an organization to come off as an active volunteer. Ask founding members about how the organization has grown and changed, and what their main missions and goals are. Get to know the people there, and keep in contact with them after you leave. You can use people you worked with as references down the road.  , Often times, colleges or jobs will need letters of recommendation or proof that you were where you said you were. Ask someone who supervised you for a letter.   Most organizations will understand the need for a letter of verification, so don't be shy about asking. Simply approach the manager of the organization and say something like, ""If you have time, could you write me a letter of verification proving I worked here?"" If you need the letter for a particular application, make sure you ask well in advance. Volunteer supervisors may be busy, and you want to make sure you give them enough time to compose the letter. By the end of your time with the organization, make sure you get your letter on official paper with the manager or your advisor's signature and dates of your service.

Be sure to use something that won't let water seep through it, and use a piece large enough not to let water seep past it.; , If using a graduated cylinder, fill it to the 100 milliliter line. If using a narrow jar like an olive jar, fill it with 100 ml (0.42 cup) of water and mark a reference line on the outside of the jar with a permanent marker. (If you don't have a measuring cup with metric measurements, use 1/2 cup of water.)   You can use either distilled or tap water, but whichever you use, use the same type of water from the same source throughout this project. The water will form a curved arc called a meniscus. Where the bottom of the arc falls is considered the correct point to read the water level on a graduated cylinder or to mark the water line on an unmarked jar.  , The straw will serve as your hydrometer. Note how far up the straw pokes from the top of the jar or graduated cylinder. You want the open end of the straw to poke no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of the container of water. If it does poke up more than this, add weight to the straw to keep it from floating up too high and flipping onto its side.   You can add weight either by adding more clay, plasticine, or gum to the outside of the straw at the sealed end, or you can drop small weights such as BBs, split shot sinkers, small nails, or pebbles down the inside of the straw until it floats at the right level.  , This point is your zero line.  , Your hydrometer is now calibrated for ""pure"" water (either distilled or regular tap water). From here, if you wish, you can mark lines above and below this line. Ideally, each line should be 1 mm (about 1/32 inch) apart, or at least as close as the width of the point of your marker will allow.   You may want to use multiple colors for your lines, such as red for the zero and 10-mm lines, and black for the lines between them.

If you start a YouTube channel, make sure you have a decent video camera and a place to set up.Some people make great money via YouTube, and have even gone so far as to make it their full-time job. This is rare, and can take years of hard work, so don’t expect a quick payout.  , Start reviewing new games; most people will not be interested in older ones. When a new game comes out, you can either buy it or rent it, though buying it will make making a profit difficult.

However, don't force these activities upon your child, because they will resent you for it.   Consider the child's special interest when choosing activities. Interaction may be easier when it centers around one of the child's passions. Find autistic children, teens, or adults whom your child can meet and befriend. Meeting other autistic people will help build your child's self-esteem and show them that they aren't alone. Keep the situation as enjoyable and low-stress as possible. Children learn and grow the most when they have the freedom to have fun.; , There's no point throwing a child into a social situation when they aren't sure how to relate to others. Autistic people find socializing especially difficult, so they will need more support in this area than most children their age.   Clearly explain social skills so that your child is not confused. For example, ""It's polite to look at people when you're talking to you. If eye contact feels uncomfortable to you,you can try looking at somebody's eyebrows, mouth, hands, or general direction instead."" Offer media that models good social skills. Many children's books will teach lessons (e.g. how to cope with a bully or how to share), and TV shows such as My Little Pony often teach constructive ways to respond to social situations. This allows children to learn in a fun, ""safe"" manner. Older children and teens might like self-help books about social interaction. Try picking up some well-known titles at the library, such as How to Win Friends and Influence People and The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. They may also be interested in wikiHow articles, or resources written by autistic people (such as Realsocialskills).  , Children learn by imitation, and your child will watch your actions to determine what is appropriate. Treat others with respect, ask questions, listen well, and take time to cool off if you feel angry or upset. Your child will watch you and begin doing the same.  , Respect your child's communication—verbal or nonverbal—and make time every day to talk and play together. When your child feels upset, ask them what's wrong instead of immediately punishing them, and offer to help them fix the problem and prevent it from happening again. This will help your child feel supported, and trust you enough to tell you if there are problems with friends.  , Most autistic children experience bullying in some form or another at some point because of their differences. They could be bullied by their classmates. Have regular conversations with your child, their teachers, and even the school principal to make sure that everything is okay for your child at school.  , Your child won't like socializing unless she feels that she is doing it by choice.

Search out part-time work in your area through various channels. Look for jobs that occur on different days of the week, or different times of day. Another option is to find one job that involves working from home. You may try online resources (like Monster, Glassdoor, or Career Builder), look on Craigslist, or search in your local newspaper. Carefully follow the instructions on the job calls, submit the necessary materials, and with any luck, participate in some interviews.   Be strategic with the jobs you select.

If you can keep your schedule the same from week to week, working both jobs will become a comfortable routine., It may be tempting to try and keep your jobs secret from one another. However, if your employers and/or clients are aware that you’re working multiple jobs, they can give you the time you need to get things done. They may be more respectful of your schedule. They may view you as an even harder worker.Make sure each employer understands that you can only work part-time from the beginning. The sooner you inform your employers of one another, the better.

Use a paper planner, or an online one, to pencil in both jobs, commuting times, breaks, and any other obligations or chores. Use different colors for various activities to help keep you organized., It is important to resist overlapping your jobs and trying to do both at once (such as being logged into a telecommuting job, while on the clock at your office job).

Usually, there is at least one thing, like mistreated animals or impoverished children, that you can’t help getting sad over. Use these to water up! Some other ideas that might get you teary-eyed include:   War Starvation Disease Death, Try to assume the position you were in at a time when you were teary-eyed for some reason. Then, as closely as you are able, mimic the motions, rate of breathing, and noises you made at that time. Though this might seem a little awkward, with practice your body’s muscle memory can be trained to activate your tear glands to water your eyes., You don’t have to be an actor to make use of actor’s tricks. By identifying with a character, either an imaginary one or a live-action one you’ve seen on TV, you can make yourself misty eyed.   Try to choose a character whose situation you can relate to. Relatable characters will make it easier for you to slip into their mindset, and from there, get the watering response going., Some phrases may have the ability to really upset you. Professional actors and acting teachers refer to this as a “power phrase” due to the fact that it can be used to give you power over your emotions. Simply repeat the phrase to yourself until you feel your eyes begin to moisten. Some examples of power phrases include:   ”I’m not good enough.” ”No one will ever love me.” ”I can’t do anything right.” ”Why does everybody leave me?”, Music can evoke a powerful emotion response inside of you, both in negative and positive ways. Think of a song that you find particularly depressing, and loop it in your head. You may also want to think about things you find sad or depressing as the music plays in your head.   To help yourself get into the mood to cue your eye watering, you might want to bring some headphones and a music player so you can listen to the sad song before you need your eyes to water.

"['choose nutrient-dense foods', 'add extra calories when you can', 'drink your calories']",How to Gain Weight as a Recovering Anorexic1," Nutrient-dense foods are foods that are calorie-heavy but also filled with nutrients our bodies need to fuel activity. These are essential for recovery, as they will help to restore normal levels of micronutrients in your body and decrease the risk for developing conditions associated with nutritional deficiencies, such as osteoporosis or hair loss. While certain foods, like empty carbs and junk food, can move the number on the scale up fast, they're not as healthy an option as going for high-calorie, nutrient-dense choices.   Nutrient-dense foods are beneficial in that you need to eat less to gain the benefits. This can be particularly helpful to people recovering from anorexia, who struggle to adjust to typical portion sizes. A small or medium serving of a nutrient-dense food provides needed calories and nutrition.A nutrient-dense meal generally includes high-protein options mixed with fruit, veggies, and healthy carbohydrates like brown rice and whole grain pasta or bread. Some examples of nutrient dense food include salmon, chicken, walnuts, bananas, flaxseeds, shellfish, whole grain bread, olive oil, brown rice, oatmeal, yogurt, and dried fruits without added sugar.; , When you have an opportunity to add an extra 50 or 100 calories, take it. Any amount of calories helps the process of gaining back weight.   Plant fats, such as nuts, are healthy and high in calories. Add mixed nuts to a salad. Nut-based spreads, like almond or cashew butter, can be added to toast and sandwiches. Hummus is made from chickpeas, and can be a great dip or addition to a pita wrap.Consider adding extra salad dressing to salads or pasta, ketchup or mayonnaise to grilled meat or sandwiches, sour cream to Mexican dishes. When possible, opt for high-calorie condiments and dressings such as ranch, mayonnaise, thousand island dressing, and Caesar salad dressing.Granola, loaded with nuts and dried fruits, is a good source of nutritious calories and can be added to yogurt or eaten as a snack.Drizzle canola or olive oil, which both contain healthy fats, over salads, soups, casseroles, and whole grains.  , Many calories can be gained by drinking beverages that contain nutritious calories. Liquids aren't as filling as whole foods so you can add nutrients and calories without feeling bloated.   Good, healthy liquid choices include 100% fruit juice, kefir, skim milk or milk alternatives (such as soy or almond milk), buttermilk, and teas sweetened with natural sweeteners like honey. Smoothies, made from fruits and veggies, are ideal. They are calorie-heavy, easy to consume, and can be bolstered with a variety of healthy additives like wheat germ, nut butter, and protein powder.Meal replacement smoothies and drinks are also a good choice, and available at most groceries stores. For optimal weight gain, however, eat them in addition to solid food snacks and bolster them with fruits, powdered milk, or soft silken tofu.",465,"['calories', 'extra calories', 'nutrient-dense foods']"

Dodging can be very effective, but make sure you get completely out of the way or you could still get hit. If your opponent is using a lightsaber, get even further out of the way, as they can change the angle of attack partway through.  , If you have some experience in Shii-Cho, you should already know this.

A leg block (zones 5 and 6) consists of holding your lightsaber near your hip, with the blade pointing downwards. A body block (zones 2 and 3) consists of holding your lightsaber near your waist, or slightly higher, with the blade pointing upwards. A back block (zone 4) consists of holding your lightsaber at the back of your head, with the blade pointing downwards.  , If you can spin your lightsaber very fast on either side of you, in a figure-eight motion, you can create a nearly impenetrable blade wall.

"['cut into a raw jackfruit', 'turn the jackfruit inside out', 'boil or roast the jackfruit seeds', 'roast the jackfruit seeds in a cast-iron pan']",How to Eat Jackfruit2," If you’d like to prepare a raw jackfruit for yourself—whether for the experience or for the fruit—you’ll need to go about it in a specific way. Take a sharp chef’s knife and cut the jackfruit in half.  You’ll see a large, white central stem: cut this into small pieces and remove it.  , To do this, you’ll need to have a firm grasp on the outside of the jackfruit half. Clearly visible segments of fruit will stand out (it’ll look a little like pulled pork); grab a segment and pull it out from the jackfruit body. Tear this fruit segment open, and extract the seed.Repeat this process until you’ve extracted all of the seeds from both halves of the jackfruit. Jackfruit produces a very sticky sap that will cling to your hands, clothes, knife, and cutting board, and make the process of cutting the fruit difficult. To avoid this, slather your hands and knife in vegetable oil, which will diffuse the sticky sap.  , Jackfruit are flavorful, and taste approximately like a mixture between a banana and a pineapple, with mango-like hints of flavor as well. The seeds are the actual fruit of the plant, and will be the fleshy material contained in cans of jackfruit that you purchase. The seeds are tasty on their own. To prepare them, you can boil the seeds for 10–15 minutes (until soft), and then eat them directly. For a firmer texture, roast your seeds in the oven at 400°F (204°C) for 20 minutes.Jackfruit are difficult to peel properly; the exterior is prickly and thick, and once you cut through it, you’ll find that the interior is gummy, sticky, and difficult to cut apart (as described above). The fruit is in pods which are challenging to extract. For this reason, it’s easier to purchase already prepared and canned jackfruit from a grocery store or an Asian market, rather than cutting through an entire fruit on your own.  , In Southeast Asian cultures, jackfruit seeds are often cooked on a charcoal grill and eaten while still hot. This gives the fruit a delicious smoky flavor. If you’d like to approximate this method of cooking but don’t have your own charcoal grill, you can roast the seeds in a cast-iron pan. The heat from the pan will cook the seeds consistently through.Cook the jackfruit seeds at 400°F (204°C). Use your oven light to check the seeds every 5 minutes. You’ll know they are done when the jackfruit seeds break open and the fleshy fruit “pops” out from the inside.  ",423,"['jackfruit seeds', 'raw jackfruit', 'cast-iron pan', 'jackfruit', 'roast']"

First, turn your body so that your side is closer to the camera than your front. Stand with your back straight, shoulders down, and chest out. Finally, flex your stomach to bring in your waist..Don’t stand flat-footed. Instead, balance your weight on the ball of your feet.Ladies should cross their feet while they stand. This will slim their hips and can also make a photo more interesting.; , Keep your arms away from your body to make them look slimmer. If you’re a woman, put the hand closest to the camera on your hip and point your elbow behind you. This will elongate your arm and help it look toned. Men can put a hand in their pocket, holding the arm away from their body. Next, hide your other arm behind your body or gently rest it on a chest-high surface.   If you have to face the camera directly and want your waist to look smaller, put both of your hands on your hips.Hold purses or bags slightly away from your body or over a self-conscious area., A well-defined jaw will make you look slimmer in photographs. Bring your head towards the camera by extending your neck. However, don’t simply point your chin at the camera as this looks unnatural. Angle your head slightly as you pose by tilting it to the left or right.Remember to keep your back straight while you pose. Otherwise, you may look like a turtle with your head stretched out. Men should consider growing a beard that will help accentuate the jawline.  , Turn your body away from the camera towards your picture partner. Balance your weight on your back foot and drop your hips, relaxing your front leg. Put the other hand around or on your partner’s shoulder. If you want to look extra slim stand slightly behind your partner. Remember, never flatten your arm against your body.Women can put the hand closest to the camera on their lowered hip and push their elbows back. Men can put a hand in their pocket and push the elbow out.  , Never be the closest person to the camera. This will make you appear larger than anyone else in the photo.Next, either put your hands on your hips or around the shoulders of your picture partners. If you can choose who you stand between, choose people with similar body types to your own. This will reduce a contrast between body types in photos.   If you’re especially self-conscious about your arms simply put them around your picture partners’ waists. They won’t be seen in the picture at all.

"['set the two fractions equal to one another', 'take the two equivalent fractions and multiply across the equals sign in an ""x"" shape', 'introduce a variable', 'use cross multiplication for equations with multiple variables or variable expressions']",How to Find Equivalent Fractions4," We use cross multiplication for math problems where we know the fractions are equivalent, but one of the numbers has been replaced with a variable (typically x) for which we must solve. In cases like this, we know these fractions are equivalent because they're the sole terms on opposite sides of an equal sign, but it's often not obvious how to solve for the variable. Luckily, with cross multiplication, solving these types of problems is easy., In other words, you multiply the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other and vice versa, then set these two answers equal to each other and solve.Take our two examples of 4/8 and 8/16. These two don't contain a variable, but we can prove the concept since we already know they're equivalent. By cross multiplying, we get 4 x 16 = 8 x 8, or 64 = 64, which is obviously true. If the two numbers are not the same, then the fractions are not equivalent.  , Since cross multiplication is the easiest way to determine equivalent fractions when you must solve for a variable, let's add a variable.   For example, let's consider the equation 2/x = 10/13. To cross multiply, we multiply 2 by 13 and 10 by x, then set our answers equal to each other:  2 × 13 = 26 10 × x = 10x 10x = 26. From here, getting an answer for our variable is a matter of simple algebra. x = 26/10 = 2.6, making the initial equivalent fractions 2/2.6 = 10/13.    , One of the best things about cross multiplication is that it works in essentially the same way whether you're dealing with two simple fractions (as above) or with more complex fractions. For instance, if both fractions contain variables, you just have to eliminate these variables at the end during the solving process. Similarly, if the numerators or denominators of your fractions contain variable expressions (such as x + 1), simply ""multiply through""by using the distributive property and solve as you normally would.For instance, let's consider the equation ((x + 3)/2) = ((x + 1)/4). In this case, as above, we'll solve by cross multiplying:  (x + 3) × 4 = 4x + 12 (x + 1) × 2 = 2x + 2 2x + 2 = 4x + 12, then we can simplify the equation by subtracting 2x from both sides 2 = 2x + 12, then we should isolate the variable by subtracting 12 from both sides -10 = 2x, and divide by 2 to solve for x  -5 = x    ",430,"['x', 'multiple variables', 'equations', 'variable expressions', 'use cross multiplication', 'shape', 'equivalent fractions', 'sign', 'fractions', 'variable']"

To make your own whitening toothpaste, simply mash a 2-3 strawberries in a cup and add ½ a teaspoon of baking soda to clean your teeth. This paste can be used a few times per week with improved results over a longer period of use. Since the malic and citric acid in strawberries can erode enamel, use this remedy in conjunction with a fluoride toothpaste.Make sure you floss afterwards, as strawberries have tiny seeds that can get caught between your teeth and in your gums.; , Potassium, magnesium, and manganese can be found in a ripe banana. These three vitamins can help remove stains and clean teeth. Simply peel a banana, take a small strip of the peel, and rub it on the surface of your teeth for two minutes every day. Be sure to brush afterwards., Apple cider vinegar is a multipurpose household product which also has natural teeth whitening properties. Although results may not be instant, using apple cider vinegar in conjunction with baking soda can help remove surface stains and whiten your teeth. To make your own teeth whitening paste, mix two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar with ½ teaspoon of baking soda, which can be used a few times per week. You can also simply use apple cider vinegar as a natural mouthwash along with your daily oral care routine, by swishing 1 fluid oz. in your mouth after meals for 2–3 minutes., Coconut oil is a natural emulsifier which helps clean your teeth, reduce stains and fight off plaque and cavity causing bacteria. Mix a small amount of mashed peppermint or spearmint leaves (approx. 1–2 grams) with 2–3 tablespoons of coconut oil to use as a whitening paste or mouthwash. The peppermint leaves help keep your breath fresh throughout the day. Since coconut oil is gentle and non-abrasive, it can be used daily and is safe for people with sensitive teeth and gums., Instead of using toothpaste, dip your toothbrush into a sea salt mixture for 3–5 minutes, made by dissolving ½ teaspoon of salt in 1 fluid oz. of water, and brush your teeth with it. The salt temporarily increases the pH balance of your mouth, turning it into an alkaline environment in which germs and bacteria cannot survive. A salt water mouth rinse after meals can also help keep your mouth and throat clean while soothing and healing mouth sores., Neem twigs and miswak sticks are used in many cultures to clean teeth. After chewing the bark off the end, you can separate fibrous bristles in the pulp of the wood, which can be used to brush the teeth as normal. The act of chewing and sucking on the twigs likewise helps to clean the mouth.",469,"['neem', 'teeth', 'use bananas', 'strawberry', 'use sea salt', 'use coconut oil', 'use apple cider vinegar']"

Radiation can also help keep a tumor from returning after surgery. In conjunction with chemotherapy, radiation can help relieve thymoma symptoms in patients with late-stage tumors, such as painful breathing or chest pain. However, radiation by itself is not the most effective treatment option., Radiation involves the use of invisible high-energy rays to destroy cancerous cells. This helps stop them from increasing and multiplying. The type of radiation used depends on the amount of energy that is required to remove your thymoma as well as how far the thymoma may have spread.If you opt for radiation therapy, you will work with a doctor who is called a radiation oncologist.  , A CT scan is an effective way to create images of your body. It involves taking a number of X-rays at different angles and then combining them to visualize cross-sections of your body.A CT scan can help your oncology team determine the correct dose and position of your radiation therapy., The most common type of radiation that is used is external beam radiation therapy. It uses x-rays from a machine just like the usual x-ray procedure, only these x-rays emit a much more powerful radiation.The procedure does not hurt, but it may cause side effects later including: fatigue, skin redness, weight loss, poor appetite, nausea, and vomiting. These are all due to intense amounts of radiation, which may normal cells along with cancerous cells.Many side effects are temporary and can be relieved with medications.Another type of EBRT that is used is the three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT). This procedure is able to accurately target a malignant tumor while also affecting less of the surrounding tissues. This means that this procedure has less side effects than regular radiation therapy.Most radiation therapy is done for a few minutes at a time, for several days a week, continuing for several weeks., IMRT is an advanced form of 3D-CRT which can also be used to remove thymomas. The procedure relies on a computer to more accurately target the cancerous tissue. The beams and intensity of the radiation can be adjusted to prevent harming nearby healthy tissues., The source of the radiation can also be an implant that is placed directly on the tumor using needles or catheters.This form of radiation therapy is called interstitial or internal radiation. Internal radiation is usually given to outpatients for several weeks. You are not radioactive during or after the treatment.

"['make some fake blood', 'fill an eye dropper with the blood', 'squeeze the blood out at the base of your nostril']",How to Fake a Nose Bleed2," Dripping blood is fresh and oxygenated, so you need a fake blood recipe that is more watery and a bit brighter than the fake blood used for dried smears. Light corn syrup can accomplish this effect. Adding corn starch thickens the mixture to the right consistency, and the addition of laundry soap makes the blood less likely to stain.   In a small bowl, mix together 2/3 cup (150 ml) light corn syrup, 1/3 cup (75 ml) warm water, 3 to 5 tsp (15 to 25 ml) red food coloring, 2 to 3 drops blue or green food coloring, 5 Tbsp (75 ml) cornstarch, and a squirt of liquid laundry soap. Continue mixing until evenly combined into a smooth mixture. Note that you can adjust the amount of red food coloring as needed to achieve your desired shade. If the blood seems too thin, add more cornstarch. If it seems too thick, add more water.  , Squeeze the tip of a clean, empty eye dropper and dunk the mouth of the dropper into your fake blood. Release the tip to draw the blood into the body of the dropper.   A syringe without a needle could also work if you do not have an eye dropper. Essentially, you just need a tool that you can use to control the application of fake blood. That tool must have a mouth that is small enough to fit into one nostril, however.  , Hold your heat straight and place the mouth of the dropper at the base of one nostril. Slowly squeeze the bulb so that fake blood comes out in a mild trickle. The blood should pour down from the base of your nostril to your mouth in an even stream.   To make the process easier, use a mirror when applying the blood. Note that you may not use all of the fake blood inside the dropper. You only need to use enough fake blood to create one steady trail. Do not squirt the blood directly into your nostril. The tip of the dropper should be on the outside of your nostril, at its very base. The body of the dropper should be pointed up and slanted off the one side. Only apply the fake blood to one side of your nose for a more convincing nosebleed. The conclusion of this step marks the end of this method.

Think about how you will use it before selecting the book. While any style of notebook might work for you, you can also find books made specially to be a Book of Shadows in occult or magic stores. Some considerations to help your decision include:   The binding: Do you want it to be covered in fabric or spiral bound? Lined or unlined: While lined makes it easy to write on, unlined gives you greater freedom when writing or drawing and making diagrams. Recycled: It is nice to consider the environment and choose a book that has minimal impact, in line with your nature-based beliefs. Cover: If you wish to decorate it, a blank cover is easiest, although you can always cover any printed design with blank paper first, then create your own design over the top.; , There are various options for decorating the book, either by painting or drawing, sticking on symbols or printed and covering them with contact paper or using an existing Book of Shadows image and gluing it in place. When designing the decorations for your cover, the following ideas might be of help in inspiring you:   Triple moon goddess Pentagram Infinity sign Your astrological symbol Planetary symbols A cross (If it goes with your religion) Clavicula Nox Or anything else you think would be appropriate.  , While you don't have to divide the Book, you can do so if wished. Use dividers and tape them in place. Divide your book into four sections:   Spells Astral projection journal (such as a dream journal) Dream journal Cheat sheets (references for incense, herbs, moon phases, etc.)  , For example, if your four main dividers are on top, use dividers on the side.

"['make sure your trees are ready to be tapped', 'select trees', 'purchase taps', 'tap the tree', 'attach a collection container', 'tap more trees', 'collect the sap']",How to Make Maple Syrup1," Maple season occurs during the spring when nights are below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) and days are starting to get warm. This causes the sap to start flowing in trees.  The maple season is over when this temperature pattern ends. At this time the color of the sap will become darker. If sap is collected after the season is over it will be low in sugar content and have an undesirable taste.; , There are many different types of Maple trees. Various types have different sugar content; the higher the better. The Sugar Maple has the highest sugar content. The maple tree has a distinct five point leaf. Typically, a tree should be at least 10 inches in diameter before it is tapped., These are also known as spiles.Online is the easiest place to buy taps. Most taps are the same, but the collection containers differ quite a bit. Determine what style of collection container you will use: a bag, an attached bucket, a ground bucket, or a tube network (usually used by advanced syrup-makers). If you don't feel like buying a bucket, a clean milk jug will work fine. Avoid buying and installing a tube network if you haven't tapped before., Drill a hole on the side of the tree that receives the most light, above a large root or under a large branch. The hole should be the size of your tap. It should also be around 1 to 4 feet (30 to 120 cm) above the ground and a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) longer than your tap. The hole should be at a slight downward angle.  An electric hand drill works well for this task. You could also drill a hole using a hammer and a long nail; hammer it in, then remove it.  , It is best to cover containers to keep out rainwater and bugs., 40 gallons of sap makes just one gallon of syrup, which is why store-bought maple syrup is so expensive. A good number of trees to tap for a beginner is 7 to 10; you'll get about 10 gallons from each tree per season, so you'll end up with a few gallons of maple syrup., Over the course of a few weeks, check the collecting containers every few days.Transfer the sap to sealed buckets or other large containers for storage. Keep collecting sap until the season has ended. Now you're ready to turn the sap into syrup.",408,"['tree', 'collection container', 'select trees', 'purchase taps', 'trees']"

Position the vodka cap in the center of the watermelon. Use a serrated knife to “trace” around the edges of the vodka cap, creating a circle.  Stay as close to the actual cap size as possible, because you will eventually place your vodka bottle inside the hole that you’ve carved, and you want the fit to be snug so there are no leaks.; ,  Take the vodka cap off the watermelon, and use the knife to cut and follow the traced circle you just made. Place the knife point down on the edge of the circle and insert the knife about halfway. Cut out this piece as if you were carving a pumpkin.Continue cutting around the traced circle until the entire circle is carved around.  ,  Use the knife to pry at the plug by inserting the knife at the cut edges, and bringing the knife down, underneath the plug, to create a 45-degree angle.  This will create a wedge that can pop the watermelon plug out of the carved hole. Refrigerate the watermelon plug in a re-sealable plastic bag so that you can reinsert it later. Save the vodka bottle cap to seal the vodka later.  ,  Scoop out enough watermelon flesh with a spoon or melon scooper to create a hole deep enough that the vodka bottle neck can fit fully into the watermelon.  Be careful of watermelon juice and pulp splashing. This can make your workspace wet and sticky.  ,  Stand the watermelon upright so it’s length is perpendicular to the surface space you are working on. Carefully tilt the watermelon on its side to meet the opened vodka bottle, and insert the bottle into the hole in the watermelon.The entire bottle neck should be able to fit in the watermelon hole.  If you have a friend nearby, they can hold the watermelon up and in the air a little bit and guide it to meet you, holding the opened vodka bottle. Your vodka bottle will be at about a 90 degree angle to you, and parallel to your work space when you insert the bottle.  ,  Rotate the watermelon until it is back on a resting position on your work space, with the vodka bottle now upright and centered. Leave the watermelon to absorb the vodka for at least 12 hours.The vodka should absorb about half, to the whole bottle of vodka.  ,  Remove the bottle of vodka once the watermelon has absorbed all the alcohol. Insert the watermelon plug back into the hole and place in the refrigerator (with the vodka hole facing upward), if you are not planning on cutting and serving the water immediately.

"['supervise your dog at all times during the first few weeks', 'be consistent', 'be firm', 'not angry', 'praise the dog for correcting unwanted behavior']",How to Set Consistent Limits for a New Dog3," To help reinforce the limits you have set, make sure your dog is supervised at all times during the first few weeks it is in your home. This helps you correct any behavior that you see and doesn’t let your dog get away with things when you’re not looking.When you are not around your dog, place it in a crate. This helps control your dog’s movements.  , The most important thing about setting limits for your new dog is to be consistent. This means you can’t let the dog get away with things sometimes and punish it for the same thing later. Dogs need to understand what is expected of them. If you set limits, make sure to follow through each time.For example, if you don’t want your dog on the couch or to eat from the table, don’t let it do that sometimes, but then get mad when the dog tries the same action later. Make sure you don't give in to whining, begging, barking, or sad eyes. You must stay consistent no matter what your dog does to get you to give in. Don’t give it a ""treat” by lessening the limits. This confuses the dog.  , When correcting unwanted behavior, you should reprimand your dog in a firm voice. However, you should not treat your dog in an angry or frustrated manner. This could frighten the dog, which does not lead to a good relationship filled with respect.When the dog does something unwanted, in a firm voice say, “No!” Don’t yell or scream at the dog. Refrain from hitting the dog or any other kind of physical violence as punishment.  , The way to enforce the limits you have set is to let your dog know when it has done what you wanted. Whenever it corrects the behavior after you tell it “No,” praise the dog somehow. You may pet it, give it verbal praise in a happy tone of voice, or give it a treat.For example, if the dog gets on the couch, you may tell it “No.” When the dog gets down, praise it for the correct behavior.

If an item isn’t on your list, and you can’t justify buying it, keep moving. The irony of Black Friday is that prices are often so low that people are tricked into buying things they have no real use for. In doing so, they end up spending more than they would have on a typical outing.Stay focused and practice a little self-control when you run into attractive but unnecessary deals. Having concrete items and figures in mind, like making a list or setting a budget, can keep you from dropping money on extra purchases you may regret later.  , The items that comprise your shopping list should all come from Black Friday savings offers. The whole point of Black Friday shopping is to secure goods at markdown, so ignore non-sale items for now. The more you spend on regularly-priced goods, the less you’ll have available to buy more of the things that end up saving you money. If you’re not careful, you’ll just end up racking up added expenses that set you back, defeating the purpose of the commercial holiday.Sometimes, stores will advertise products at prices that aren’t much lower than what they ordinarily cost. Take advantage of the biggest discounts you can and bypass the rest.You can always come back later and buy other items with the money you saved doing your Black Friday shopping.  , Hold onto your receipts in case you decide to bring something back and be aware of how individual stores handle returns and exchanges. It may be that you give someone something they already have, or you get home only to be confronted with immediate buyer’s remorse. In these cases, making use of returns can put some of that hard-earned holiday cash back in your hands.Stash your receipts in your wallet or pocketbook to help you keep up with them, or file them away in a separate folder back home. Some return policies may be subject to change on Black Friday. Be sure to read the fine print and don’t miss your window to take an unwanted item back.  , One option for Black Friday shopping that a lot of people tend to forget about is simply not participating. Decide whether saving $30 or $40 is worth the tedium, exhaustion and stress of surrendering your whole day for a chance to make mad grabs at the local mall. Remember, your time is valuable too. The hours you give up waiting in line or fighting your way through angry mobs could be spent enjoying the holidays with your loved ones.If you just can’t let a bargain pass you by, avoid the chaos and capitalize on Black Friday savings by doing your shopping online through participating sites.

This will help you lose body fat, and since breast tissue is composed mostly of body fat, you will likely notice a reduction in your bust size, and improved general health.Since it can be uncomfortable for women with large busts to run and jog, try lower-impact cardio exercises such as walking, using an elliptical, or riding a bike.  , Building and toning your chest muscles, especially the pectorals, may decrease your bust size and help improve your overall health. Here are a few exercises that will tone and tighten your chest muscles:Push ups. Barbell Bench Press. Dips. Even if you do not notice a reduction in breast size, these exercises can help tone and strengthen your body, preventing the back pain and discomfort that often plagues women with larger busts. It’s a good idea to work with a personal trainer who can tailor a workout plan and recommend specific exercises to tone and tauten your chest.  , If you are unable to accept your large bust size or are experiencing health problems as a result of your bust size, conduct research on breast reduction surgery. This procedure, also known as reduction mammaplasty, removes excess tissue and skin from the breasts so they are reduced in size. If you are a teenager or young adult uncomfortable with their larger bust size, physicians usually recommend waiting on the surgery until your breasts are fully developed. Some doctors also suggest waiting until you have had children or your family is complete since pregnancy leads to changes in breast tissue, which may impact the results of the surgery. Research suggests that breastfeeding after this surgery is also more difficult. If you are considering breast reduction surgery, meet with a board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss the procedure, learn about the cost, and decide if you think it would improve your health and body image.  , Before you decide that surgery is the best way to deal with a larger bust, talk with your doctor or a medical professional about your concerns. If your large bust size is affecting your health or causing you discomfort, your doctor might have a way to address these issues and alleviate these problems.  , If you are struggling to accept your large bust, consider meeting with a counselor or mental health professional. They can provide support and advise you about how you can learn to accept your body.   While it is natural to feel unhappy about a certain aspect of your physical appearance, if these thoughts become overwhelming and interfere with your daily life, you may be experiencing body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).

The swelling occurs in the angle of the jaw. In the early stages, the swelling sits to either the left or the right side. The longer the mucocele has been present, the more it spreads and it can be difficult to tell which side it arose from.If you notice something isn't quite right with the dog's chin, make a mental note of which side was swollen first. This helps the vet figure out which gland is damaged. If in doubt as to which side is affected, stand directly in front of the dog and compare one side with the other to see which is more swollen. The swelling will probably feel a bit squishy when you press it, like a fluid-filled balloon.; , This swelling can be more difficult to spot. Sometimes the swelling is subtle and can be there for a long time before it becomes large enough to be noticeable. This swelling looks like large pink bubbles or cysts under the tongue, and they can reach a size where they displace how the tongue sits and push it over to one side. Swelling under the tongue can also cause problems chewing or cause bloody saliva.To check for swellings under the tongue, watch the dog very carefully when she yawns. Alternatively, open her mouth and gently move the tongue to one side so that you can get a look underneath.  , In rare cases, a salivary mucocele might appear at the back of the throat or on the eyelids.A salivary mucocele on the throat can cause difficulty swallowing or breathing.One in the eye can cause eye pressure and pain.Look for swelling along the eyelids or in the throat region.  , Since salivary mucoceles aren’t generally painful, your dog won’t display signs of pain. A salivary mucocele in the mouth can make it hard for the pet to eat because the tongue is displaced. This can cause her to bite down on her tongue or make it difficult to eat.She may also have trouble chewing on toys.  , Sometimes, saliva in the mouth may be bloody. This is as a result of trauma to the salivary gland.The saliva will likely be pink tinged or light red.  , If the dog has a salivary mucocele on the throat, it might not be detected from the outside. Instead, look for signs of respiratory distress or any trouble swallowing. These symptoms should be seen by a doctor immediately since the mucocele can blow the airways., In some cases, especially when left untreated, the mucoceles can reach large sizes and become infected. This can cause pain and damage to the tissue. Look for large pockets of swelling accompanied by pain., Any dog can get a salivary mucocele regardless of breed or age. However, some breeds are at a higher risk than others. Dachshunds, German Shepherds, Poodles, and Australian Silky Terriers are at a high risk for salivary mucoceles.",502,"['tongue', 'difficulty breathing', 'bloody saliva', 'infection', 'chin', 'dog', 'places', 'risk breed', 'trouble', 'salivary mucoceles']"

Dry skin is prone to sagging, which produces lines. So make sure you apply a light moisturizer in the morning before you start your day. Simply rub the moisturizer into your skin using small, circular motions. A moisturizer with SPF in it is ideal so that you can prevent new lines from forming without having to buy another product.You can look for a light moisturizer that is ideal for your skin. Research moisturizers that are best for skin types such as oily, wrinkled, depending on what your skin is like.; , A thicker and more intense cream is best for when you’re winding down your day and preparing for bed. A cream that contains retinol is ideal to use. The vitamin A in retinol helps plump up the skin, which reduces fine lines and wrinkles. You can buy a cream that contains retinol, or have a stronger retinol prescribed by your doctor.Apply extra moisturizer to the frown lines between your brows.  , Natural oils not only smell great, but they can also be really great for your skin! Buy a bottle of pure almond, grapeseed, or jojoba oil at your local health food store. Along with their antibacterial and anti-oxidant properties, natural oils are awesome because they provide many of the same benefits as expensive moisturizers at a much lower cost. Apply a small amount to your face and rub it in using small, circular motions.Natural oils are also great because they provide a barrier for your skin during harsh and cold weather.  , Keeping moisturized can be frustrating if you have oily skin. No one with that skin type wants to add even more oil. A product containing a humectant is a good solution for that problem. A few humectants are glycerin, propylene glycol, urea, and sorbitol. Apply the product to your skin daily, nightly, or whenever you feel the need to moisturize., Keeping hydrated is an important part of keeping your skin moisturized. This may be something you already do, and if so, good job! Don’t worry if you don’t drink a lot of water right now. This is something you can accomplish easily. Try to drink at least 8 cups of water per day. If drinking plain water is difficult for you, infuse the water with lemon or other fruits, like strawberries., Sheet masks seem like all the rage right now, and that is for a reason! Masks are a quick way to add moisture to your skin, and they are so relaxing. You can use a sheet mask, or one that comes in a cream form. Use a mask about once a week, or twice a week if your skin is very dry. Apply the mask, sit back, and relax with your favorite music for 10 to 20 minutes.You can buy masks online, at your local beauty store, or at many supermarkets with a beauty section.

"['', 'measure or guess the distance to your subject', 'or whatever you are focusing on', 'set the aperture and shutter speed', 'look through the viewfinder', 'and aim your camera', 'press the shutter release to take a photo and wind the film on']",How to Use a Voigtlander Vito B 35mm Camera2,", A rangefinder is useful, but not essential; longer distances are quite easy to guess (and are more forgiving of errors); at shorter distances, use a tape measure. Turn the distance ring so that the red triangle immediately behind the ring matches up with the guessed or measured distance. , If you have a light meter, use it; if not, experiment. A full explanation of these functions is beyond the scope of this article, but some brief reminders can be given here: A larger aperture (smaller number) means less depth of field (i.e. less of your scene in focus), and more light being let onto the film. A smaller aperture will let less light onto the film, and give more depth of field. To demonstrate, turn the distance ring to 8 feet (2.4 m) and look at the red markers. At an aperture of f/5.6, the portion of your scene from about 6.5 to 11 feet (2.0 to 3.4 m) will be in focus. At an aperture of f/16, the portion from about 4.5 to 60 feet (1.4 to 18.3 m) will be in focus.  A faster shutter speed (a larger number on the shutter speed ring; the ""100"", for example means 1/100th of a second) will let less light onto the film. A slower one will do the opposite. If you have a cable release and a tripod, you can use the ""B"" setting, which will hold the shutter open for as long as you need it to.  Therefore, you can compensate for a smaller aperture by using a faster shutter speed, or a larger aperture by using a slower shutter speed. Compensating for lack of light with a slower shutter speed can result in motion blur (or blur from unsteady hands); compensating for it with the aperture will result in less depth of field. Which you will do, will depend from scene to scene.   , Remember, you're not looking through the lens, as you would be on an SLR; you're looking through what is not much more sophisticated than a hole in the top of your camera.

Simply apply it just like the first coat, wiping off after 2-3 minutes. Let it all dry for another 6-8 hours before moving on.   Do not add this second coat until the first has finished drying.  , Stain is for looks, but it will not protect the wood from moisture, oils, or warping. For that you will need to finish the final piece, protecting both the wood and your stain. You can choose from the following options:   Water-based polyurethane Polyurethane Wood lacquer Finishing oils, Using a clean cloth or foam brush, simply apply a thin, even coat of polyurethane to the wood, then let it dry. Don't worry if it looks milky or white as you apply it -- it will dry clear.   Water-based polyurethane is, by far, the easiest finish to apply, though it is less protective of water or oil than other finishes., Apply 2-3 thin coats, making sure there are no bubbles on each one. Let each coat dry, then sand it with 220 grit paper before applying the next one.   This is the thicker, almost plastic-like clear coating on many tables and desks. If your furniture is going to be prone to nicks, scratches, and scuffs, this is your best bet for protection.  , To apply it, use a paint sprayer and aim for an even coat throughout. A natural-bristle brush can also be used, but you must work quickly, as lacquer dries quickly. Let it dry, using a brush to remove any bubbles or unevenness, then sand with fine-grit (220 or higher) paper. Apply 2-3 more coats, sanding between each one.   Lacquer is harder to apply but worth the effort for expensive pieces.  , Apply a little bit of oil to a clean rag and rub it into the dry, stained wood. Let it soak according to the oil's instructions, then rub it off with a clean rag and apply 1-2 more coats.   If the piece is subject to lots of wear and tear, this is not a very protective coating.

They're weapons don't fire faster or have more damage. They don't have better perks.*However I tend to think they do. So don't worry about their rank or anything, do whatever you can to not be intimidated.; , Look for those players, ignore all the other players. However don't go and get yourself killed by ignoring other players or getting less kills by just going after the higher ranked player.  , If you have a microphone headset, tell the level 55 that your coming after him.  , If your wanting to get the level 55 player then be sure to use an assault rifle(best to do with overkill where you can carry two weapons{ex. sniper rifle and M4}). Usually a sniper rifle isn't the best matching rifle to hunt someone of a level 55's stature. Reasoning behind this is because when you're in a game with a good 55, chances are you will not be seeing them a lot, so a sniper rifle is a no no.  , If you have the thought in the back of your mind that they are level 55 and that you're gonna get stomped; specially in cage matches then your most likely going to get beat, or it'll be close, unless they aren't as good as you might be. I always have confidence, cause I have beaten a level 55 that was way more experienced than me in a cage match before. So be sure to have confidence in yourself.  , Being scared of an opponent isn't a good thing. Just keep reminding yourself that you can do this, and that it's not that hard.  , Be sure that you don't just play abnormal. Remember what all you've learned through your online campaign. Instead of going through, guns blazing, revert to stealthiness and aim. It'll get you much, much, much further and a higher score.  , The main focus of Call of Duty is intimidation. A player who is intimidated, is in a 1/6700 chance to not playing their best. So make sure at the first games, your finishing at the top of the final scoreboard(preferably 1st of course).Basically you want to take Step 5 and have them not follow it. You want the opponent to have that nasty thought in the back of their head, on that you are too good for them.  , Headshots win the game for snipers.

As soon as you see a clump of hair, grab your hand-vac and pick it up. Or, wipe down the area with a wet paper towel to remove dander as well. This constant up-keep may seem tedious, but it will create a cleaner home., Dog hair has a tendency to get stuck in carpeted floors, which reduces scatter, but can create an unsightly accumulation of fur. At least once a week, spend a bit of time vacuuming your floors and baseboards. To remove dog hair on hardwood floors, use a wet sweeper or mop., Even if your dog isn’t allowed on the furniture, its hair will find its way there anyway. Avoid ruining your furniture by investing in quality slipcovers or simply throwing sheets or towels over your couch or chairs. Wash these covers on a regular basis and take them off when you are expecting company.Some dog owners also find it worthwhile to purchase furniture with slippery fabrics, such as leather, which makes it possible to wipe off any hair accumulations. If you choose to forego slipcovers, remove dog hair from fabric furniture by putting on a pair of rubber gloves and then wiping your hands across the item’s surface.Don’t forget to clean your window coverings as well, especially if they are made from textured fabrics. They will accumulate dog hair over time, often concentrated in the parts close to the floor., This is a great option for in-home quick hair removals and for removing hair from clothing. Simply roll a sticky roller over the object and the hair is picked up. The best investment is to purchase a washable roller that you can throw in the laundry between uses., If your dog is shedding hair they are likely dropping dander and dead skin cells as well. To remove these potential allergens, it is a good idea to use a plug-in air purifier. You can get a small purifier to place in a central location in your house fairly cheap., Your dog's own dander and hair may make their own allergies worsen over time. If you find that your dog seems to suffer from an ongoing cold, if they sneeze a great deal, or itch their skin constantly, you may want to consult with your vet.

"['position yourself in a comfortable way', 'inhale through your nose', 'breathe deeply from the diaphragm', 'exhale through your mouth']",How to Breathe1," You might find it easier to take deep, slow breaths if you are lying down or sitting in a comfortable chair. Try laying on your back on a blanket, sofa, or on a bed. Let your arms lay loosely at your sides. You can keep your legs straight or bend your knees slightly.You can also use pillows to support your head and knees. Just try to make yourself as comfortable as possible.; , It is best to breathe in through your nose when doing deep breathing, or even just when you are breathing regularly. The process of breathing through your nose allows your body to filter out viruses and bacteria.To breathe through your nose, keep your mouth closed. Your automatic nervous system will continue breathing, and the breath will come through your nostrils. Nasal breathing allows the body to warm and humidify any cold, dry air so that it's easier to absorb., To tell whether or not you are breathing into your diaphragm, put one hand on your upper chest, the other hand on your belly, just below your rib cage. Breathe in slowly through your nose until you feel your belly start to rise. Try to make sure that your chest remains still, and that it is not moving upward. When your belly is as full of air as you can comfortably make it, start to tighten your stomach muscles. This will force air slowly from your diaphragm and out of your lungs.The diaphragm is the large, dome-shaped muscle at the base of the lungs. When you allow your diaphragm to expand and contract to control your breathing, you'll breathe more easily and efficiently. Breathing from the diaphragm can slow your heartbeat and lower or stabilize blood pressure.You may get tired rather quickly from this exercise, but you will soon find that the strengthened diaphragm muscle allows for increased oxygen intake and energy.  , When you exhale, part your lips slightly and push the air out of your mouth using your diaphragm to force the air up and out. You should feel your diaphragm fall as you do this. Pause for a moment after exhaling your breath and then take in another breath when you feel ready.   Try doing deep breathing for five to 20 minutes every day.",379,"['comfortable way', 'diaphragm', 'mouth', 'nose']"

In order to do that effectively, you should take some time to think about what is most important to you. Are you trying to advance your career? Or build more solid personal relationships? List your priorities. You can start by simply writing down all of the important things in your life. Once you have a list, you can go through and rank them in order of importance. Did you put ""Finish my MBA"" at the top of your list? Then consider that your number one priority.  , After you have figured out your priorities, it is time to create goals. You want your goals to be realistic and attainable. Don't set yourself up for failure.List some goals that you can achieve in a reasonably short amount of time. For example, you can say, ""Within one month I would like to have applied for 6 new jobs."" You can also set some personal short term goals. For example, you can write, ""I am going to make it home in time for dinner with my family four days a week.""  , It is also a good idea to create some goals that will take longer to accomplish. When listing your long-term goals, remember to keep your priorities in mind. Also remember to list things that are reasonable and attainable.A long-term goal could be, ""I will be promoted to Senior Analyst within the next year."" An example of a personal long-term goal might be, ""I will travel to visit my extended family for a week each summer.""  , In addition to listing goals, you should consider writing a personal mission statement. This is a document that outlines your values, goals, and skills. It can serve as the framework for future goal setting.To start, list your core values. These might be something like: family, career, education, spiritual health, etc. Identify what you want to accomplish. For example, you might write, ""I wish to make the world a better place by being a great dad and an excellent attorney. Then include the ways that you will make those things happen. For example, ""I will spend time with my son every day and offer him encouragement.""  , When you are creating your goal-related documents, don't forget to include some physical goals. Your physical health is important. The mind-body connection means that the health of your body will impact your moods. If you don't feel well, it can be hard to make positive life changes.Get plenty of rest. Most adults need about 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Eat a healthy diet. Choose meals with a combination of fresh fruits and veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins. Exercise. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week.

"['look into whitening agents', 'consider mole removal creams', 'know your medical procedure options']",How to Remove a Mole at Home1," Over-the-counter skin bleaching creams can be used to treat the mole. They work by slowly discoloring the mole until it is less obvious, particularly for flat moles with no raised borders. The mole will still be present, but not as easily visible.   Look for a cream that contains 2% Hydroquinone, an ingredient that is available over the counter and is FDA approved. Hydroquinone works by reducing the appearance of melanin in the skin on which it is applied.Follow the manufacturer's instructions for use, taking care to test the cream on a small inconspicuous area of skin before using it on your mole. Also be sure to only apply the cream to the mole, and not the surrounding skin.; , Mole removal creams such as Nevi-Skin are a fairly cost-effective method to treat. Use them with caution, as their claims have not been evaluated by the FDA.   Be sure to carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions, and stop treatment immediately if you have an adverse reaction such as bleeding, irritation, or swelling. Know that they also sometimes remove more than the mole, leaving pits in your skin and causing scarring.One product, DermaTend, gained popularity as a method of treating moles. It contains extract of a plant called Sanguinaria Canadensi and is said to work by killing the mole at the root and causing it to fall out. The company's claims were not evaluated by the FDA,and in 2014 it was recalled because the FDA worried that use of this product would prevent people from seeking dermatological care and thus could delay diagnosis of skin cancer., Currently, there are three methods you can talk about with your doctor:Excision with stitches: In this process the mole is removed and the area is closed with one or more stitches. Some scarring is a possibility, but this method can be used if a mole is suspicious so that surrounding tissue can also be excised.Shave excision: In this process the mole is cut off at the level of the surrounding skin. Scarring is less common, but this method is not preferred if a mole is suspicious, because surrounding skin (which may contain cancer cells) will remain untouched. Shaving works best on moles that are raised, because moles that are flat have to be ""scooped"" out of the surrounding tissue, which inevitably leaves a scar.Cryosurgery: Cryosurgery is application of extreme cold to kill an unwanted tissue using liquid nitrogen. You will not need any stitches, and recovery time is generally faster than excision methods.",416,"['mole removal creams', 'medical procedure options', 'whitening agents']"

For this technique, you want to purchase eyelashes that are made for the outer corners of the eyes, or half lashes.They may look a bit funny in the package, because they are short strips that will not cover your entire lash line. Depending on the look you want, you can purchase extremely dark, long lashes, or shorter, more natural ones.   Make sure you purchase eyelash glue as well! You can find both products at your pharmacy or local beauty supply store. If you cannot find lashes made specifically for the outer corner, you can always buy regular lashes and cut them yourself.  , You want to apply any eyeshadow and eyeliner before you apply your false lashes. If you try to apply shadows or liners afterwards, you will likely get products into the false lashes, which will make them look less bold and defined. Consider the false lashes as the cherry on top of a completed makeup look.   You can do winged eyeliner to enhance the look of your winged lashes.  , Before you apply your false eyelashes, it’s good to give your natural lashes a curl and one coat of mascara first. Curl your eyelashes with a curler, holding it down firmly for about five seconds. Do this at the base of your lashes, the middle of your lashes, and again at the tip. Apply one, light coat of your favorite mascara.By curling and darkening your natural lashes, they will blend into your false lashes more seamlessly.  , You can do this in a couple of ways. You can squeeze the glue from the bottle directly onto the strip of your lashes, coating the band in an even line of glue. If you prefer, you can squeeze a bit of glue onto a surface, and then carefully run the band of the lashes through it.After you’ve checked that there is glue on the entire strip, let the glue dry a bit so it is tacky, rather than runny.  , Once the glue is tacky, hold your eyelid taut with your finger. Then, carefully place the false eyelashes along your outer corner lash line. You can apply the lashes with your fingers or with tweezers.   Once you’ve ensured that your lashes are placed in the correct spot, press them firmly into the base of your lash line.  , This is important to ensure that the half lashes blend into your natural lashes. If you desire, you can apply a coat of mascara to your eyelashes, to add a bit more intensity and ensure that everything blends fully. By applying these half lashes to your outer corner, you create a gorgeous, winged look that makes your eyes look big and bright.

"['choose the kind of basil you wish to grow', 'start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost', 'prepare seed containers', 'plant the seeds', 'remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge']",How to Grow Basil1," Basil comes in many different varieties, each of which have a unique flavor and smell. Read up on different types of basil and pick out one - or several - that appeal to you, then order the seeds or buy them at a garden store. Here are a few ideas:   Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice, and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers. Lemon basil actually contains citral, an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit, and smells very lemony. Purple basil is often grown for decoration, as well as its scent and flowers. There are perennial basils which come back year after year, like African Blue Basil (which has pretty blue veins on its leaves) and Thai Basil, while most other varieties are annuals, which you'll have to plant year after year. Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow, but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained.; , Basil needs warm air and sun to do well, so it's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they'll get damaged by frost.   If you live in a hot climate, you can start the seeds outside instead. To figure out when the last frost will be, consult an almanac or talk with other gardeners in your area.  , Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite, vermiculite, and peat. Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets. Dampen the mixture with water so it's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate.  , Drop one to two seeds into each container. Cover them lightly with soil. Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap, so they stay moist. Leave the containers in a sunny window. Twice daily, remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water.   It is important to keep your basil seeds warm after you plant them. You might consider using a heat mat or an overhead lamp to keep them warm.  , When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil, it's time to remove the plastic wrap.

It costs about 8-9 Medals, but it lasts a lot longer than a regular Axe (136 uses for the Silver Axe compared to the 32 uses of the Axe), plus the trees you cut down with it has a chance to spawn a rare tree stump design, which is when the tree rings from cutting down a stump has a cute design instead, like a leaf, or the Triforce symbol.  You can get medals from completing the minigames in the Island.  , For the Gold Axe and Silver Watering Can, you’ll need the Gardening Store. The store opens five days after the player has created their town, and you need to have pulled weeds or planted flowers a combined total of 30 times.  The store can be found between the Nookling store in Main Street and the Able Sisters’ Store, and it takes at least 1-5 days for the store to be built.  , To get the Gold Axe, you’ll need to buy a total of 50 Saplings from the store. Leif, the sloth shop owner, will then give you the Gold Axe upon purchasing the 50th sapling. The Gold Axe spawns less stump patterns that the Silver Axe, but never breaks., Much like the Gold Axe, you need to buy 50 Seed Packets of Flowers from Leif, and he’ll hand you the Silver Watering Can when you get the 50th. It waters a wider radius than the Watering Can., Here’s the tricky bit: you need to get the town to “Perfect” status and retain it for 15 days. To do so, you need to make enough “good” Public Works Projects, plant enough Trees and Flowers without crowding the town, make sure to keep items scattered on the ground (excluding seashells, buried gyroids and fossils, mushrooms, and flowers) to a minimum, and pull weeds every single day. And you need to maintain this for 15 days. When you do this, talk to Isabelle in the Town Hall and she’ll hand you the Gold Watering Can. The Gold Watering Can has an even wider radius than the Silver one, and can turn wilted Black Roses into Gold Roses when you water it.  Proclaiming a Beautiful Town Ordinance as Mayor will keep the flowers from wilting and spawn less weeds, but costs 20000 Bells to enact, and only 1 Ordinance can be enacted at a time. Public Works Projects, like adding benches and fountains and streetlights, can increase the town rating, but “ugly” projects—like big screens, flashing lights, the drilling rig, and especially the garbage—can will decrease it. While you only need to plant a certain amount of trees (somewhere between 100-200 trees in total), you can have as many flowers as you want, as long as it’s more than 50.

"['teach labeling through touch', 'read together', 'give your child words for feelings', 'talk about color']",How to Teach Your Blind or Visually Impaired Child to Talk1," Young children learn to speak through identifying objects. Start with objects that are easy to identify and your child enjoys, like a ball. Allow your child to touch it and feel it. Say the word as they feel it. Have them touch it and feel it as long as they are interested in the object.For example, say, ‘Do you want your ball? That’s a ball. You’re touching a ball.”; , Reading can help your child learn new words and concepts. Listening to stories over and over again can help build vocabulary skills and can help your child learn to anticipate new words. It can also help them understand the structure of stories, which will help them with reading and writing in the future.Use tactile books that provide interesting textures and activities for your child to explore. This might include things to pull, put together, or move. Find books and stories that interest your child and keep their attention. Don’t be afraid to re-read books again and again, as this can help them develop better language skills.  , Start to introduce feelings words when your child is frustrated, mad, happy, sad, etc. if your child is frustrated, label their feeling and let them know that you see that they’re upset. Let them know what they can do when they have these feelings, too.Say, “You feel angry. Yes, I can tell because you are yelling and shaking your fists.” Teach your child words to get your attention when they need help. For example, they can say, “Help” or “Sad.”  , It can be difficult to teach a blind child about color. You don’t have to make color a taboo subject, yet don’t over-emphasize it either. It’s important to teach your child colors of objects, especially their own things. If your child loses their backpack, for example, the first question someone might ask is, “What color is it?”Teach color to your child by making comparisons to high and low tones in music. For example, say, “There are lots of colors, just like there are lots of notes on a piano. Some colors are soft while others are loud. Just like you can play the same note in a different octave, different colors can have different shades.”  ",373,"['color', 'child words', 'touch', 'feelings']"

"['get outdoors', 'get plenty of exercise', 'get plenty of rest']",How to Chill3," Above, we've dealt with specific, individual ways to chill out. However, this isn't telling the whole story — in order to truly live a chilled-out life, you'll want to adopt habits and behaviors that encourage a happy, relaxed state of being. One sure-fire way to do this is to make an effort to regularly spend time outdoors. It may seem clichéd, but large-scale scientific studies have proven that spending time outside — especially getting moderate exercise — noticeably elevates mood.Though the connection between time outdoors and a good mood still isn't 100% understood, sunlight seems to be a key part of the equation. In fact, studies have shown that being exposed to bright (artificial) light in the morning when it would normally be dark out can help people with Seasonal Affective Disorder feel better.For long-term benefits, try making outdoor activity a part of your weekly schedule. For example, going for a short hike every Saturday morning is a good way to get yourself feeling relaxed and energized for the rest of your weekend.  , As noted above, a single session of exercise is a proven, fast-acting cure for stress in the short term. However, regular exercise is also a great way to promote a relaxed, chill attitude in the long term. Though the biology behind the process isn't perfectly understood, scientific research has demonstrated that habitual exercise can act as a buffer against the sorts of unhealthy problems that can result from stress, especially depression.Check out our comprehensive article on exercise for all sorts of useful information on making exercise a part of your life, including sample routines for every skill level.  , The way we sleep can have a major effect on the way we feel when we're awake — just think back to the last time you pulled an all-nighter and try to remember how you felt the next day. While a single night of missed sleep can make you feel bad for a day or so, consistently getting insufficient sleep can be a major source of stress in the long run. In fact, people who consistently get poor sleep have elevated risks of suffering from stress-related disorders like heart disease, stroke, and more.For the best chance at a healthy, chill life, make an effort to get enough sleep every night (most health resources recommend about seven to nine hours per night for adults.)It's also important to recognize that the relationship between sleep and stress works the other way as well. In other words, just like a lack of sleep can lead to stress, stress can itself can make it difficult to get to sleep.  ",437,"['plenty', 'rest', 'exercise']"
"['figure out your main fear', 'identify your symptoms', 'understand panic attacks', 'keep a journal']",How to Overcome a Fear of the Hospital1," Having a fear of hospitals is a very common phobia. There are many reasons that people might be scared to enter these buildings. For example, some people are afraid of blood. Others might fear being separated from friends and family during a procedure.Reflect on what it is that you actually fear. Are you nervous about procedures that can cause pain? Do you have a fear about not waking up from surgery? Figuring out what you are scared of is the first step in finding ways to cope. Identify your particular fear and acknowledge it. Admit your fear to yourself. Try saying, ""Hospitals make me anxious because I worry about being around sick people.""; , There is a difference between getting nervous around hospitals and having a phobia. Having a phobia can be as debilitating as any physical ailment. Pay attention to your symptoms so that you can figure out whether what you are coping with is nerves or a more serious disorder.Generally, people with phobias will experience physical symptoms when having an attack. That means that when you are near or in a hospital, your body will react in a certain ways. Phobias cause different reactions in everyone. Some common symptoms are heart palpitations, chest pains, and dizziness. You might also experience nausea or difficulty breathing. Feeling weak and having ""fuzzy"" vision are also common symptoms.  , Many people who have a phobic condition have to cope with panic attacks. A panic attack can cause frightening emotions and physical reactions. Understanding panic attacks can help you cope with your fear or phobia.A panic attack makes it very difficult to think rationally. During an attack, it can be difficult to separate reality from things that are not actually happening. For example, a panic attack might cause someone to feel like they are having a heart attack. It can also cause you to lose control of your emotions. If you have experienced a panic attack, it is a good idea to consult a medical professional. This may indicate that you are dealing with a phobic condition rather than mild anxiety.  , In order to fully confront your fear, it is useful to gather as much information about your fear as you can. Writing down attacks and particular events can help you keep track of your feelings. Try keeping a journal to track your symptoms.If you are near or in a hospital, write down your reactions. Include the circumstance of your visit and who was there with you. Track your symptoms. For example, if you experienced blurred vision, write it down. Look for patterns. For example, you might notice that driving by a hospital does not cause a reaction, but walking by a hospital does.  ",452,"['symptoms', 'main fear', 'panic attacks', 'journal']"

Take your dog on short walks in nearby areas, and end the walk when you notice your dog slowing or struggling.Depending upon your dog’s overall mobility, it may be advisable to avoid areas like dog parks and dog beaches, as other well-meaning dogs may be too quick or rough for your dog to handle. Play games such as fetch and tug-of-war in the home, too, to help keep your dog from getting stiff throughout the day.  , Giving your dog a gentle joint massage for five to ten minutes every day can help relieve some of their pain and keep them from getting too stiff. Give your dog short messages in the areas that bother them most.Gently massage your dog’s muscles in small, circular motions along the areas where they experience regular pain. Firmness should be only slightly greater than what you use to pet or scratch your dog. Support your dog during the massage by wrapping your arm under their stomach and helping them stand, if necessary. Try not to rub areas that currently aggravated. If you notice your dog wince or express pain, stop massaging that area immediately.  , If you are a dog owner who swats their dog for an accident or rubs their nose in the mess, adopt a non-physical form of punishment. Acting physically against your dog may rapidly increase joint pain and could cause greater damage.Eliminate physical punishment and instead opt for speaking in firm and severe tones to communicate your discontent. You may consider not giving the dog a regular treat as a part of punishment, but never deprive them of food, water, or other basic necessities such as shelter. If your dog has regular accidents, consider getting indoor training pad meant specifically to be thrown away after your dog to does their business.  , As your dog experiences new joint problems, the way in which you play and interact with them may change. You may have to spend less time playing rough and more time simply petting or showing affection to your dog. Regardless, you should show your dog support by ensuring they get attention every day.Spend the same amount of time you would have typically spent with you dog before they began having joint problems. You may be doing different activities, but you don’t need to cut back on time with your dog because of their joints. If your dog is no longer able to run and play, try lower impact activities such as slow-paced games of fetch in the house, or even taking your dog for a swim.

This can prevent you from getting split ends.It won't take much longer for the cotton to absorb all the moisture than it would take for you to use a blow dryer.  , Take the time to remove all the tangles from your hair before going to sleep at night. The process will prevent natural oils from collecting to much near your scalp. By combing your hair, you will spread the oils more evenly over the hair.   Put long hair in a loose bun. Be sure to tuck the tips to prevent getting split ends. Use a hair tie to keep it in place over night. Silk pillowcases can also help give your hair a better night of rest. The smooth fabric will be gentler on your hair., Your hair craves fatty acids. They can help moisturize a dry scalp by increasing the natural oils produced by your body.Eat a healthy amount of salmon, avocados and olive oil in your diet to get plenty of healthy fats that will help keep your hair healthy. Avoid diets that will drastically reduce the amount of healthy fats you consume as it will have negative affects on your hair health.  , Use lower temperatures when styling your hair, and give your hair a break from heat styling from time to time.

Usually this can only be done for a few days as it inhibits other work and the pressure is usually on to get the walls up. A possible drawback of this method, especially if soil or clay is used, is the chance of staining the concrete.  , A simpler way is to just keep water sprayed onto the slab with garden sprinklers or hand held hose pipes. Following are some disadvantages that you need to consider if you intend to use this method:   This method is very wasteful of water Again, it can only be done for a short period usually. If you hand water, it should be wet all the time, that is you should not let it dry out at all, almost impossible to do.  , The sand cover or hessian has to be kept wet and if they do dry out they actually aid in sucking moisture out of the concrete.  , This is one of the most efficient methods of curing concrete. Usually a spray from a hose pipe is used to wet the surface and the plastic is laid on, with generous laps at the joints. Use timber or cement blocks to keep the plastic in position, rather than taping the joints. To a certain extent the plastic can be used a few times. A major benefit of plastic is that it does not stop other work, like building the walls, and so it can be left in position for weeks if need be.   The photo shows concrete columns that have had the form work stripped (for further use) and then wrapped in a clear plastic film. The evaporation from the concrete condenses on the inside of the plastic and the surface of the column remains moist.  , These compounds and oils now come in a variety of types. Used the water soluble waxy emulsions that can be sprayed onto the fresh concrete with a hand pump type spray. They are milky white when used but dry into a clear waxy film. They have the advantage that that they can be sprayed onto footpaths and the like even before the concrete is set enough to walk upon. Another major use is on concrete walls. They remain on the surface for weeks and finally break down in sunlight. Be hesitant to use concrete curing oils on internal floors, on the off chance that any residue would stop the full adhesion of ceramic tile glues etc.   Other types of concrete curing compounds are PVA based, chlorinated-rubber or resin based.

"['wash your hands often', 'avoid sharing needles', 'practice safe sex', 'wear protective gear', 'avoid sharing toiletries', 'watch out for contaminated substances']",How to Lower Your Risk of Developing Viral Hepatitis1," Hand washing is one of the simplest and most effective ways to avoid getting hepatitis. The steps to effective hand washing are:   Wet your hand with clean water. Apply soap to your hands and work up a generous lather. Scrub your palms, the back of your palms, each finger, in between all your fingers, your fingertips, and your fingernails for at least 40 seconds. Rinse your hands thoroughly in clean water. Dry your hands with a clean towel. Rubbing alcohol, hand rubs, and hand sanitizers can also be used. Be sure to scrub for 20-30 seconds.; , Because different strains of hepatitis are so easily spread through infected blood, never share needles with anybody.   This includes drug needles, tattoo needles, and medical needles. Be sure to use only new and unused needles, and remember to dispose of all used needles in a sharps container.  , Viral hepatitis can easily be transmitted sexually.   Using condoms properly and limiting your number of sexual partners can help lower your risk of contracting the disease.  , If you are ever in a scenario where you will be handling any sort of bodily fluids, or where you may come into contact with bodily fluids, be sure to wear the necessary protective gear.   Wearing protective gear while performing physical work can also help you avoid cutting your skin, making it harder for your blood to come into contact with the bodily fluids of others. Here are some common and effective pieces of protective gear:  Gloves Face masks Goggles    , To minimize your chances of getting hepatitis, avoid sharing your personal toiletries with others, especially those items most likely to come into contact with blood or other bodily fluids such as:   Toothbrushes Razors Nail clippers  , Since hepatitis is transmitted through a variety of different substances, it’s helpful to avoid coming into contact with or ingesting the following:   Contaminated food, especially from places with poor overall sanitation. Unclean water, especially from unknown sources or from regions with poor sanitation. Residual stool or urine on surfaces such as toilets and urinals, especially in areas with poor sanitation. Doorknobs, handrails, and other items touched by many peoples’ hands. Tip: Washing your hands and, whenever possible, disinfecting surfaces using a disinfectant that contains at least 70% alcohol can help minimize the potentially negative effects of coming into contact with these types of unclean surfaces.

Guinea pigs have very sensitive skin and this can hurt them.Use a soft baby brush or a metal greyhound comb to remove loose hair and keep your guinea pig’s coat shiny and healthy.; , De-shedding tools are typically metal combs designed to catch loose fur when you brush it over your pet’s fur. Any de-shedder will work for your guinea pig. Ones designed for small cats and kittens work especially well.   Be sure to avoid damaging your guinea pig’s sensitive skin. De-shedding brushes and combs can be sharp and abrasive, so take care to be gentle when using a de-shedder.  , Cleaning your guinea pig’s cage daily or at least several times a week is vital to their health. Since your guinea pig doesn’t get immunizations at the vet like dogs and cats do, they are more susceptible to illness if left in a dirty cage. This can cause a variety of health problems, including infections that can trigger hair loss.Avoid using harsh chemical cleaners when you clean your guinea pig’s cage. Instead, opt for mild soap and water or a solution of vinegar and water. Make sure the cage has time to dry before you put your pet back in it., It’s important to keep in mind that you won’t be able to completely stop your pet from shedding. Guinea pigs, especially long-haired ones, shed seasonally, so you can expect to find more hair than usual when they lose their winter coats in the spring and early summer., Baby guinea pigs’ fur thins out to make room for their thicker, slightly coarser adult fur to grow in. This is a natural process and cause of shedding and is nothing to be concerned about.For this stage, there are no preventative steps to take because it’s a necessary part of your guinea pig growing into a healthy adult. To minimize the mess from this shedding process, keep their cages cleaned out and sweep or vacuum your home to pick up extra hair.

Note that people who only view your profile without commenting, liking, or otherwise providing physical proof of their presence will not usually appear on either list. The interaction Facebook uses goes both ways. In other words, the people on your chat sidebar or timeline are people you talk to frequently and those who talk back frequently, as well. The list is not strictly composed based on people who frequently view your profile. This may help you figure out who visits your profile most frequently depending on how active you are on Facebook. If you rarely initiate interaction on Facebook or interact equally with a large number of people, the people who interact with your profile will carry greater weight in determining who appears on your chat sidebar or timeline. When using the friends list on your timeline, you may need to refresh the page several times to get an accurate reading. The friends you interact with frequently will appear time and time again, but a few random friends will always be thrown in, as well.

Supposedly, the top five people listed in each category are the friends in each category that view your profile most often.  , In your Facebook search bar, begin typing out a search request simply by typing the first letter of a possible request. Do this one letter at a time, deleting the initial letter before starting with a new one.   If you recently visited a friend whose name starts with that letter or frequently visit a friend whose name starts with that letter, that friend will be the first in the list to appear. On the other hand, if you type a letter that does not belong to such a friend or if a person whose profile you rarely visit shows up at the top of the results, there is a decent chance that the friend who shows up is either the last person to visit your page whose name started with that letter or the person who visits your page the most.  , Your friend suggestions can provide hints about who might be checking out your profile even though they are not on your friend's list.   If you receive a friend suggestion from someone with no shared or mutual friends, there is a decent chance that the person being suggested is someone who visited your profile.

"['determine which zone you are in', 'determine which datum to use', 'determine the easting', 'determine the northing']",How to Read UTM Coordinates,"   The world is divided into 60 UTM zones.; ,   When you are using UTM coordinates, you need to make sure that you are using a common UTM datum. For instance, you should check to make sure or your GPS is set to the same datum as your map or guidebooks or you should make sure that a search party knows what datum you are using for your coordinates. The reference datums that are most commonly used in North America are NAD 27 CONUS and WGS 84. Here is how reference datums work. The reference datum is the one place on map from which you measure to all of the other places. Picking a different place to measure from can significantly change the coordinates. If you use different datums in your GPS and on your map, you can end up in the wrong place.  ,   The first number in UTM coordinates in called the easting. The easting refers to how far east you are. If you are using a map, look at the numbers found along the edge of the map that correspond with the UTM coordinates. The easting coordinates will be found along the top and bottom of the map. If you are using a GPS, the easting will be the first number when it is set in UTM mode. A change of 1 number in easting coordinates, for example 510,000 mE to 510,001mE, is a change of about 1 m (1 yard) on the ground. If you walk from 510,000 mE to 511,000 mE without changing your northing, you will have walked approximately 1 km (.62 mi.) Interpolate easting coordinates on a grid to determine an exact location.  ,   The second number in UTM coordinates in called the northing. The northing refers to how far north you are. If you are using a map, look at the numbers found along the edge of the map that correspond with the UTM coordinates. The northing coordinates will be found along the right and left of the map. If you are using a GPS, the northing will be the second number when it is set in UTM mode. A change of 1 number in northing coordinates, for instance 510,000 mN to 510,001mN, is a change of about 1 m (1 yard) on the ground. If you walk from 850,000 mN to 851,000 mN without changing your easting, you will have walked approximately 1 km (.62 mi.) Interpolate northing coordinates on a grid to determine an exact location.

There are many products on the market, and while they're all made to restore moisture to hair, you should find one that's tailored for your specific needs.   If you have kinky, textured hair, look for products made specifically for kinky hair. If you have fine hair, look for products that are described as ""light"" or ""weightless."" Products made with heavier oils will make your hair look weighed down. If you have curly hair, look for products designed to keep your frizz at bay.; , Use a gentle shampoo that won't strip your hair too much. Avoid shampoos made with sulfates, which are abrasive cleaning agents that cleanse hair of its natural oils and lead to dryness and breakage.         , Squeeze a dollop about the size of a quarter into your hands and rub your hands together. Then apply the product to your hair, beginning about halfway down the shaft and moving towards the tips of your hair. Then spread the any product that remains on your hands from the roots to the tips. Pay special attention to the tips, which tend to get drier than the rest of your hair. If necessary, use a wide-toothed comb to distribute the product.        , Deep conditioning treatments require at least 10 minutes get to the core of each strand of your hair. Check the instructions on the product you are using, as some may suggest being left on longer, but most should work in 30 minutes or less.You may want to keep the conditioner in place by covering your head with a plastic shower cap, but this is optional.  , Some products suggest using hair dryer to heat up the product in your hair, which allows it to get absorbed into your hair more easily. Use a blow dryer on a low setting to direct hot air at your head and thoroughly heat up the product.Make sure the hair dryer doesn't get too hot, since you don't want to melt the plastic cap if you are using one.  , Remove the shower cap and rinse your hair with cool water, which will tighten the hair shaft and make it look shiny. After rinsing, towel dry your hair gently, then let it air dry and then style as usual. Your hair should be bouncy, glossy and well-conditioned.

If possible, practice mindful walking in a natural setting. A nearby park that has walking trails or a garden is ideal. Even a neighborhood that has a lot of trees is a good choice. Walking in nature can help boost the stress-relieving effects of mindful walking. Many people find nature peaceful. It can be a good escape from a busy, city life. , Mindfulness is just another word for paying attention.As you walk, take note of how your body feels. You aren't trying to change anything at this point, just be conscious of the feelings in your body.Don't just walk with a flurry of racing thoughts going through your head. Instead, pay attention to your body and your environment as you walk. Mindful walking is about giving yourself a break from all the stressful thoughts that may be going through your mind.Notice how your feet feel with each step. Be aware of your posture; if you are standing up straight or bent forward or hunched over. Notice if your hips feel tense or tight. Take note of how you swing your arms. Notice how you breathe while you are walking.  , After you've taken stock of your body feels, focus on the world around you. Pay attention to colors that are around you. Focus on your environment, whatever it may be.Look at the scenery around you, the buildings if you are in the city, or the nature if you are somewhere that has plants. Look to see if there is anything on the ground, or what the sky looks like on this particular day. Try to immerse yourself fully in the objects that are all around you, rather than thinking about other things.  , Once you get used to being present in your body and environment, begin to shape your breathing and posture. Stand straight and take deep breaths.   With each step, imagine that there is a string holding you up from the crown of your head. This string goes through your entire body and is connected to your feet. Become aware of your breathing, and consciously take breaths from the bottom of your belly. Walk as quickly or slowly as you want and your ability allows, while remaining aware of your movements, environment, and breathing.  , If you find your mind drifting to thoughts about anything other than walking, breathing, or your surroundings, notice your thoughts and let them pass. Return your attention back to your feet, the imaginary string holding up your head, and your surroundings.   You may have to practice returning your attention back to walking, but that is a part of the exercise. All that matters is that you are noticing your thoughts, then returning to mindfully walking.

First, you'll no longer be embarrassed by your secret fear. This will help you start to deal with the anxiety.Second, you'll be able to ask others for help, especially when you get stuck.   Consider attending a self-help group for people facing similar fears. You might benefit from talking with and supporting others experiencing the same challenges you are.  , Sometimes, it is easier to face your fears knowing that you are not the only one. Your family and friends may not understand what you are going through, but the people in the self-help group may. The people in that group may also offer up advice on how they managed or overcame their phobias. Some of that advice might work for you as well., Different people have different learning methods. Some people learn better through experiences, while others must read and analyze the material. Some books might even focus on certain types of phobias.  , Some people might need additional help overcoming their phobias, especially if it that gets in the way of their daily lives. For example, an extreme fear of open spaces or talking to people, might prevent someone from going out to a store and buying food and other necessities.  , Studies have shown that this combination can help reduce anxiety.A great example of this combination is a turkey sandwich.  , While many assume that citrus is the best source of Vitamin C, you should actually try eating: yellow bell pepper, guavas, black currants, and red chili peppers., This can be especially helpful when you are trying to face your phobia. Consider using any of the following essential oil: bergamot, chamomile, jasmine, lavender, or ylang ylang. Here are some ways in which you can use essential oils:   Mix a few drops of essential oil into a carrier oil, such as coconut or jojoba, and massage it into your skin. Add a few drops of essential oil into your bath. Consider making some homemade bath products using essential oil. A simple sugar scrub consists of 1 part sugar, 1 part coconut or olive oil, and a few drops of essential oil.Make your own oil diffuser by filling a bottle with warm water and adding 20 to 30 drops of essential oil.

Go for turtlenecks that completely conceal your neck or try popping the collar on a collared shirt.A turtleneck is probably a better option, as a collared shirt may not completely conceal the hickey. Keep in mind people may get suspicious if you're wearing shirts that conceal your neck for several days in a row. Try concealing with a shirt for a day or two and then switch to another method.  , This can be a cute way to conceal the hickey while adding a little flare to your outfit. A scarf, a bandana, or even chunky jewelry, like a chain necklace, can temporarily conceal a hickey.Much like covering your hickey with clothing, people may get suspicious if this is your go-to method for days. Try to add some variation to the accessories you use, and move on to another method after a day or two.  , If you have longer hair, you may be able to cover up your neck area. This is probably not a great solution for full day coverage, but it can be used if you need to temporarily conceal the hickey. For example, you may be hiding the hickey from your parents. If they pop into your room unexpectedly, you can quickly move your hair over the hickey., Hickeys will initially have a red color. A green concealer will counterbalance this color, causing the hickey's appearance to fade.Apply your concealer to the hickey. Do not be afraid to use a lot. More is better when it comes to covering a hickey. Use a concealer that matches your regular skin tone. Apply this over the green concealer with a makeup brush. Gently dab the area around the concealer using a makeup sponge until it blends gradually into your natural skin.

You'll be brushing ash and encrusted char off the grill at this location, so it should be far from walking paths.   Choosing a cleaning location far from walking paths will prevent ash and char from being tracked around your campsite or home.; , Take the grate out of the grill. The grate may stain your hands with ash and char. Prevent this from transferring to your skin with gloves. Brush the grate with a wire grill brush to remove buildup from the grate.         In most cases, you should be able to lift the grate out of the grill. Some grills may have slots the grate fits into or catches. Release the catches, if necessary, and slide the grill free. Use moderate force when brushing your grate and grill. Using excessive force may chip the coating on your grill, which could negatively impact its performance or void its warranty., Use your brush to clear out any encrusted bits on the bottom of the grill and its lid. If you notice peeling paint, remove this with a stiff bristle brush or putty knife. Wipe the exterior of the lid and body of the grill with a rag wet with soapy water.          If you’re using a public grill, you may want to place your hand in a plastic bag and sweep loose buildup into a separate plastic bag to be thrown away., The ash catcher is a receptacle on the bottom of the grill where ashes collect over time.

This should occur on the outside of the lane, opposite the direction you want to turn, and in the straight, just before the grade begins. You should immediately transition from slowing into accelerating into the turn. Higher torque engines have a tendency to spin out in the back tires, so depending on what kind of motor you've got, you may want to downshift more, accordingly. Listen to your bike and get a feel for its capabilities at speed before you try to push it. This section assumes racing road conditions and dry asphalt.  , As you approach the grade, countersteer away from the turn and lean toward it, at no more than 45 degrees on the angle. You shouldn't have to throw much weight, but you might need to adjust your body position slightly to maintain stability at higher speeds. , More aggressive turns such as those done by competitors on sports bikes may require riders to adjust their body positions, such that the torso is parallel to the bike on the right side, and dropped low beside the fuel tank. Position your head correctly. The helmet should be in a position near the right handlebar and the right leg cocked outward on the peg at about 45 degrees, with the ball of the foot on the peg and the heel up against the bike.  , As soon as you secure yourself in your lean, accelerate the motorcycle through the apex of the turn. Keep your lean angle as stable as possible and accelerate the bike up slowly throughout the turn. The gear you use will depend on many things, the style of the bike, the road conditions, the grade, and the speed that you're traveling. There's no one gear for turning fast. Maintain a stable lean throughout the apex of the turn, dragging your knee if necessary. The right knee may drag on the ground if properly equipped and the lean angle is aggressive enough, in competitive racing.  , As they exit the grade, racers will right themselves by countersteering back the other direction, into the direction of the turn which was just completed. This should allow you to pop up into a stable, upright position and throttle up. Shift your body back to a centered and low position on the bike for stability.  , Most of the time, you'll need to shift up immediately after a turn to continue accelerating at high speed, having drifted toward the outside edge of the track again.

Ask your doctor if this device is right for you. You may even ask them to demonstrate how to use it.While there are no known problems with using doppler devices at home, it is best to have these tests done by a medical professional. Even with a device, you may not be able to recognize problems with the baby’s heartbeat without medical training.While a doctor may be able to detect the heart rate as early as ten weeks, at-home doppler devices may not work until five months., Lift up your shirt to reveal your bare belly. Squeeze ultrasound gel onto your stomach along your pubic bone or lower abdomen. Use the wand of the doppler device (called a transducer probe) to spread the gel over your skin.Ultrasound gel often comes with the device, although you may be able to purchase it separately.  , You can guide the transducer probe around your pubic bone area. If you’re having difficulty finding the fetus, hold the wand at different angles. The fetus' heartbeat will sound like a strong, consistent pulse.Do not use the device for longer than ten minutes at a time. If you cannot find the heartbeat in that time, try again in a few days. It may be difficult to find the heartbeat using at-home devices. Visit a doctor for an external examination if you are concerned.  , Once you locate the heartbeat, the heart rate will appear on the electronic monitor of the device. The baby’s heart rate should be between 110 and 160 beats per minute (bpm). The heart rate can vary between 5 and 25 beats from minute to minute.If the fetus’ heart rate is between 160 and 180 bpm, they may have fetal tachycardia. Visit a doctor.If the heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm, you may have actually picked up on your own heart rate instead of the fetus’.The fetal heart rate is not an accurate measure of health. Complications can still happen, even if the heartbeat is normal. Do not delay getting medical attention if you suspect something is wrong., If you are concerned that there is a problem, visit a doctor immediately. The doctor can perform more tests to determine if there is an issue.If you have any abdominal pain, bleeding, dizziness, cramping, or discharge, see a doctor immediately, even if the fetus’ heart rate is normal.

If you are purposefully going for a retro look, definitely wear your flares with cropped tees. However, if your aim is to style flares in a more contemporary way, opt for shirts with a looser fit and longer length. Look for shirts that fall at approximately the hipbone. Highlight the silhouette of your flares by choosing t-shirts in fun colors and graphic elements.Wear a tee with a colorful geometric pattern with clean wash denim flares. Try a vintage band tee with classic denim flares and vintage sneakers.  , A fitted jacket or blazer that falls at hip length can take your flares from casual to office-ready. For a casual Friday setting, wear high-waisted denim flares in a dark rinse with a cropped jacket with angular lines. For an even dressier “power suit” look, wear trouser flares with a neutral-colored button-down shirt, a wide format belt and a dark navy or black straight-cut blazer.Blazers can create a weekend-casual vibe, as well. Wear a long blazer over a vintage rock band t-shirt and add a pair of platform sandals into the mix for an edgier look.  , Tunics are loose-fitting blouses that are typically made with soft, fluid materials. When you pair a loose-fitting tunic that falls at about mid-thigh with a pair of flares, you can highlight your overall silhouette and create the illusion of height. Shop for tunics in colorful styles and with interesting patterns for a flowy, feminine look. Floral patterns emphasize the feminine side of this look even more, but if you aren’t going for an overly girly look, opt for other types of patterns.Wear a vibrant tunic with a floral pattern with a pair of cropped flares and platform pumps for a feminine vibe. Choose a tunic in a bright, solid color to create a similar look with less emphasis on gender.  , Get a chic but casual look by wearing a pair of loose-fitting, well-worn flares with a half-tucked button-down or tunic shirt. To keep things simple, choose a shirt in a basic neutral, like white. Roll up the sleeves to the elbows, toss on a cross-body bag and step into a pair of flats for a nonchalant yet fashionable European look.In this scenario, faded and distressed denim flares are flattering and don’t create an overly retro vibe.

"[""if it's going well"", 'ask her out', 'set the mood', 'compliment her', 'try some light touches']",How to Hook Up with a Girl2," You can't hook up with her if you don't ask her out, can you? Tell the girl that you've had a great time talking to her and ask her if she wants to pick up the conversation over drinks and dinner some time. Or if you're forward and met her out at a club or a bar, just ask her to come back home with you, but remember that this may make you look like a player if you're just getting to know each other. But if all you want to do is hook up, then hey--ask her to come over.   If you really like the girl, then you should take her on a few dates first before you try to really hook up with her.  , Once you've got her alone -- whether it's later that same night or after a few dates -- you should set the mood before you try anything so she's feeling more romantic. If she's going back to your place, make sure everything is clean, that the lights are relatively dim, and that you have some provisions -- wine, cheese, chocolate, or other sexy snacks.   Be an absolute gentleman when she comes over. Take off and hang up her coat and ask her if she'd like something to drink or eat.  , You don't have to go overboard. Just tell her she looks great that night, that you love her earrings, or just say that you like spending time with her. Make her feel special before you even make a move.   Don't be insincere. Tell her something nice that's actually true. She'll be able to tell if you're just buttering her up with compliments to try to get her to hook up.  , If she seems receptive and you're sitting next to her, then you can try some light touches before you start kissing her. Put your arm around her, place your hand on her knee, or even squeeze her hand to let her know that you're into her. You can even gently stroke her hair or put your arm around her waist if you're feeling more forward.   See how she responds. If she's comfortable with your touches, then she'll move closer to you, smile, and will start putting her hands on you too. Once the light touches have done their trick, you can try to kiss her.

"['eat plant-based proteins', 'decrease the amount of carbohydrates you eat in a gradual manner', 'limit the amount of sugary foods that you eat', 'consume dairy products']",How to Be Atkins Diet and Gout Friendly1," The Atkins diet focuses heavily on consuming proteins. Unfortunately, many meat-based proteins can exacerbate gout, so striking a healthy balance between both diets will help to live the lifestyle you have chosen. In order to do this, stick to proteins that are plant-based. These foods will give you the protein that the Atkins diet demands, while limiting your consumption of uric acid to cater to your gout because plant-based proteins have low levels of purines. These proteins include:   Legumes like soybeans, lentils and garbanzo beans. Nuts and seeds like cashews, sesame seeds, and walnuts. Grains like quinoa and oatmeal. Vegetables like broccoli and spinach.; , While the Atkins diet says to limit your carbohydrate intake, having gout means that you should be eating complex carbohydrates. However, in this case you can try to stick to the Atkins diet. However, you should not cut all your carbs out immediately. Instead, reduce the amount of carbs you eat very slowly.Rather than going from eating one cup of rice to no rice at all, cut back your carbs by eating half a cup of rice, rather than a full cup. Slowly reducing your carbs will allow your kidneys to adjust to the changes you are making to your diet while still being able to excrete purines. Slowly decreasing the amount of carbs you eat may also help you to decrease your weight. This will be discussed further in the next section of this article.  , Both having gout and the Atkins diet require that you limit the number of sugary treats and sodas that you consume. The Atkins diet says to do this because those foods get stored in your body as fat, causing you to can weight. Having gout requires you to cut back on these foods because many of them contain uric acid.These foods include:   Candies and sweets. Sodas, juices from concentrate, and other soft drinks. Instead, drink natural fruit juices that do not have additives because they stimulate the production of less uric acid.  , Dairy products are thought to decrease the amount of uric acid contained in your blood, which is good for living a gout-friendly lifestyle. At the same time, most dairy products contain protein, which works in favor of the Atkins diet.Drink one to two glasses of milk regularly. You can also eat foods like yogurt and cheese.

"['avoid peeling your fruit', 'wash with water', 'fully chew your food to release nutrients', 'have fruit first thing in the morning', 'pair fruit with meat', 'note the best way to eat fruit']",How to Maximize the Benefits of Eating Fruit1," If you want to maximize the benefits of eating fruit, leave the peel on (unless it's inedible) to get more fiber and antioxidants than you would if you discarded the rind or peel before you ate it.Colorful skins often have the most concentrated amounts of nutrients in the fruit, meaning sometimes the peel is more healthy for you than the fruit itself. The antioxidants in apple peels may help prevent cancer.Apple peels also are a good source of pectin, a type of fiber that helps control blood sugar and can decrease your cholesterol.; , You should always wash your fruit before you eat it, especially if you're planning on eating the peel. However, it isn't necessary to use soap or special fruit washes to do it — rinsing under lukewarm water is sufficient.Plain water typically is enough to remove any dirt on the skin, as well as any pesticide residues that may be present. Some fruits, such as apples and tomatoes, have waxier skins. The wax is harmless and you don't need to worry about scrubbing it off before you eat.  , Chewing your fruits break down rigid plant cell walls, opening up the nutrients for your body and allowing you to absorb more nutrients.Cutting and mashing fruits has the same effect, but make sure you use a sharp knife and eat them soon after. A dull knife may lead to electrolyte leakage, and you risk loss of flavor, texture, and nutrients if you cute the fruit and don't eat it right away., To maximize the benefits of eating fruit, eat it for breakfast. Eating fruit on an empty stomach is a great way to get nutrients and fiber to start your day.For example, you might include blueberries in a bowl of oatmeal, or slice up some strawberries or bananas on top of your cold cereal. A fruit smoothie can be a faster option if you don't have a lot of time in the morning to sit down and eat breakfast. If you want a bagel or toast, you can spread fruit on top. However, you should check the labels of any fruit spread carefully and make sure there isn't any added sugar.  , Your body better absorbs iron (from meat and non-meat sources alike) when it is consumed along with vitamin C, which both helps release the mineral and blocks other compounds in food that inhibit iron absorption.Using citrus fruits to glaze meat is a great way to tenderize your meat and help you absorb the iron. Examples include lemon or orange chicken and orange glazed pork chops.  , While most fruits are best consumed raw, cooking certain fruits actually increases their nutritional value. For instance, heating tomatoes increases the bioavailability of lycopene, and beta carotene.",457,"['way', 'fruit', 'pair fruit', 'food', 'water', 'fruit first thing', 'meat', 'nutrients', 'morning']"

Leave it for about 10 minutes as the pastry shrinks. Then you can cut off excess..  , Line the pie tin with the pastry and bake. This helps prevent a soggy bottom on your pie. Make sure you prick the bottom with a fork and overlay the pastry with a sheet of greaseproof paper or baking parchment and dried peas or baking beans. This helps to keep the shape and also stop any rising. Set your oven to approx. Gas Mark 5.  , Place them in the pan and add water.

From the fact that design and material can change over time, taking a few minutes to learn about currency could save you money or even legal hassles.Recognize that looking at the security features of a bill, such as watermarks or raised areas, is usually enough to detect fakes without the aid of a device.Be aware that most countries or regions, such as the European Union, have series of bills in circulation issued after specific dates. Notes are often taken out of circulation as counterfeiting gets more sophisticated, but also because the average life span of notes varies.Check out resources such as the US Currency Education Program (CEP) or the European Central Bank to learn more about the design, legal status, and life cycle of bills, as well as how you can spot fakes.; , Most currencies come with different features that help identify them such as colors, seals and watermarks.However, there are often a few standard features that can guide your examination including:   Portraits or images Watermarks Colored or color-shifting ink Security thread or ribbon Serial numbers., Notes are often made of material other than paper. For example, US notes are made with a mixture of 25% linen and 75% cotton and European bills with cotton. In addition, bills may have randomly dispersed security fibers throughout the note.Be aware it may be difficult to detect some of these features with the naked eye and may require more in-depth analysis.   Run your finger along the note’s surface. Many currencies, including the dollar and Euro, have raised printing, which gives them their special texture., Most countries or currency unions have some type of image on their notes as a security measure.Check any notes you have for images, which may also include special features such as holograms.Research central bank sites for specific portrait information. For example, Benjamin Franklin appears on the $100 note and is slightly off center.In India, you’ll find Mahatma Ghandi on most notes., Most notes in circulation in world currencies were printed at a specific time and have a watermark to help authenticate them.The watermark is often visible from either side when the note is held up to a source of light.Put each side of the bill up to a window that has access to sunlight and make sure you can see the watermark on both sides before using it.Consider using other sources of light such as a UV-light or a lamp and use the same procedure to check for the watermark.  , Many bills used have colored or color-shifting ink and/ or holograms. Moving the bill back and forth can help verify that the note isn’t counterfeit.Look for the ink on the face of bills and recognize color-shifting ink and holograms by tilting the bill back and forth.If you can’t find this, the note may be counterfeit. Be aware that some smaller note denominations may not have the same security features as larger notes.  , Many countries, such as the United States, Thailand, and India, use security threads to further authenticate their bills.Using either a UV-light source or your naked eye, look for this marker to ensure your bill isn’t counterfeit.Look for clear or colored threads that are embedded in notes. In some cases, this feature may only be visible when held to light.Check with the state’s central bank to see if there are further special features with security threads. For example, threads in US dollars glow with the number of the denomination under UV-light., In addition to other features, many countries have bills that contain serial numbers, which help identify when and where it was made.Check for serial numbers—which may be a combination of letters and numbers—to help ensure the money is not counterfeit.Check with the central bank of any country you’re visiting for information on serial numbers. For example, the United States provides data on the serial numbers of dollars.You can similarly get this information from countries like Thailand and India as well as the European Union., Most countries or customs unions have central banks that provide information on their currency. If you are looking for information about elements such as specific placement of face or back plate numbers or even want to see up close examples of how to review standard authentication features, you can draw upon the resources that central banks or currency issuers provide., You can easily check for fake money by comparing two bills of the same denomination. Use or obtain an authentic bill from the bank and compare the various aspects of the bill that looks suspicious.   See if you can detect any differences between the notes by sight. Look at both sides of each bill. This may confirm your suspicion that you received counterfeit money. Place the authentic bill on top of the suspicious bill. Hold them up to the light, which may expose any differences between the notes. Make sure to report any counterfeit money and the person from who you received it to your local authorities.If you do not know the person who passed you the money, provide the authorities with any information you can that may help them apprehend the counterfeiter.",879,"['portraits', 'ink color shift', 'bills', 'bill', 'holograms', 'standard features', 'paper', 'watermark', 'security thread', 'use central bank resources', 'currency printing', 'serial numbers', 'ribbon']"

Review your company’s workplace rules (perhaps available from your human resources department, if applicable) regarding personal relationships. Seeing the ramifications of having a romance in the works place spelled out might be enough motivation for you to put an end to the crush.There may also be legal ramifications of having a workplace romance, depending on laws regulating sexual harassment in your area.; , This can be the case even if you only talk about the crush, and don’t act on it. Gossip can give you a reputation for being unprofessional, and it can also lower your productivity and workplace morale. If you are worried about these risks, it may be best to not discuss your crush at work or with coworkers outside of your workplace.  , Recognizing the risks of these can be enough to end your crush. Potential problems include:   Being rejected by your crush Lingering awkwardness if your crush does not reciprocate, or, if he or she does at first, but the relationship ultimately does not work outPressuring your crush to reciprocate if you are in a superior position in the workplace Loss of credibility among your coworkers, who may perceive you as acting unprofessionally or giving special treatment to your crush, It is possible that the relationship could work out long-term, but if it does not:   The relationship might succeed at first, but then fall apart. If the relationship does not succeed, or eventually falls apart, you will have to deal with seeing the crush at work, possibly being promoted, etc. This can create a great deal of stress. If the relationship does not work out, and you or the crush feels pressure to resign from your workplace, this will create many more problems.  , In addition to providing the support of a sympathetic ear, your friend might also have advice to give.   If you don’t feel comfortable talking to someone at your workplace about your crush, or if you are worried about workplace gossip spreading, you can talk to a non-work friend.  , If you have been working too much or avoiding social interaction outside of work, then make yourself set aside time to hang out with non-work friends or go and do some activities you enjoy. Look for opportunities to meet people outside of work, as this may take your interests away from your workplace crush.  , Crushes often hold our attention because we let it happen. If you turn your mind to other things, however, it will be easier to get over the crush and move on.   At work, focus your mind on your tasks, and having professional interactions with your coworkers. Even some things as simple as taking time to decorate your office, caring for a potted plant at your desk, or listening to your favorite music while you work can provide positive distractions from your crush. Outside of work, you can keep yourself from dwelling on your crush by focusing on other things you’ve been meaning to getting around to. Working out more at the gym, spending more time with a hobby, even cleaning your home (if you’ve been putting it off) can serve as positive distractions.  , A crush signifies attraction, but can also get wrapped up in the fantasy of what life would be like if you were to get together with your crush. Separating the fantasies from the feelings of attraction might help you put a crush into perspective.   Fantasy is past and future oriented. Reality is present oriented. Focus on the life you are living right this moment instead of the life you wish you had.  , If you are sure that you can keep your work life and love life separated, you might be able to deal with having a crush on a coworker by admitting the reality of your feelings while also declaring to yourself that you won’t act on them.   Sometimes, having a workplace crush can even be beneficial. For instance, it might make you dress better, work harder, or participate more in your company.  , Maybe it seems like you would love to act on a crush, but in reality, it is only that the crush is unavailable or forbidden that causes the allure. Perhaps you can get over your crush simply by reminding yourself that you are happy where you are in life now, and that acting on the crush wouldn’t really be a dream come true.  , If you are determined not to engage in workplace romance (to avoid jeopardizing your job, or for any other reason), then devise rules to deter any crushes you may have. For instance, you might decide to only interact with your crush when there are other people around, since this will help prevent you from stepping over your boundary.Oftentimes, setting boundaries makes it easier to get rid of stress and runaway emotions.  , Don’t expect to necessarily get over a crush immediately. Let yourself have enough time to work through your feelings, and decide how you want to move on. Don’t beat yourself up if it takes a little while to get over your crush.

Compare one eye with the other to see if one eye is worse. If both eyes are affected then the dog may appear to have narrow eyes.If the eye is really bothering your dog, he may even hold his eye shut to keep the lid from rubbing against the eyeball.; , Your dog's eye may sense a foreign object, so his eye will water as the eye tries to protect itself against irritation. It will keep watering, trying to flush out the dust and grit it believes is causing the problem.You might notice your dog's face is constantly damp or see reddish-brown stains on the fur beneath his eyes from the tears., If your Boxer's eye is irritated, he may swipe at his eye using a paw. He may also rub his face along the ground. This constant rubbing can lead to an eye infection, so look for yellow-green discharge.Understand that some Boxers with entropion don't rub their eyes. This is because they've become so used to the constant irritation, that they assume the feeling is normal., If there's extreme irritation and rubbing over the course of several months, the eye may start making scar tissue to protect the surface. This scar tissue looks milky and will start to take on a blue appearance as layers accumulate. When this happens, your dog won't be able to see through the tissue.   In less severe cases of irritation, your dog's eye might look red. This is because rubbing causes the white of the eye to become inflamed and red., Dogs with short-noses (brachycephalics) are at increased risk, because they have extra folds of skin on their faces. These can push on the eyelids and force them to roll inward.This puts Boxers at risk for entropion.   Be aware that the symptoms of entropion are similar to those of other conditions like conjunctivitis, trauma to the eye, a foreign body in the eye, and glaucoma. If you suspect an eye problem, get your Boxer checked by a vet who can confirm the diagnosis.  , The veterinarian will look carefully at your Boxer's eyes to check for symmetry. The vet will also measure the gap between the eyelids (known as the palpebral fissure). This thorough examination will check the internal and external structures of your dog's eyes.   To check the eyes, the vet uses a tool called an ophthalmoscope which can magnify the cornea, making it easy to see if eyelashes are rubbing against the surface of the eye., If the veterinarian suspects your Boxer has entropion, the vet may put away the ophthalmoscope and apply gentle pressure instead. Applying pressure while pulling the eyelid downward can help roll the eyelid out. If your dog really has entropion, this will adjust the eyelid into the correct position.   The vet can confirm the diagnosis by releasing pressure. If the eyelid rolls back into the eye, your dog has entropion.  , If your dog's eye is very sore, causing him to squint, the vet may put a few drops of local anesthetic into the eye. This will numb any discomfort and let the eyelid sit in its natural position.   If the eyelid sits normally once pain is gone, this means it's not true entropion. Instead, it may be caused by some other discomfort.  , The veterinarian will probably recommend surgery to treat entropion. A veterinary surgeon will remove a small bit of tissue from underneath the eyelid. This reduces the amount of tissue, helping the eyelid sit in a more normal position.Surgery for entropion is usually only performed on adult-size Boxers. Your Boxer may go through several small corrective surgeries. This prevents removing too much tissue from the eyelid.

Jumping toward your opponent, pressing B, then unleashing it on them is a great way to do it. NOTE!!! Falcon Punch is a very slow attack and if your opponent sees it coming can easily dodge it, or counter by hitting you. It is best used when your opponent is holding a box, or when they come drifting back after being knocked off the platform. Anther use of Falcon Punch can help save yourself while falling. When hit off the edge AND way up in the air, it can be advantageous to ""punch"" your way over instead of using valuable jumps. Its tricky, because the punches are slow, but if used right can be the difference in being KO'd or saving yourself.; , This move is called the Falcon Dive. Use it mostly when your opponent is falling, or is right above you. It will send them flying similar distances caused by a falcon punch. Be careful though, as they might counter it with a down kick. After you complete a Falcon Dive, it allows you to use the move once more. It's a jump reward for landing the move. It can also be more fun if you insert a comment such as, ""Come a little bit closer!"" when the move is completed. If they are human, this might demoralize your foe. However, we do not endorse any type of bullying. Remember to have constructive fun while playing.  , If there is an obstacle in your way, jump, and then use it. Follow it up with another attack once they get up. The only word of warning is to be careful when near the edge of a level. It goes a prescribed distance no matter if you go off the edge or not. Avoid Self Destructing by Falcon Kicking toward the interior of a level and staying away from the edges.  , If they have enough damage, they will be KO'd. However, a word of warning. Throws are a useful tool to changing the tempo of a fight, but they are not main attacks. Using throws as your main offense is a true sign of a beginner. As you gain experience you will see that combos and ""Hard A"" attacks are more efficient.  , They can be very helpful when your opponent has low damage. There are two types of ""A"" moves: Hard and Soft. Soft A moves do not cause as much damage nor do they hit your opponent as far as Hard A's, but they are quicker. Hard A's are generally your Kill Shots. They produce high damage and strong hits which send your opponent flying. to execute a Soft A point the analog stick in the direction you want to attack and then follow up with pressing A. For example, you can point the analog stick Up in a way that makes you not jump and repeatedly press A to do multiple Soft hits to rack up damage. Once your opponent is approaching 100% damage, execute a Hard A by directing the analog stick in the direction you wanna strike while pressing A at the same time. It takes timing and a more forceful analog movement, but if the direction and A are pressed at the same time, it should yield a Hard A attack.  , B moves are characterized as Special Moves. Unlike A Moves, B Moves only have 3 variations: Up+B, Down+B, and Neutral B. Note that there is no Horizontal B. Neutral B executes the attack in the direction you are facing. Usually Neutral B attacks are weaker yet faster attacks, but Captain Falcon, DK, and Samus have powerful Neutral B's which either charge or take time to develop.  , Constantly move around and make it hard for opponents to inflict damage on you. And, when you strike, just dive in and attack. It can be highly effective if you Dodge. Do this by pressing Z and then pointing the joy-stick to the right or left, depending on the direction that best suits the situation.  , Poke balls, hammers, beam swords, etc. can give you the upper edge, no matter what character you are. Once you get more advanced, Items become trivial and some might even call them ""cheap."" Use with discretion, and judge your competition beforehand. Set the rules to the match before you play and enjoy. The hammer is generally considered the ""cheapest"" way to kill. Never rely on items as your means of victory, because you will gain few friends and little respect. Item Hogs, as they are affectionately known, are people who spam Items. Spamming Items is a sign of a beginner player.  , When one of your enemies has been thrown or knocked off of the edge, it is the perfect time to Smash them to their doom. Once they have expended all of their jumps, position yourself above them in the air by jumping. Time your Down A right and you will Smash then to their DOOM. The timing is tricky and you do not want to use more than one jump to position yourself. If you miss, saving yourself can be an issue. With timing and practice the risk will be worth the reward, and your foes will be demoralized for sure.

It is safe to transport and hold an animal inside the covered Havahart trap for a few hours, as long as you continue to feed and water it. However, you should be prepared to transport the animal immediately to a vet or wildlife center upon trapping, or release the animal in a new area where food it eats and water are readily available (see Warnings about feral cats). Contact your local animal control agency beforehand if you're unsure of what to do after trapping. Ask them what will become of the animal after you trap it. (Generally, wild animals such as squirrels or raccoons can be relocated to a wildlife management area, but feral cats are often euthanized.) Make as many phone calls as you need so that you will have a plan for where to take the animal once it is caught. Also, never make plans to trap a mother animal, which will only guarantee a miserable and agonizing death for the babies.; , Many traps exist on the market that treat animals with varying degrees of kindness. Experts generally agree that Havahart models are the most successful at catching animals and are regarded as the most humane traps available. They are well crafted, strong, and feature blunt trapping arms so they do not harm the creature. They are also regarded as inexpensive and low maintenance. , You probably have a spot in mind as to where you would like to place your trap--where you have seen the animals. Consider the following when placing your trap:   Human traffic. Place the trap away from human traffic. Animals usually have certain areas in which they travel regularly, and they generally stay away from humans and locations they have recently been.  Pets. Place the trap away from pets. Keep your own pets inside and tell your neighbors to keep theirs inside over the time you have the trap set out. A family cat or dog is an animal too, and they probably will be attracted to a baited trap. This trap could be set off, perhaps capturing or injuring pets instead of the intended target. It's also possible that trapped animals could be injured or tortured by family cats or dogs. Houses. It is not a good idea to place the trap underneath a house or deck. You may forget about the trap, or it may be hard to retrieve a trap with an animal inside of it from underneath a house. Water. Often, animals stay close to water sources like springs, streams, rivers, and lakes. If you are having a hard time catching any animals, try locating a spot close to a water source. Watch for footprints in soft soil, and place traps along these routes in shaded, dark areas. Animal hot spots. Place a trap where you have seen animals congregate. If many squirrels regularly congregate in your backyard, then that is a good place to locate the trap.  , Peanut butter is a good choice for an unknown mammal. Try some of these bait suggestions if you are trying to trap one of these common pests:Squirrels - Cereal, grains, nuts (especially peanuts), sunflower seeds, shelled corn, apples, mixed peanut butter and oatmeal, popcorn Skunks - Canned fish (sardines), crisp bacon, cat food, bread crust coated with peanut butter Raccoons - Fresh or canned fish, honey or sugar covered vegetables, watermelon, sweet corn, cooked fatty meat, crisp bacon, Marshmallows   , Cock the arming bar and fill the collection plate with a tablespoon of bait. Follow the instructions that came with your purchase. Keep in mind that the trap needs to be placed on fairly level ground for it to arm properly.  , This covering will calm the trapped animal by providing a sense of protection from predators and thus prevent crying out and struggling, actions which could attract predators or cause it injury.  , It is unwise and inhumane to leave the animal trapped without attention for more than a short period of time. Do not leave the vicinity of the trap until the animal is caught - it may be the wrong animal or it may struggle despite the cover and hurt itself.

"['meditate', 'listen to music', 'practice yoga (or another calming physical activity)', 'chant', 'allow yourself to daydream']",How to Mentally Escape from Reality1," Meditation is a fantastic way to clear your mind and escape reality; it is traditionally used to make the mind calm and peaceful.Proper meditation enables you to take your mind into a calm space and put reality on hold.. The best part is that meditation can be done in the comfort of your own home (or even bed) and requires no prior training or monthly membership.   Choose a peaceful environment, preferably one without distractions. The temperature should be comfortable, it should be as quiet as possible, and you should be able to be alone for 30 minutes. Find a comfortable position. Many people like to lay on the floor with their bodies relaxed, their feet pointed outwards, and their palms facing upwards. There is no “right” position in which to meditate, so find a position in which it is comfortable for you to lie still. You can also try the lotus position. Close your eyes. This allows you to tune out anything that is going on around you. If necessary cover your eyes with a mask or a towel. If you are in a noisy place, it may help to wear earplugs. Think of nothing. Relax completely, let your mind go free. Be aware of your breathing. Don’t necessarily try to control your breath, but simply breathe and be aware of it.Expect good meditation to take practice. At first, it is almost inevitable that your mind will wander. However, with practice, you will be able to completely clear your mind during your period of meditation. When your mind does wander, bring your focus back to your breath.Consider using downloadable meditation programs. Simply go to Google or YouTube and search for “meditation.”; , Listening to music is a fantastic way to clear your mind and make a mental escape from reality. Music has been scientifically shown to affect many different areas of the brain, and it can actually help you achieve self-awareness and regulate your mood.It is also a commonly used tool to engage in escapism.   If you are unsure of what type or genre of music to listen to, you can try to listen to ambient music or binaural beats.For example, try Dr. Christopher Lloyd Clarke’s relaxation music or The Tranquil Harp: Improvisations for Relaxation, Meditation, Integration by Paul Baker.If you desire something different, try classical music, such as piano concertos, or listen to Gregorian chants. For something more lively, try listening to drum and bass music that has no lyrics.  , In addition to having physical benefits, yoga has mental and psychological benefits as well. It is an activity in which the participant focuses on breath and body instead of on the worries and stressors associated with reality.Yoga is a great way to have some personal time, clear your mind, temporarily escape your reality, and get a workout in as well.If you’ve never practiced yoga before, do a Google search to find a studio around you. Attend a class for beginners, and try to incorporate yoga into your routine. Many yoga studios will allow you to attend a trial class for free.  Talk to the instructor of your first yoga class. He or she may be able to make some recommendations for types of yoga that will help you with your goal of mentally escaping reality.   To make your own ‘yoga studio’ all you need is a yoga mat, water bottle, and a room that gives you space to lay out your mat. Pick up the necessary accessories from a local store, and ] on your own in the comfort of your own home. Keep in mind that you may not feel the sensation of escaping reality the first time you try yoga. It will take consistent practice to make yoga an activity that helps with your mental state.  , Chanting can be a powerful way to temporarily escape from reality. Performing chanting, or mantra meditation can allow you to mentally “remove” yourself from your mind, thereby mentally escaping reality.   Chanting inspires a “relaxation” response. This means that your heart rate, brain waves, and respiration will become slower.This physical response can actually make you feel like you are leaving reality behind. Chanting the mantra “Om” is said to be extremely calming to the mind, actually inciting the release of relaxing hormones.This is because the “Om” sound sends vibrations through your lips and palate and into the back of your throat.  , Daydreaming constitutes the ultimate mental escape from reality, but many of us don’t have the time to allow ourselves to drift into a daydream world. Daydreaming not only helps you mentally escape reality, but also plays an important role in allowing us to recognize our own potential, achieve a greater sense of identity and personal meaning, and enhance our self-control and creativity.Allow yourself to daydream when the external environment is undemanding.This can be while you’re running on a treadmill, sitting in a traffic jam, or ironing clothes. Let your mind truly wander. This means that you shouldn’t try to control your daydreams- there is no “right” or “wrong” daydream to have. Keep daydreaming. Studies show that we daydream less as we get older.However, this should not be so: daydreaming is the easiest way to mentally escape reality and requires nothing more than some time alone with your thoughts.

Carve out a portion of each day when you can participate in activities which make you laugh and feel happy, even if you can’t get school credit for them or put them on your college application. After all, time spent laughing doesn’t just cheer you up in the short-term: it also stimulates blood flow and oxygen levels, thus reducing physical and mental stress.If it feels like you can’t find a spare minute in the day, try to combine your recreational activities with things you have to do. For example, let yourself watch your favorite comedy while you run on the treadmill or make posters for your school club.  , Most people have a friend or two who stresses them out. Maybe they make every situation dramatic, or they demand tons of emotional energy from you, or they tend to say passive-aggressive things that make you feel insecure. Whatever the case, you can lower your stress levels significantly by cutting these people out of your life and spending time with those who make you happy, energized, and positive about life.If you know a friend makes you anxious or sad, but you don’t want to lose them entirely, try talking to them. Say something like, “I really value your friendship, but I get stressed out when you say mean things about our other friends. Could you tone it down so that we can continue to hang out in the future?”  , In general, it’s good to be busy. A full schedule helps you avoid boredom and fight depression, but it can also apply unhealthy amounts of stress on your life and mind. Ask yourself how many of your commitments make you feel good and rewarded, and if any of them seem to strain you more than the others. If one or more of your activities stress you out and keep you up at night, you should consider cutting them out of your life. This simplification will free up some time in your schedule to do something you love, as well as make you more productive and engaged in the activities you continue.This doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing negotiation. For example, if you feel your babysitting workload or volunteering is taking up too much time but you still love it in principle, consider reducing your weekly hours. Ask a coach, parent, or boss to help you tweak your schedule to make it more manageable and rewarding.  , It might seem that physical exertion will sap your energy and make you feel even more exhausted, but in fact regular physical exercise will energize your body, increase your stamina, and positively impact your mood. Aim to get at least twenty minutes of aerobic exercise—for example, jogging, brisk walking, or cycling—a day in order to release natural endorphins, improve performance and brain power, and boost your immune system.If you already spend a lot of your time shut up alone in your room doing homework or studying, consider taking up a group physical activity such as rowing or yoga. This will give you all the physical benefits of running or cycling while also providing a valuable social stimulus.  , According to recent studies, teenagers are one of the most sleep-deprived demographics in society. This lack of sleep both reflects heightened stress levels and causes them.Not only does this nine hour downtime allow your brain and body some precious time to unplug from daily worries, it also enhances your performance in school and sports while brightening your overall mood.Some concrete ways to improve sleep include being more active during the day, limiting caffeine intake, and removing distractions such as laptops and television in the bedroom.If you’re feeling sleepy in the middle of the afternoon, don’t assume you have to fight through the drowsiness. Instead, take a twenty-minute nap to recharge your energy reserves and freshen your perspective on the task at hand.",667,"['time', 'laugh', 'fun things', 'life', 'people', 'hours', 'regular physical exercise', 'sleep', 'night']"

Find a river with trout by looking at local and state parks. Pick a river where trout naturally appear or a river stocked with trout. Be aware that rivers with naturally reproducing trout populations sometimes have stricter tackle and bait restrictions.Get fishing bait. Check the bait restrictions wherever you plan to fish. Use one of the following: worms, crickets, grasshoppers, salon roe or corn kernels. Find a spot upstream to increase your chances of catching a trout. Look for an easily accessible clearing on the shoreline. Try to find a spot with slow moving patches of deep water or converging currents. Bait your hook and cast your rod.

When you're with your soul mate, he’s got your back and you’ve got his. You know that when times get tough, you’ll face them together. Do you tell each other your problems? Does he listen when you’re upset and let you know that he’s there to help if you need it? Do you do the same for him? When you need help does he do everything he can to help you? If you're with your soul mate, he’s not off with his friends while you build that new bookshelf alone. He’s right there next to you with a hammer. , When you're with your soul mate, you feel comfortable telling him things you wouldn’t tell other people, and he does so with you. You've seen each other’s vulnerable sides, and you’ve seen each other’s worst moments. You don’t worry that he’ll leave if he sees the real you, because he’s seen it—and he loves it. And you love him, too, flaws and all.   Do you feel comfortable telling him the things you’re ashamed or embarrassed of? Does he listen to you without judging? Does he open up to you? If you're soul mates, opening up should be easy because you're secure that you love and support each other, no matter what. , If you're with your soul mate, you should have plenty of similar interests. You don’t have to share every interest, but you should share at least some big ones. If you’re a major bookworm, your soul mate will probably enjoy reading, too. If you’re a nature-lover, your soul mate probably doesn’t hate being outside.   Don’t expect your soul mate to love everything that you do, or vice versa. You're both unique individuals, and that's part of why you love each other. But you should share at least a few major interests, and be willing to appreciate the rest. , Soul mates have a lot in common and support and listen to each other—but that doesn’t mean that they shy away from disagreements. If you're with your soul mate, you know that your love is stronger than any conflicts that arise between you. You both should feel comfortable facing your problems head on because you know that it makes your relationship stronger and helps you to be better people. Are you comfortable telling him when you think he’s wrong? Is he comfortable telling you? And when he calls you out, you should listen because you know that above all else, he supports you and wants you to be your best self. How do you argue? Soul mates don’t insult one another or hold onto ammunition from a fight they had six months ago. When you argue with your soul mate, it's with the goal of working out your problems and strengthening your relationship. The goal is never just winning the argument.  , Does he think you are interesting and exciting? Does he think your jokes are funny? Does he appreciate your intelligence? If you're with your soul mate, he should believe in you and encourage you to believe in yourself, and you should do the same for him.   This doesn’t mean you aren’t aware of each other’s flaws. But you should be able to accept those flaws as being part of what makes your partner who he is. , If you're soul mates you know more than just the big things; you also know the small details of each others’ daily lives, because you pay attention to each other and make each other a priority. Does he know how you like your eggs, or what your shoe size is? Do you know which train he takes to get home from work or which section of the newspaper he likes to read first?

"['get tested regularly', 'learn specific symptoms', 'get vaccinated', 'get treated', 'ask about high-risk sex']",How to Have Safer Sex2," Go to your doctor or a free clinic regularly to get screened for HIV and other STIs. Get tested together with a monogamous partner before deciding to stop using protection. You should continue to get tested regularly even when you are in a relationship, to be on the safe side. It is better to get tested than to unknowingly be infected with an STI.Ask your partner to go with you if you're nervous. It's not lame to request that your partner do this enthusiastically and willingly. If your partner doesn't want to go together, ask them to go on their own and share the results with you. You can try saying, ""I respect your need for privacy. But please remember that this effects both of our bodies and health. We need to share this information with each other."" If your partner is not willing to practice safe sex, find another partner., Educating yourself can help keep you safe. One of the best ways to protect yourself is to boost your knowledge. Take some time to learn about different STIs. You can learn about methods of contraction, and symptoms. Your doctor is one of your best resources. Ask your doctor for some information or look at a reputable website.For example, you should know that one of the most common STIs, chlamydia, often has no symptoms. For that reason, it is often unknowingly passed to others. Ask your doctor to test for all STIs before you sleep with a new partner. Genital warts are another common STI. These warts are easily spread by skin-to-skin contact. The flesh-colored bumps may look similar to cauliflower. Your doctor can help you find the best treatment plan. Many STIs don’t have visible symptoms; however, if you see any abnormalities on your partner’s genitalia, you should avoid having sex until they have visited the doctor. Know your body. If you notice any changes in your body, visible or not, don't hesitate to contact your doctor. You're always better safe than sorry.  , One of the best ways to prevent certain STIs is by getting vaccinated. There are currently vaccines that can be used to prevent hepatitis A and B, and human papillomavirus (HPV). Talk to your doctor about whether these vaccines are right for you.Females between the age of nine and 26 should be given the HPV vaccine. It is given in three doses over six months. The CDC states that this vaccine is safe for all women between those ages. The HPV vaccine is also recommended for boys, given at age 11 – 12 years The CDC recommends the Hepatitis A vaccine for all children, men who engage in intercourse with other men, and illegal drug users. There are many populations who should receive the Hepatitis B vaccine. These groups include:  Children under 19 who have not previously been vaccinated Intravenous drug users Men who have sex with men Individuals with HIV or chronic liver disease    , Part of having safe and responsible sex is making sure that you are not passing a disease to your partner. If you have contracted an STI, you need to make sure that you receive the proper medical treatment. If you receive a negative diagnosis, ask your doctor about the best treatment option for you.For example, maybe you learn that you have contracted gonorrhea. Your doctor will prescribe a course of antibiotics as a treatment. For this, and any infection, make sure to take the medicine exactly as instructed. Ask your doctor if you have any questions, or are concerned about side effects. Tell your partner. You need to say, ""I need you to know that I was recently tested for STIs. I have gonorrhea. You need to get tested as soon as possible.""  , You might find yourself in a situation where you want to knowingly engage in high-risk sex. For example, maybe your partner was previously diagnosed with HIV. Talk to your doctor before engaging in sexual activity.Ask a lot of questions. You can say, ""My partner is HIV-positive. What extra steps can we take to make sure that I remain negative?"" Keep the lines of communication open. If you or your partner have questions, make sure to ask. It is possible to have a healthy and happy sex life with someone who has tested positive. You just need to make sure that safety is always part of your routine.

Are they the crazy type? While you are in Middle school / Junior High you do not want to act like somebody you're not. If you're not generally the popular type, stop trying your luck in that big group of kids. Don't bother to pretend to be something your not or you will be wasting your time completely. The popular kids are usually not the nicest, but at the same time they are still reasonable people. If you're not the sporty type, don't bother joining that sports club just because it looks cool. Find something that suits you and friends who love you for who you are.; , It's perfectly fine to have friends and be nice with everyone but if you are ashamed of some of the things coming from their mouths maybe its time you find others that don't embarrass you to the point you could rip out all of your hair. In middle school squads are really important.  , You don't need to be trying too hard to be someone else's friend it will make you look desperate. While you're in school it's better to be yourself and have people accept you for who you are inside, even if you are loud and carefree! This might seem corny/ stupid, but I have been through middle school before. You should try to be everyone's friend and be as nice as possible (there's no point having fights just because you can) but don't try to buy the same clothes as someone thinking you're ""fitting in"". Really, you're just looking like a copy cat. If you have to change yourself to fit in with a certain group, change your circle of friends! Keep your secrets to yourself  , If you are mean to people others are intimidated and really want nothing to do with you and that's how it'll stay. You don't want yourself looking like the school bully and an awful person to be friends with. You want to be a really nice person and have both boy and girl friends.Never be the bad guy in a situation.  , If you notice someone if feeling sad, try to cheer them up because then you'll look like a nicer person and people will like you for it. if you help teachers you'll carry out a better reputation and then you'll be less likely to be blamed for any occurrence in the class.  , If you cuss just because you think its funny, its not. Actually cussing is highly unattractive and people won't want you to be at their houses in fear that their parents will hear you and then they'll get in trouble by their parents thinking they're in with the wrong crowd. If you don't usually swear, don't do it just to fit in. Some middle schools have drugs, but trust me STAY AWAY. Is being cool worth having an addiction?  , It's not about the most popular shoes, it's about what shoes you want. Individualism is hard to find in a middle school because people get made fun of for wearing things that others may not particularly like. This is why you'll see kids wearing name- brand clothes so that they'll fit in and look good. Yes, Wearing name brands are in style but are you wearing too much? Take a minute to examine your closet and see how many shirts have brand names like ""Aeropostale"" written across the front. You seem like a billboard wearing things with names written across the front as if advertising them. Try wearing things occasionally that don't have a name across it.  , No one likes a perv. So don't always pop sexual jokes out of nowhere. Don't say anything about rape or having sex with somebody, it really makes you look dumb. If you say something weird that would make someone else think you are stalking them a rumor may get spread and you may get a horrible reputation as the weirdo.  , Don't think for one minute that by having sex when you aren't ready, doing drugs, something illegal, or crude is going to make you popular because it won't. It'll really get you in serious trouble and possibly screw up your entire life. Having sex when you aren't ready(especially in school) could get you labeled as insecure or clingy and to top that off without protection you could be a mommy or daddy. And its really awful to hear a 13- 14 year- old getting pregnant, nobody would like that and it'd screw up job opportunities and other important things in life. Drugs could get you on parole and kicked out of school and really screw up your record. Try to stay clean throughout your school life, no matter how hard it can be sometimes.

"['find the study environment that works best for you', 'study with friends', 'make sure you have everything you need before you go somewhere to study', 'take advantage of technology', 'take breaks']",How to Remember to Turn in Homework4," While quiet, private places may be ideal for some people, human productivity varies for everyone in different settings. In fact, some people focus better with lots of people around and a bit of noise.   Try studying in different environments to find the one that allows you to focus the best. Avoid screens, especially TVs. This includes your phone. Put your phone in your bag and leave it there. Only check it during scheduled breaks.Wear headphones (or earplugs). Whether in a library or coffee shop, headphones will help reduce the frequency of auditory distractions. Choose music that does not have lyrics, and is more ambient than bass-driven. Think “background music” when you’re making your selection, but know that you can still listen to music you enjoy. If you’re studying at home, try to use a room in which you won’t be interrupted by family members or roommates. Let others know you intend to work on homework for a certain amount of time, and ask them to let you be.  , If you have another friend that needs to get work done – perhaps even the same assignment – work alongside one another. Working beside someone else may actually increase your ability to focus on your homework.   The company of a friend can keep you from wondering what everybody else is up to, and can even make doing your homework feel like hanging out. Avoid studying with friends who tend to interrupt a lot, or who have trouble focusing themselves. You can hang with whoever you want once your work is done!  , This includes your organizational materials, any textbooks or resources, and the equipment you’ll need to complete an assignment – even if it’s only a writing utensil and some paper or your computer and charger.   Include a healthy snack, as well as a water bottle. Not having to get up for sustenance will keep you grinding through your homework for a longer period of time. Don’t forget sticky notes. They’re weirdly helpful. Use them as visual reminders of important things to remember, and to keep pages in books you’re studying or otherwise referencing frequently.  , Computers have increased human productivity immensely. You can research, write, and edit much faster by using a computer. However, don’t allow all of the non-productive stuff you can do on a computer to distract you from your homework.   Computers can also help you organize. Familiarize yourself with web-based storage systems like Google Drive and Dropbox. These will allow you to save and access files from anywhere you have internet access.Use a flash drive too. Save all electronic files to both a web-based storage system and a thumbdrive. Keep the drive with you at all times. (Get a thumb drive with a keychain attachment!) This way, even if you forget your hard copy, you can print another at school and eliminate the unfortunate “I forgot my homework” scenario.  , When you sit down to work on homework, commit to working for a certain length of time, and schedule yourself a short break. This will keep you from getting overwhelmed or burnt out during long study days. It will also help keep your mind focused.   Try a 10 minute break after every 50 minutes of focused work.Use these breaks to go for a short walk, use the washroom, do a brief physical exercise (like stretching, push-ups, or jumping jacks), or to get a simple chore out of the way. Do not allow yourself to get distracted by activities that will prevent you from going back to work or will get your mind out of study mode. For instance, don’t call someone you haven’t spoken with in a while or sit down with friends who are hanging out but not studying. Reward yourself when completing assignments – but not before. If you’ve been itching for a bowl of ice cream, don’t dive into the freezer during a break. Instead, enjoy the ice cream once your homework is done for the evening and you can focus all of your attention – or none at all – on every bite.

Different types of skin respond better to different products.   A heavier, oil-based moisturizer generally works best for dry skin. You may even want to consider petroleum based products if your skin is cracking; however, if your skin tends to have other issues in addition to dryness you might want to consider adding a couple different types of moisturizer to your skin care regimen.If your skin is oily, making it prone to acne breakouts, try applying a lighter moisturizer to your face after washing. Areas that tend to be oily, such as the face or scalp, will not need the same treatments as other areas of the body.If your skin is easily irritated and you're prone to redness and rashes, ingredients like aloe and chamomile can help. These soothing components smooth over cracked, dry skin. You should also avoid anything containing fragrances and dyes.If you're older, an oil-based moisturizer is best as oil-producing glands in the body become less active.; , Dry skin may be related to underlying skin problems. You might want to see a dermatologist for a prescription cream if your skin dryness is accompanied by certain symptoms.   Eczema and psoriasis can lead to dry skin. If you have one of these conditions, you will also break out in scaly rashes and may frequently experience dead skin coming off in flakes.Sun exposure can cause dry skin. If you live in a sunny area, you should talk to a dermatologist on how to best prevent your skin from sun damage. Too much sunlight can cause certain cancers like melanoma so it's important you educate yourself on how to stay protected., If you're unsure about what kind of moisturizer works for your needs, as a doctor, pharmacists, dermatologist, or someone working at a health food or skin care store. Oftentimes, people are unsure what kind of products they need if their skin is dry in some places and oily in others or if they have certain conditions, like eczema, and are unsure if products could potentially make symptoms worse. If you're struggling with decision making, ask a professional for help., To start, you should read labels of any products you're looking for. Depending on your skin type, you should be on the lookout for different ingredients.   People with dry skin should look for heavier moisturizers. A moisturizer containing antioxidants, dimethicone, and grape seed oil or petrolatum, which prevent water loss from the skin, can be helpful.If you tend to have oily skin around your face, you can always use a water-based moisturizer on your face and an oil-based one on dry areas like knees, hands, and elbows. It should be labeled ""oil-free"" and list water as one of the first ingredients. Products containing retinols can cause your skin to dry out, so choose a gentle preparation and use it very sparingly at first — every other night at the most. Follow this with a moisturizer.  , Chances are, you'll have to try several brands before you find a moisturizer that works for you and your skin. It might be best to buy small bottles of a variety of products until you've settled on one you really like. See if any product you're curious about trying has travel-size or sample-size options, as this will prevent you from overspending or left with lotions you cannot use., Protecting your skin from the sun is important, especially if it's compromised by dryness or cracking. Look for a moisturizer that also includes sun protection. Many moisturizers also include sunscreen., The water in a hot shower removes certain oils from your skin. Always replenish these oils by applying your chosen moisturizer upon getting out of the shower, paying close attention to legs, knees, hands, and other areas susceptible to dryness.Use ointment and creams vs lotions. Use creams or ointments that contain olive oil or shea butter., You should apply the moisturizer as needed. You might need to use lotion after some of the following:Being exposed to cold weather After exercise After washing your hands  , In generally, heavier oil-based creams should not be used on your face unless you have excessive dryness. This can clog pores and lead to acne breakouts.",710,"['certain precautions', 'labels', 'underlying problems', 'day', 'shower', 'creams', 'moisturizer', 'help', 'skin type', 'sunscreen']"

Fill a large pot 3/4 full with water, and bring it to a boil. Add the potatoes and cook them for about five minutes, until a fork slides in easily when you poke a piece. Drain the water.; , Slice the cooked potatoes into small, pea-sized chunks, or use a potato masher to mash them into small bits. If the potatoes pieces are too large they may rip through the pastry puff.  , Bring a small pot of water to a boil and place the peas in the pot. Let them boil for about one minute, until the peas are tender (test one to be sure). Drain the water and reserve the peas.   If you're using frozen peas, simply thaw them by letting them sit at room temperature for one hour. If you're in a hurry, submerge the bag of peas in cold water for ten or fifteen minutes to thaw them.  , Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan. When the oil is hot enough to shimmer and slide easily through the pan, add the chopped onion. Sauté the onion for about five minutes, until it begins to brown.  , Put the curry powder, turmeric powder, chili powder, black pepper and salt in the pan with the diced onion. Stir the spices and the onion until the mixture is thoroughly incorporated.  , Stir them together with the onions and spices. Cook the mixture for two minutes, stirring constantly.  , Remove the pan from heat and set the mixture aside while you make the pastry., Use your hands or a pastry cutter to incorporate the shortening into the flour mixture.  , Mix together until the ingredients are well combined. If needed, add a little more water to ensure a good, smooth consistency. If the pastry seems too moist, adjust with a little more flour.  , Place the dough on a floured work surface and form it into a ball. Use the heels of your hands to push down on the dough, then turn the dough and push it again. Continue until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.  , Place it in a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside for a minimum of 30 minutes before rolling. Resting the dough will help the puffs become lighter and less dense, so don't skip this step., Remove the plastic and turn the dough back onto a floured work surface. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until it's 1/4-inch thick.  , Use a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass to cut circles about three inches in diameter from the dough. If you want larger puffs, cut larger circles; for miniature puffs, cut smaller circles.  , Spoon about one teaspoon of filling in the center of each circle. Brush the edges of the dough circle with a little water, then fold the circle in half over the filling. Use a fork to or your fingers to seal the edges together so the filling won't fall out.  , This will prevent them from drying out while you finish making the puffs and heating the oil. Keep them covered until you're ready to fry them.  , Pour frying oil into a large dutch oven or metal pot. If you have a high-sided frying pan, that will also work. Pour in enough oil to rise at least one inch up the sides of the pot or pan. Heat the oil until it reaches 365 °F (185 °C).   If you don't have a kitchen thermometer, you can tell the oil is ready by observing small bubbles forming strings from the bottom of the pan to the surface of the oil. Or test the oil by placing a small piece of dough in the pot. If it starts to fry and turn brown right away, the oil is ready. If it doesn't fry, keep heating the oil.  , Place four or five puffs in the pot. Don't crowd the puffs by trying to fry too many at a time, since this will cause them to cook unevenly. You may have to fry them in several batches.  , They should be ready in thirty seconds to a minute, depending on how many you're frying at once.  , Use a slotted or sieve spoon to drain off the oil as you lift the puffs from the pot.  , Let the puffs sit for a moment or two so the excess oil drips off and gets absorbed.  , Curry puffs are usually served with a dipping sauce such as yogurt and mint, fresh mint chutney, peach chutney or tamarind chutney.

"['define your objectives', 'follow a standard template for preparing a unit', 'survey your resources', 'study the state standards and become knowledgeable about the actual content/subject matter of your unit plan', 'list in sequential order the major concepts in outline form to be clear on what concepts you are planning to teach within a given time frame', 'plan and create your assessment tools', 'pick and choose the lessons', 'have benchmarks in place']",How to Write a Unit Plan2," Writing a clear goal for each lesson and activity will help focus the learning of your students and your teaching.   For example, if you're planning a history unit on the Great Depression, you may want students to understand 1) the root causes of the Great Depression; 2) the efforts taken by Herbert Hoover to address the Depression; 3) the accomplishments of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal; 4) challenges to the emerging New Deal order; and 5) the influence of World War II in ending the Depression. Use these five goals to plan lessons and activities that will meet these goals.  , Normally, these begin with objectives, but also include standards addressed, materials, lessons, assessments, resources, and accommodations for all learners in the classroom.   The templates provided at the end of this article may be useful for course planning.  , Take some time to review what resources are already available to you. Often, there are good resources already in use and taking the time to use a previous lesson or learning methodology will save a lot of time in the long run. Consult experienced fellow teachers; many times they will be willing to share plans and ideas.  , Forty-two states and the District of Columbia use the Common Core State Standards, with Alaska, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia retaining different systems.You will be held accountable for meeting these standards; clearly understanding how your unit addresses state standards will make it easier for you and your school to report on outcomes.  , This exercise will help you understand how much material you can realistically fit into a unit and how you should allocate your time. Remember to leave room for adjustment. You may find that in practice, a given concept takes more or less time to convey than anticipated.   If, for example, you have four weeks to address the five Great Depression unit goals outlined above, you may opt to begin with three lessons on the Depression's root causes and end with two focused upon the influence of World War II in ending the Depression. In between, you might allocate roughly a week to each of the other three goals, but leave a ""float"" day or two built into the schedule. Plan supplemental assignments for ""float"" days that, while enriching, are not required material for meeting state standards. You'll be well-prepared if you do need the lessons, but you'll retain the capacity to sacrifice this material in favor of spending an extra day on a key learning goal.  , After reviewing what resources you can pull from, creating a diversity of assessment tools to evaluate learning is next. Both formative and summative measures should be in place to ensure a broad evaluation of the objectives is met by all students.   Formative assessments monitor student learning to provide ongoing feedback. These tools help you understand how well students are grasping course material so you can make adjustments as you go. Formative assessments typically have little or no point value -- they are meant as a check for the instructor and not as an assessment of student performance.A formative assessment tool for our Great Depression example might be a request that students submit two key points gleaned from a lecture on the First Hundred Days of the New Deal. Summative assessments evaluate student learning and are typically given at the end of an instructional unit. These tools typically have high point value as they do gauge student performance.A summative assessment tool for our Great Depression example might be a research paper on a topic of the student's choosing.  , Given the time and the needs of your students, select what fits their learning styles and approaches that will garner their curiosity and interest. Variety will ensure that diverse needs are met.   Our unit on the Great Depression, for example, might mix periodic lectures with examination of primary source documents, conversations about images of the Dust Bowl, audio recordings of some of Franklin Roosevelt's ""Fireside Chats,"" and viewing of the film The Grapes of Wrath.   , Once the unit has begun, have benchmarks to maneuver through the unit. This will help keep you on track for time and ensure that learning objectives are being met.   Formative assessments can provide useful benchmarks. Plan points at which you will commit to move onto new material even if student understanding remains incomplete. Spending too much time on one segment of your unit sacrifices the others.

Try to throw the items to the side so you will not fall on them. Don't throw them with too much force, as you may injure someone. Don't worry about breaking fragile items, like your cell phone. If you are falling headfirst, items in your hand are likely to strike the ground anyway. Your own safety is a more important consideration.; , You should also turn your head towards the armpit you tuck your chin into. This will help keep you from striking the ground with your nose or mouth. Injuries to the nose and mouth are among the most common serious injuries resulting from a face-first fall. Tucking your chin will also naturally bring the stronger parts of your shoulder and back in line for a roll, should you choose to do one.  , It is a natural response to extend and ""lock"" your arms or legs during a fall. This should be avoided. Locked elbows and knees are much more likely to be damaged during a fall, since they will not ""give"" under the sudden impact of landing. Instead, allow your arms and legs to remain loose and bent as you fall. , It is far better to land on your buttocks or side than directly onto your arms and head. Turn your body in the same direction you have tucked your chin to further ensure your face doesn't hit the ground. Try to make this motion as fluid as possible, without twisting your back abruptly. If you can't turn on your side in time, you can still break your fall with your arms and hands.  , If you strike the ground with as broad a surface area as you can, you will be less likely to be injured. If you had time to turn your body, this means falling onto your buttocks or the fleshy part of your side, upper back and upper arm. , If you must fall on your arms and hands, remember to strike with as much surface area as possible. This means striking with both palms, as if you were falling into a pushup. Make sure your elbows are relaxed. Think of your arms like springs, which will allow your body to come to rest on the ground without striking it full force. Don't try to fully stop your fall with your arms. Just allow the force of your fall to bend your elbows as slowly as possible, lowering your body to the ground. If you can't land on your palms, try to land on your entire forearm. Don't land on your elbow, though, as it is more fragile and presents less surface area to the impact.  , It is common to hold your breath while falling, and this should be avoided. Your body will naturally try to expel the air from your lungs as you land, and you should allow this to happen. Breathing out will allow your body to ""give"" to the force of the impact, potentially reducing the strain on your bones. , Instead of trying to halt your forward movement, allow yourself to roll with it. This is easiest to accomplish if you land on your side, since you will naturally tend to roll like a barrel. If landing on your arms or shoulder, you can attempt an intentional forward roll by keeping your chin and forward shoulder tucked, and tucking your knees in. Here are some guidelines for attempting a forward roll.Try to roll over the shoulder opposite to the side where your chin is tucked. As you fall forward, roll over your shoulder on a diagonal line from your shoulder to your opposite hip. Come to rest on your buttocks and feet at the end of the roll. You should practice performing such a roll from a squatting position on a soft, stable surface before attempting it during an actual fall.  , If you feel a sharp, intense pain in a bone or joint, don't put any weight on it, and call for assistance right away. If you suspect you may be injured, call for emergency services, and ask the operator what you should do to avoid worsening your injury.

Someone has to pay the credit card companies, and if you make an official claim that it was not you who made the charges, they will search for the person who did. Do not make a claim of identity theft and pretend to be clueless about who did it. Not only is there still a chance that the thief will be found, but you may also be in legal trouble for withholding information and/or lying on affidavits.; , This will make it harder (not impossible) for the thief to open any new accounts in you name, but it will not prevent them from using accounts they already have access to. Placing a fraud alert is free and (without an official identity theft report) lasts for 90 days. You can request a fraud alert from just one credit bureau and it will automatically contact the other two so they can update their credit reports.   TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289 Equifax: 1-800-525-6285 Experian: 1-888-EXPERIAN  , After placing a fraud alert, you are entitled to one free credit report from each bureau. Specifically ask for them to show only the last four digits of your social security number on the reports.  , Reporting the card as lost will mean you get a new account number and new card so that the thief cannot use the old account number anymore. Make sure the thief does not have access to your mailbox when the new cards come in. If you are not sure you can secure your mailbox from the thief, get a P.O. Box and have all correspondence sent there.   Do not report the card(s) as stolen, because this will trigger investigation. If you want to preserve your credit rating, avoid closing accounts, as this can have a negative effect on your credit score.  , If you have any suspicion that the thief can access your accounts electronically (which, if they have your social security number, they can) log into all of them. Change your usernames, passwords, and security questions. Create a new e-mail address that the thief does not know about and make that the only e-mail address on all your accounts. Avoid the temptation to write this info down; if the thief finds your new login info, you could be back to square one.  , This will make it impossible for anyone who you do not already have an account with to apply for credit. It will also prevent you from doing anything which requires a credit check, such as buying a car or applying for a new apartment, unless you call each bureau and lift the freeze. In most states, you will have to pay each bureau to place a credit freeze, unless you provide documentation that you are a victim of identity theft (which you will not, because as discussed earlier you don't want an investigation launched). This is the most reliable way to prevent the thief from using credit in your name.   If you decide against a credit freeze, consider placing fraud alerts every 90 days or purchasing some kind of credit monitoring so you can be immediately alerted of any new credit activity in your name.

You want to be there for them in the immediate period of grief, but also as they face difficulties moving forward. Look over your schedule and try to determine a few times a week that are most convenient for you to make a quick phone call or send a fast email.It is a particularly good idea to check in with the bereaved over any holidays as these can be times of loneliness and negative feelings following a death. Try to walk a fine line between being there for the bereaved person and pestering them. And, some people simply wish to mourn without interacting with too many other people. Try to find out about their needs rather than imposing yourself on them. At the end of one conversation, you might get an idea for their wishes by saying, “I was thinking about calling you next week to see how everything is going then, will that be okay?”  , Some people suffer from physical loneliness following the death of a loved one. They simply miss having someone else around, who they trust, in their home. If you think this might be the case, you can offer to stay a few nights over at their place, especially until the funeral arrangements are made.Make this offer more enticing by offering to do something that they enjoy, such as spending an evening knitting or watching an action movie.  , Let them know that you are comfortable discussing the life and death of the deceased person. You can start by referring to the deceased by their name and then seeing if the bereaved person will follow suit. You can also talk about certain memories that you have and see if they will join in.You might say, “Remember how Samantha loved this movie so much? I always liked watching it with her.”  , It is quite possible that they will not want to discuss the deceased person with you. Instead, they may want to talk about more trivial matters, such as what movies you’ve seen recently. If the bereaved person tries to change the direction of the conversation or simply says, “I don’t want to discuss this right now,” then follow their wishes and move on to something else or end the conversation at that point.  , You don’t have to talk to provide comfort. It may be a good idea to simply sit next to the person or offer them a hug. You could also give them tissues if they are crying. Or, if you are comfortable with this, you could hold their hand or arm. This lets them know that you are there for them without being overbearing.  , Depending on the bereaved, they may want to do something beyond the funeral to remember the deceased. As time goes on, let them know that you are there to help and will attend as well. You can also offer suggestions, such as buying a brick from the deceased’s alma mater or donating to a particular cause., If you notice that the bereaved is not coping well with their loss, then you might suggest that they attend a bereavement support group. You can find a group in your area by searching online. Funeral homes or hospitals can often suggest groups as well. Make sure to offer to attend the group with the bereaved person, or they might take offense to your suggestion.This is a very touchy subject, so it is important to proceed carefully or you could offend the bereaved person. You might say, “I’ve heard about groups in the area that meet to talk about loved ones who have passed away. I don’t know if it is your type of thing, but I would be happy to go with you, if you’d like.”  ",639,"['lead', 'past', 'formal remembrance activities', 'bereaved person', 'offer silent comfort', 'presence', 'chance', 'support group', 'email']"

Some outdoor plants are sun-lovers, while others prefer more of the shade. If your plants are potted, move them to the right location depending on their species. If you are planting your plants in a garden, make sure they’re in a good spot or else relocate them to a better place which suits their needs.   You can look up the sun requirements for each plant by visiting a local nursery or checking online. When in doubt, move a plant to a location that gets six to eight hours of sunlight per day.  , Outdoor plants tend to be a bit hardier than indoor plants (because they typically have to be indigenous), but that doesn’t mean that they don’t need plenty of water. Set up an automatic sprinkler system if you can. Water small to medium plants on a daily basis. Water trees and shrubs once a week.          Adjust your watering schedule to the weather. Skip a watering session if you've had significant rainfall, and provide more water in hot weather. On the flip side, set up a drainage system if your garden plot seems to be flooding or having drainage problems. Many plants have different watering needs in different seasons. They may need much less water during a dormant winter state. If you’re not sure how much water your plants should be getting, look up their species online or visit a local nursery to ask.  , If your plants are looking a bit drab, they may not be getting the necessary nutrients from the soil. Visit a local nursery and see what plant food or fertilizer would be put to best use in your yard. You may add chicken manure or compost into the soil as a natural way to provide nutrients for your plants.          If you aren't sure about your soil quality, take a soil sample to an agricultural extension office or soil testing laboratory for testing. You can also purchase do it yourself soil testing kits.  , Weeding is a task few enjoy, but it is necessary in order to properly care for you plants and keep them looking healthy. Pull out all weeds from the roots, and check back on a regular basis to make sure they continue to stay away. It is important to weed regularly, as these unwanted plants can steal valuable nutrients and soil space that your plants need to be healthy.  , Although you may not want to cut back the size of your plants, it is important to cut off dead flowers and branches as well as sickly looking parts of your plants. Typically done after a growing season has finished, use a pair of garden shears to dead-head (cut off the brown flowers and leaves) your plants. If you feel you plants are getting too big, you can cut them back at this time as well.  , Nothing is worse than having a perfectly tended-to garden that gets destroyed by pesky bugs and slugs. Find an organic insecticide to use on your plants, or use predatory insects that eat the plant-eating bugs for an all-natural alternative.   For example, nematodes can be used to eat spider mites and ladybugs can be used to eat aphids - but neither will damage or consume your plants.To keep slugs and snails out of your garden, you can sprinkle crushed egg-shells around the perimeter.

Flat leaf parsley tends to have a slightly stronger flavor than that of curly-leaf parsley, but both types are relatively mild. You will also need to decide if you want to grow your parsley from seed, or if you will grow the plant from a start/potted version.; , Parsley works well in any garden or pot, as it doesn’t have strict growing conditions under which it thrives. Choose an area that gets at least partial sunlight, either in its own plot or between other garden plants. If you decide to pot your parsley, place it on a windowsill that gets morning sunlight, such as on an eastern-facing windowsill.  , Soil that is relatively loose, full of compost/nutrients, and has a pH level between 6 and 7 is perfect for parsley. Test the pH of the soil, and incorporate peat moss into it if the soil is too basic. To create the perfect soil mixture, mix 50% potting soil with 50% compost for nutrients. This will create a light and airy soil mixture that will make it easier for the small root-system of the parsley to attach itself to., Fill a large cup or bowl with warm (not hot) water. Add a splash of dish soap, and stir the mixture to help it to dissolve. Place all of your parsley seeds into the mixture and allow them to soak for one hour. The heat of the water and the dish soap will help to break down the notoriously tough outer casing of the parsley seeds, helping them to grow faster than they would without soaking.  , Using a small strainer, pour the soapy water out and run the seeds under lukewarm water. This should remove any traces of the soap, and prepare them for the next step. Fill a bowl with very warm water (near 105 degrees Fahrenheit) and place the seeds in the water. Leave these to soak overnight to continue the germination process.  , After 24 hours soaking in the water, remove the seeds with a strainer and lay them out on a piece of wax paper to dry. When they have been fully dried, they are ready to be planted.  , If you want to speed up your planting time even further, you can plant your parsley ahead of time in small containers and move them to their final destination after sprouting. 6-12 weeks prior to the last frost before Spring, plant your parsley seeds into small containers and water them daily. This should give them enough time to begin sprouting, increasing their time to full bloom when planted outdoors or in a larger pot., Wait until all possibility of frost has passed and sow the seeds directly in the garden if you did not start them indoors. Typically, the seeds should be planted at the very beginning of Spring, around March or April.  , Using a small trowel, make the rows in your garden approximately 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 cm) apart and long enough so that the seeds can be sewn in 3-inch intervals. The seeds/sprouts need only be covered with ½ inch of dirt, so these holes/rows need not be very deep., Transplant seedlings started indoors into your garden after the last frost and when the plants are at least 3-inches tall. Place the seeds so that each plant is at least 8 to 10 inches from the other plants, in rows that are 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart. This will give the parsley plenty of space to grow, which it will take full advantage of with the commencement of late Spring.  , Water your parsley deeply at least once a week to encourage the development of a long taproot. You may need to water more frequently during extremely hot and dry periods. If you’re planting your parsley in pots indoors, give them enough water so that the soil is just barely moist. Consider setting up a drip system if you’re unable to water the parsley regularly., Weeds can easily blend in with the parsley, but they take up valuable nutrients and block out sunlight. Mulch around the plants to help the soil retain its moisture and discourage weed growth. Further, pull any weeds on sight and dispose of them far away from your garden.  , Along the way, seedlings will need to be thinned out so that there is only one plant every 8 to 10 inches. Once the seeds start to develop into plants, go through with a pair of scissors and snip out some of the smaller or less healthy looking plants right down to the soil. If you want to transplant these seedlings to a different location, then you can carefully dig them up using a small spade., Fertilize the parsley once a month using a general purpose fertilizer to sustain production of the herb for the entire season. You can also add compost to the soil to help keep it full of nutrients, giving your parsley an extra boost.  , When the parsley sprouts out with sets of three leaves that are fully developed, it is ready to be picked. Harvest the parsley slowly throughout the season by cutting the outer stalks of the plants just above ground level to encourage additional growth. Harvesting the leaves from the top of the plant will reduce your yield., Use your stored parsley within a year for optimal flavor.

"['check which way your garden faces', 'look for frost-prone parts of the garden', 'check the materials or surfaces used in your garden', 'consider where you live', 'look to your garden soil', 'consider the air circulation within your garden', ""consider modifying your garden's microclimate to eliminate problems and to improve your garden""]",How to Work out Your Garden's Microclimate," If this isn't evident to you, look for the direction in which the sun rises and sets. Look for the shadows cast by neighbouring buildings and trees, plus your own house, and be especially interested in the shade conditions at the height of winter when you get the least sun.   In the northern hemisphere, plots facing south-west are always warmer in northern hemisphere countries like Britain than those facing north-east aspects, whereas in southern hemisphere countries like Australia, north-western areas can bake in the sun.; , If you live where frosts occur, it is worthwhile assessing the frost-prone areas of your garden, as there are bound to be some parts that are more at risk than others. This matters when determining where to plant frost-fragile and frost-hardy plants.   Look for frost pockets. These occur in depressions, dips, dells, downhill, lower valley areas, hollows, or where blockages occur, such as where there is a wall, hedge, or a building that stops the downhill movement of cold air and causes it to pool in one place.Avoid growing early flowering plants in frost pockets.If there are barriers such as fences or walls, small holes in them can help to allow the air to keep circulating rather than pooling and becoming frosty., Some materials or surfaces retain heat while other materials lose heat. A garden with lots of bricks will soak up heat and act like a storage heater. On the other hand, a sparse hedge will allow heat to escape, as will low or no fences.   Hedges can act as filters and walls can act as funnels. Few new plants establish well in a wind tunnel. Small areas of lawn can act as a cooling effect.Paving or concrete can act as a heat bank.Garden beds close to these will be warmer than garden beds next to soil or grass/lawn. Areas situated under eaves tend to be hot and dry or cool and dry, depending on the time of year.  , The urban heat effect impacts city gardens, making them several degrees warmer than gardens found in the surrounding countryside or small towns. As well as more heat, urban gardens experience more pollution and often more acidic rainfall. Building heat can radiate onto gardens in urban environments.  , Soil can impact the microclimate through how moist or dry it is; clay soil tends to hold more moisture than sandy soil, while loam soil makes moisture easily accessible to plants.Check other sources of water in the soil, such as local water like streams, local precipitation levels, etc. Adding compost and mulch to soil can increase its moisture-retention capacity.Does the water drain away or is it impeded by the soil texture or terrain? Is overhead foliage blocking precipitation from reaching the soil beneath? Is the soil sheltered or exposed? Is there an area where water never seems to drain? This can be ideal to turn into a bog garden.  , Where do prevailing winds come from? What kinds of protection could you use in those parts of the garden most affected by them?  , One you have worked out what the garden's microclimate is, you can work to change it. At the very least, choose plants that suit each microclimate best, create shelters where they're needed, and remove heat banks or frost-accumulating objects where possible. Improve soil condition to create better water penetration and retention. Walls, pergolas, hedges, fences, etc., can all be used to create more microclimates to your advantage.   A really good time to check for microclimate is after purchasing a new house or prior to landscaping, to give you the opportunity to make the most of your new or changed garden.

You will need dumbbells for this exercise. Choose a weight that is challenging but allows you to finish the circuit. Try five or 10 pounds to start.Start with your hands by your sides. Raise your arms up until they are at shoulder height. Keep your palms facing down with the weights parallel to the floor. In a controlled motion, squeeze your arms together in front of you until the two dumbbells are almost touching. Your arms should still be at the same height and your weights parallel to the floor. Sweep your arms back wide to your original position. Then lower your arms back to your sides. Do two sets with 10 to 15 reps each.; , The triceps press works your triceps muscles. The triceps are the muscles in the back of your arms. You need dumbbells for this move. Try three to five pounds.Start with your arms behind your head with your elbows pointed out. Your weights should be parallel to each other right behind your head. Extend your arms up towards the ceiling until the weights are parallel to the floor, palms facing out. As you press your arms overhead, lift up onto your toes. Lower back down as you lower your arms back into the wide position with your elbows pointed out. Make sure to keep your abs tight during this exercise. Do three sets of 15 reps.  , This move focuses on the biceps and triceps, but it also works your whole body. You have to engage your core as you bend over, and it provides some strength training for your glutes and legs. You need hand weights for this move. Try five or 10 pounds.Bend your knees slightly as you lean over at a 45 degree angle. Bend your arms at a 90 degree angle. Extend your arms all the way out until your arms are straight. Then, in a slow controlled movement, draw your arms back. Keep your arms close to your body so that your biceps are sliding against your ribs. When your arms are at a 90 degree angle again, pull them back a little more until you can’t anymore. Do three sets of 12 to 15 reps.  , Upper back flies target your upper back muscles. You can either do this on your knee or standing. You will need one hand weight for this exercise. Try five to 10 pounds.Start on your hands and knees. Straighten the opposite leg of the arm you will be doing the fly with. For example, if you hold the dumbbell in your right hand, straighten your left leg. Point your toes and rest them on the floor. The other leg should be bent. Brace yourself with the arm on the same side as your straight leg. Hold the dumbbell in the other arm. Draw your abs to your spine. Lift your arm out to the side, keeping your arm straight with your elbow soft. Raise your arm until your arm is at shoulder-height. Your palm should be down. In a slow and controlled manner, lower your arm back down to the floor. Complete the reps on one side before you switch to the next. If you prefer to do this exercise standing, bend slightly at the waist like in the bent-over row. Complete the same movement as you would on the floor. Do 15 reps on each arm for one set. Complete three sets.  , This exercise works the bicep, which is in the front of the arm. You will need two hand weights. Try five to 15 pounds. You want enough weight to feel challenged towards the end, but not too heavy to be unable to finish.Start standing with your feet shoulder width apart. Hold your hand weights in your hand by your side, your palms facing out. Slowly, curl your arms toward your chest. Keep your elbows by your side and don’t let them push outwards. As you curl, your knuckles and palms should be facing you. Once you get to the top, slowly lower down in a controlled motion. Do three sets of 15 reps.

The bait is positioned differently for each. Set the trap in a stable area.This trap entices the animal into the cage with food. There is a trip pan that will trigger the door shut when the animal steps on it.Place the bait behind the trigger plate in a 1-door trap. You don’t want the bait to be close to the trap walls or the raccoon might swipe the bait from outside the trap. Professionals like 1-door traps because it’s easier for large animals to enter them.In a 2-door trap, place the bait right behind the trigger or bury it under the trigger. Or you could hang it from the top of the trap. The trap should be at least 32-inches long.; , You want to put your trap in an area where a raccoon has already caused damage or, if you know where the raccoon lives, near its living spot.   You are most likely to find raccoons in covered areas. They like to nestle in places like attics, porches, woodpiles, tree hollows, and underneath structures. Secure the trap. The raccoon might try to knock the trap over. You can prevent this by securing your trap. To do this, put a brick or weight on the top of the trap.  , Hopefully, you won't need to kill the animal. A live cage trap is the most common approach. However there are some states that won’t let you trap and release a raccoon.Paw hold traps will clamp down on the animal’s paw by holding it. They have a small snapping clamp device. Once caught, the animal is usually killed by shooting it. Again, though, check your local laws. You could always hire a wildlife expert to find the most lawful, humane way to get rid of your raccoon nuisance.  , Raccoons will eat many things. They are known as eaters who choose food based on opportunity. There are a few things they like most, though.   Raccoons are drawn by foods that are high in fat or sugar. The best: sugary foods. Raccoons love them. The caution is that these foods could attracted other wildlife, so use such foods within a live raccoon trap.  , Some foods that raccoons like are marshmallows, watermelon, sweet corn, and bacon.   In fact, some trappers say marshmallows draw raccoons the best of all! Raccoons also are drawn to wet cat food, fish in a can, bacon, and cooked fatty meat, like chicken legs., Once you’ve chosen the bait, you have to place it correctly in the trap itself. Change bait every two days for the best results. You could also set multiple traps.   You want to make sure the raccoon enters the trap completely, including its full body and tail. So place the bait far enough back to entice the raccoon to do this. You want to place the bait so the raccoon will step on the trigger. In a trap, this means the raccoon will step on the metal plate.  , Drop a trail of bait that leads right up to your trap to increase the chances the raccoon will enter your trap.   Make sure you wear gloves when you apply the bait because raccoons can sense human scent. In fact, it’s a good idea to use the gloves whenever you handle the trap, including once you catch the raccoon.  , You need to check your raccoon trap on a regular basis. It’s wrong to leave any animal trapped for a long time.   You might catch a raccoon in a few minutes. Or it could take a couple of days. The trapped animal is going to be scared and frightened. It’s more humane to not leave it for days on end in a trap.  , Now you’ve caught the raccoon. What do you do next? The humane approach is to relocate the animal. But this could be illegal in your state. Check with your local government.   Speak softly to the raccoon as you approach. Be gentle. This will calm the animal. Drape a cloth over the trap to instill further calm. Hold the cage away from your body. Wear heavy gloves. When relocating the raccoon, take it at least 5 miles away from your property, and release it. Be cautious. Raccoons can be dangerous. Consult an animal professional if you’re at all unsure.  , You will want to rid your property of the lures that attracted the raccoon in the first place.   Raccoons are drawn to garbage, so remove it frequently. Wash your garbage cans. Eliminate all food and water sources for a raccoon. Put tight-fitting lids on your garbage cans. Fix broken vents and screens. Close windows. Close gates and eliminate gaps in fences. Raccoons sometimes enter homes through fireplaces.

You can even make a reading nook in your room. Constant distractions from the book in front of you can make it hard to concentrate, and no one likes reading the same passages over and over. Finding the proper environment in which to read can be just as important as finding the right book for many people.Sometimes, people may suffer from light sensitivity, which can cause headaches when you read. Avoid high-contrast print, glossy paper, and fluorescent lighting.You don’t have to read only at home, either. Check out the coffee shops, cafes, or bars in your area.  , Try to set aside time to read every day. Even if it just starts as ten minutes on a lunch break, twenty minutes on the bus, and fifteen minutes before bed at night, that’s suddenly forty-five minutes that day you’ve spent reading.You can even turn this into a little game with yourself. Set a daily goal for reading time and give yourself a reward when you hit it. Eventually, you may come to find reading is its own reward.  , You never know when you might find a few extra minutes to read.

By having a list handy, you’ll always remember what books sounded interesting.   If you’re at the library or bookstore and see a book that intrigues you, snap a photo of the cover. That way, you’ll remember it for later.  , When you find an author whose style you love, try tracking down his or her other books. Even if the plot or subject of the author’s other books doesn't necessarily grab you, loving a particular writing style can lead to enjoyment of books you might not expect. Try looking into the other books of an author you find yourself really enjoying.  , Look into book clubs or reading groups that specialize in the books you enjoy. Reading can be more of a solo activity than watching movies or television shows, but it doesn’t have to be. Books can be just as fun to talk about with others as other media.Finding these groups locally isn’t always easy, so remember to look online for reading communities as well.  , Sometimes school, work, or other obligations might not leave you as much time to read as you’d like.

In a nutshell, some people are just born pessimists.   Thanks to your genes, you are predisposed to focus on threats, and lack confidence to deal with them. You develop coping styles that rely heavily on avoidance and other defense mechanisms. You work harder to manage your pain than to fix the problems. You tend to think that the world is unjust and uncontrollable, and that things turn out for the worst.Knowing this can help you stop trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, so to speak. With all the emphasis on happiness, your life might be more functional knowing that you're miserable by default, and that nothing is unusual or dysfunctional about that.; , In order to be functional, it's good to become familiar with ways to move around on the spectrum of misery and happiness. There are three clinically-proven methods to move negative affective predispositions toward the positive end of the spectrum; either avoid these methods completely or use just enough of them so that your productive misery doesn't kill you:   Meditation,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,Medication (mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)., Work as hard as you want, accumulate all stuff that you want, and get fabulously famous. This will raise your expectations, you will keep wanting more, and be no better off than you were before., Those who think that money can't buy happiness just don't know where to shop.Buy things that make you happy. Preferably, ostentatiously expensive things, like a Gucci Soft Stirrup Crocodile Shoulder Bag, Shipwrecked 1907 Heidsieck (if you can't afford that, Cristal works too), Nike Air Force 1 sneakers or, if you are a revolutionary, the Nike Ajax surface-to-air-missile. Unlike spending on unforgettable experiences with family and friends, spending on ""stuff"" won't keep you happy for too long. This is the ""adaptation principle"" at work., Humans never fully adapt to noise, especially if it is variable or intermittent.It is guaranteed to increase your stress. Move to a busy intersection, if you can.  , People don't fully adapt to long commutes, particularly if these involve driving in heavy traffic. Even after years of commuting, those who deal with heavy traffic arrive at work and home with higher levels of stress hormones.Bonus points if you have long traffic-ridden commutes because you bought a big house in an expensive neighborhood far away from work. Although people don't adapt to traffic, they quickly adapt to having more space., A sense of control is one of the most effective ways to increase your sense of engagement, energy, and happiness.You may need to assert some control to produce your painting, novel, music, or revolution, but try not to assert more control than is absolutely necessary.  , Misguided attempts by schools, self-help gurus, and the popular press to raise self-esteem in children have fostered narcissism, and other dark sides of high self-esteem.The popular obsession with ""Beauty"" has led to disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. But although attractive people are not generally happier than unattractive ones, some improvements in a person's appearance do lead to lasting increases in happiness.So if you don't think highly of yourself, or of how you look, you're exactly where you need to be. , This is the big one.The strength and number of your relationships trump all other factors in your pursuit of misery.Bad relationships make people miserable, and miserable people attract bad relationships(misery does, in fact, love company). People never adapt to personal conflict.You can count on that bullying patron, editor, lead vocalist, grim-and-determined comrade, or spouse to constantly add to your misery, even when they are not physically present (just ruminate on the conflict).

"['do not scratch or pick at your tattoo', 'avoid soaking the tattoo', 'do not expose your new tattoo to direct sunlight', 'avoid tight-fitting clothes', 'avoid working out', 'avoid swelling']",How to Care for a New Tattoo2," As it heals, your tattoo will begin to scab. This is normal, and the scabs should be allowed to dry out and fall off by themselves. Do not try to help the process along by picking at the scabs. This may cause the scabs to fall off prematurely, leaving holes or light spots on your tattoo.   If your hands or nails are unclean; you may also cause the tattoo to become infected. You should always wash your hands with anti-bacterial soap before touching your tattoo, and you should never allow anyone else to touch it while it heals.Dry, scabbing or peeling skin can become very itchy, but scratching at your tattoo may also cause scabs to fall off. You can relieve itching by slapping the tattoo with the flat of your hand, or by rubbing in a little lotion.Keep using moisturizing ointment to combat itchiness if it is a problem.  , Until your tattoo is fully healed, you should avoid swimming in a pool, in the sea, or even soaking in the bathtub. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, exposing your tattoo to too much water may draw ink out of your skin and damage the tattoos appearance. Secondly, the water in swimming pools, the sea, and the bathtub may be carrying dirt, bacteria, chemicals and other impurities that could cause your tattoo to become infected.It will be completely safe to resume these activities once your tattoo is healed, but for now you should stick to rinsing your tattoo in the sink or shower. Keep your showers and baths short, under 5-6 minutes.  , Sunlight is the worst enemy of new tattoos. The harsh rays of the sun may cause your skin to blister and bleach some of the colors from your tattoo. For this reason, it is best to keep your tattoo covered and away from the sun for at least 3 to 4 weeks, until the initial healing is complete.After that, you will still need to protect your tattoo by wearing a minimum of SPF 30. This will prevent your tattoo from fading in the sun, keeping the colors true for longer.  , Avoid wearing tight or restrictive clothing on the area with your new tattoo, especially at first. As your tattoo heals, it will seep plasma and excess ink, which may cause the clothing to stick to the tattoo. The clothing will then be painful to remove and may rip off any freshly formed scabs.If your clothing does stick to your tattoo, do not pull! First wet the area with water, which should loosen the clothing to where it can be removed without damaging your tattoo. In addition, tight clothing will prevent enough oxygen from getting to your tattoo, and oxygen is essential for the healing process. Aim to wear clean, loose-fitting clothing, day, and night, while your tattoo is healing.  , Tattoos that cover large surface areas, or are near joints (such as elbows and knees), may take longer to heal if the skin is forced to move around too much during intense workouts or other physical activity. The movement will cause the skin to crack and become irritated, prolonging the tattoos healing process. For this reason, you should avoid unnecessary workouts for at least a few days after getting a new tattoo.If you're involved in a self-defense class like karate or kickboxing, you may want to warn your classmates so they can avoid hitting you in the wrong place. If you work in a job that involves physical activity, such as construction or dance, you may want to consider having your new tattoo done on a Friday, so it will have the whole weekend to heal before your go back to work.  , Swelling may occur with new tattoos on your feet, ankles or calves, especially if you have been standing for long periods of time. If this happens, you can reduce swelling by taking an Ibuprofen, applying an ice pack to the swollen area, and elevating your feet and legs.

"['understand the purpose of massage oils', 'learn about the best oils', 'select the oil suited to your needs and budget', 'consider other base oils', 'understand the difference between base massage oils and aromatherapy essential oils', 'try the most popular aromatherapy oils']",How to Understand Massage Oils," The main purpose of massage oils is to lubricate the skin to reduce friction while performing a massage. This helps give a smooth glide and easy workability to the skin surface. Some of the secondary benefits include nourishing the skin and acting as a ""base"", or ""carrier"" oil for aromatherapy essential oils.; , The different attributes we can compare are how the oil spreads, how easily it is absorbed, its nourishing and moisturizing properties and the smell. Other factors to consider are the cost, the ease of cleaning, and the way it is processed. Generally speaking, the best oil will be extra virgin cold pressed, as this process maintains the highest level of purity while retaining most of the natural nutrients.  , There are several basic oils that are most popular for massage:    Almond oil: probably the most widely used massage oil is sweet almond oil. It spreads easily, and is very nourishing to the skin. It also serves as an excellent carrier oil because the smell is not too overpowering. It can be found in most health food stores and body shops, and is reasonably priced.  Grapeseed oil: Another popular oil is grape seed. It is easily absorbed by the skin but does not leave a “greasy” feeling after application. It is not as common as sweet almond and is usually a bit more expensive.  Sunflower oil: Sunflower oil is a low cost alternative and can usually be found at your local grocery store. It spreads easily and is a good carrier oil, but can feel a little greasy afterwards. Another thing to consider is that the majority of sunflower oils are heat pressed and have a very short shelf life.  , Other base oils have certain properties that can help specific conditions like dry skin, premature aging or eczema. These can be added in varying proportions to the primary oil and some examples include olive oil, wheat germ, and jojoba.  , Aromatherapy essential oils differ from the base oils in several ways.   These are highly concentrated “essences” derived from various plant and fruit sources which have profound effects on the systems of the body.  , There many essential oils to choose from, each with specific properties that affect the body differently. Here are some of the most popular oils whose effects are beneficial to massage and relaxation:    Lavender oil: Lavender is probably the most well known and widely used of all the essential oils. Not only does it have a calming effect on the mind, it is also an antiseptic and is one of the two oils that you can apply directly to the skin in cases of burns or stings to ease the pain. You can find lavender oil in almost any health food store, as well in many cosmetic shops and other skin care centres.  Ylang Ylang: Ylang Ylang might possibly be the most useful essential oil for doing massage. Its properties include a sedating effect on the nervous system which helps with relaxation, while stimulating blood circulation and the production of endorphins, the body's natural pain killers. It is also perfect for all skin types as it helps dry skin conditions as well as oily skin and acne.  Tea tree oil: Tea tree oil is the only other essential oil you can apply undiluted to areas of the skin as an antiseptic as well as an anti-inflammatory. When used in massage, it helps promote healing to damaged skin while supporting healthy functioning of the respiratory system.  Eucalyptus oil: Finally, eucalyptus oil is also one of the more commonly used essential oils for massage because of its anti inflammatory properties that help treat muscle cramps, spasms and sprains. It also helps with skin problems and even has the ability to prevent and heal scar tissue. Add all this to its ability to help open blocked nasal passages and stimulate the senses, and you have a versatile oil that helps on many levels.

Once you’ve determined he’s gay and available you can look for certain signals. Be on the lookout for these signs if he:   Compliments you. Tries to impress you in some way. Casually touches you. Opens up about his personal life. Invites you into his plans.  , Before becoming involved with someone, you have to go through a dance of sorts with them. There are many steps you'll probably go through before you both are honest to each other about your feelings.   This happens for almost every relationship., This cannot be stressed enough. Even if he is putting out signs that he may like you, hold off a bit. That just may be his natural tendency. You want to be able to feel out the situation before becoming committed.   If you think he likes you, your gut is probably right. You can tell by the way he looks at you. Eye contact is the best indicator for attraction. Other things you could look for is if the guy gives you a lot of attention in real life, flirts on social media by posting a lot onto your Facebook, or simply calls or texts you out of the blue.  , Try not to hang around him all the time. Sometimes it can be hard to read someone you like. You don't want him to think that you are dependent on him or that you are desperate. Play it casual at first and only shower him with attention when on a date.   After a while, you'll get really comfortable around him. Whatever you do, don't make him your ""best-friend-in-the-world!"" You're not looking for that kind of relationship., Go for a walk, or go to the movies. You don't have to do this every weekend, but do it at least every other weekend. Again, if you feel you're being ""clingy"", lay off for a while. Don't stop being his friend, unless you don't like him.If you do lose feelings for him, tell him straight up instead of toying with his heart.  , If you are confident that he likes you, go to a neutral place where you can talk like a coffee shop. Be honest to him about your feelings. Tell him what you want out of the future. Try saying something like:   ”I know we’ve been hanging out for awhile now, and I wanted to tell you that I like you.” ”After getting to know you the last couple of weeks, I’ve begun developing feelings for you” ”Stevie, I like you and was wondering if you’d like to take our relationship further.”  , When asking him out, don't get too nervous. If you do, try to hide it. It is natural to get nervous, and it shouldn't matter if you are. He is probably as nervous as you are.  , It can go in two ways, but regardless you should be proud of yourself. Making it this far is not easy for everyone to do.   If he says yes, celebrate! You guys are now free to be in a loving relationship that you will cherish. If he says no, don't sulk. Try to initiate a conversation about how you want to be friends. You could be honest and ask him if he still wants to be friends. Don’t feel like you have to tiptoe around the truth. This is the time to lay everything out on the table.  , Not everything in a relationship is drama! Laugh at yourselves when something is funny, and joke around with each other. This will bring your relationship to another level.  ",607,"['space', 'dates', 'predating game', 'relationship conversation', 'calm', 'decision', 'fun']"

Borrow a friend's computer and visit your neighbor's computer too, to see what is happening elsewhere.; , Calculate the time it takes to load completely. If it takes more than 5 seconds, continue with the below steps. If not, your blog has a good speed already and you're good to carry on as usual.  , A good web host is worth the money spent. You will have a better loading time and good access to help if there are any problems. Research your hosting provider. Do a bit of research on different hosting companies and learn about their response time and customer support before you make your choice or shift to a new one.  , A WordPress website sometimes takes more time to load because of its template. The template could have lots of graphics or bulky code that make it heavy. Choose a simple theme instead if you are experiencing slow loading. Select a theme with a built-in portfolio functionality.   A theme should display and style your content, whereas a plugin can be used to add functionality. Instead of going for premium themes, such as ThemeForest and Mojo themes, start with a free default WordPress theme and add features and styles along the way as you discover a need for them. Show only around four to five posts on the home page.  , A caching plugin can reduce a WordPress database call and makes WordPress faster. Use W3TC or WP super cache. However, do watch your plugin usage. Delete the plugins you do not require, as every badly coded plugin (even a deactivated one) poses a security threat. Select only the plugins you need and regularly update them.   While using cache plugins can speed up your WordPress, spend some time figuring out what’s working and what’s not. The most popular ones are WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache. Do not enable everything. Do it just for the basic things, such as page cache, browser cache, minimize, or try enabling the CDN option.  , Uncompressed and non-optimized images can massively slow down websites. You can avoid this by: Optimizing your images before you upload them & crop them. Use Wp Smush.it., it is a plugin that compresses your images   Avoid image based advertisements. Advertisements can be text, image, or java-script based. Go for the text or link option to prevent slow loading ads. If you are still keen on using images, see if you can host them yourself. Host videos externally. Host videos on Youtube or any video hosting provider to remove strain from your server.  , Create a backup. If you use WordPress products created with WordPress – updating your WordPress installation, WordPress theme, and plugins can be effortless. Every update brings better performance and functionality improvements with it.  , Keep the site as clean as possible so that it runs well. Some of the things you might try include:   Optimize your data base to remove junk from it. Use the WP optimize plugin for automating this task. Validate your page and remove any unwanted JavaScript. Adding expire header in blog makes no refresh a static component, which saves precious bandwidth. Consider using minified resources for making less http calls.

Canola oil works well. You may also choose olive or coconut oil. However, olive and coconut oils have lower boiling points than canola oil. Choose your base depending on your application.   If your final dish's recipe calls for a particular type of oil, you may consider that or a reliable substitute as an appropriate oil base.; , You want to start with dry marijuana. You may choose to stick with only the flowers. Some people will use all parts of the plant.Keep in mind that you will want to strain your oil later. Try not to grind your pot so finely that it will go through your strainer. A coffee grinder or food processor will work well. Just don't turn your marijuana into powder.  , The strength of your cannabis cooking oil will vary by your mixture. Pour your oil into a slow cooker, double boiler, or saucepan. Add your ground marijuana and stir. Make sure all your marijuana is covered in oil.   If you don't know what mixture will work, start with a mixture of two parts oil to one part marijuana by volume. For example, mix 2 cups of oil with 1 cup of ground marijuana or 100 millilitres of oil to 50 millilitres of marijuana.  , How much you are cooking will also impact your cooking method. The goal is to get your oil and pot mixture hot without scorching. Stir the mixture frequently. You can add a little water to the mix to avoid scorching.   If using a slow cooker, cook the mixture on low for at least 6 hours. You may extend that to three days for a better infusion. If using a double boiler, cook on low for 6-8 hours. Eight hours will give you a better infusion. Stir occasionally and keep a close eye on your water level. Don't let your double boiler go dry. If using a saucepan, cook on low for no less than 3 hours. Stir frequently to avoid scorching. This method will be most susceptible to scorching.  , You can strain the oil using a wire strainer to remove the larger pieces of marijuana. If you still have solids you want to get rid of, strain a second time through a coffee strainer. This will take a lot of time so be careful and patient. You may want to do small batches while you continue to simmer the mixture.   Alternately, you can do your straining through cheesecloth. Use multiple layers for more filtration. Put your cheesecloth over the top of a large mixing bowl. Secure the sides with a rubber band. Pour the mixture into the bowl. If you can get cheesecloth, this method is often preferred because you can filter more at a time than you can with a coffee strainer. If you only have small coffee filters, try using a rubber band for protection. Find a tall glass and place the coffee strainer on top. Cup the top a little into the glass. Use a rubber band around the top of the glass and over the edges of the filter to hold the filter in place. If you use a glass container to pour your hot oil into, heat your glass up first. Consider running your glass under warm water and then scalding hot water for a few minutes. This should keep the glass from shattering from the intense heat.  , When your oil has been strained, store your oil in a proper container with an airtight lid. Your oil will lose potency when exposed to oxygen. It will stay good for about two months.You can extend the shelf life longer by refrigerating it.  , Your cooking oil will likely be very potent. You probably do not want to substitute all of your cooking oil with marijuana infused oil. Try substituting only a small portion such as half fluid ounce or more until you know the strength of your oil.

By using a spreadsheet creator, such as Google Sheets, you can keep your To Do List organized and accessible.; , Tap the green spreadsheet icon either in your home screen or app drawer labelled “Sheets.” This will bring you to the Google Sheets main screen.  , Tap the + icon in the lower-right corner to create a new sheet. It will be blank and have “Untitled spreadsheet” as its title.   You can rename the sheet by pressing the back key once to go back to the list of sheets, and tapping the three-dot menu icon in the lower right corner of the sheet’s tile. Tap “Rename,” and key in the name you wish the To-Do List to have.  , This list will contain all the activities you plan to complete during your work hours. The first column should contain the activities. The second column will be for markers; after finishing an activity, place an X on this column to mark it as finished.   It is important to budget how many pomodoros (25-minute work intervals) you must dedicate to an activity, so you are assured that you have just enough time to complete it. Beside every activity, place the type of activity before the activity’s name, followed by a colon (:). For instance, “Write: How to Be More Productive with Pomodroid” as the first activity, and then “Refine: How to Be More Productive with Pomodroid” as the second activity. This way, you have time to create content for the piece while you have a dedicated pomodoro for making sure the article has top-notch quality.  , Tap the red tomato-shaped kitchen timer icon either in your home screen or in the app drawer. This will launch Pomodroid and take you to its main screen.  , Once you are ready to begin working, tap the “Start” button at the lower left corner of the screen. The counter above the button will start while displaying the time remaining. Work uninterrupted until the times finishes.   When you find yourself distracted, you will have to stop the timer by tapping the “Pause” button right beside the “Start” button. Then you must begin the activity over again. This may sound a bit extreme, but it helps to keep you focused because the stakes are higher when you let yourself become distracted after long minutes of working. To restart the timer, tap the restart icon at the right side of the “Pause” button. To keep yourself from getting distracted, only have tabs open that are for work. Log off your social network, lock the office door, and have a strict Do Not Disturb policy at home or at work. The app will only count pomodoros as complete whenever the timer has reached its limit.  , After each pomodoro (25 minutes), you get a 5-minute break by default. Use this time to stretch, walk around the office, or get some snacks. It is also advisable to gather snacks before starting the work day so you do not waste time getting them during your precious break times.   Be strict about stopping work. When the time runs out, stop everything. If you have not finished the activity, then use as many pomodoros it takes to finish it. Make sure to keep track of your break times, as it is easy to lose track of time.  , After your break, resume working on the activity using another pomodoro, if you haven’t finished it yet.  , This is important in order to record your productivity when you make your progress report.  , Use Google Sheets, or the spreadsheet composer of your choice, to create another spreadsheet and title it “Progress Report.”  , Name the top cell of the first six columns: Date, Time, Type, Activity, Pomodoros, and Notes.  , The date column is for the date of the recording, Time is for time started, Type is for the kind of activity, Activity is for the description of the activity, Pomodoros is for how many pomodoros it took for you to complete the activity, and Notes for additional info regarding the activity.   It helps to have the inventory open as you work so you can quickly key in the data when you finish with each activity, or each pomodoro.  , After a few days of using the technique, you should begin to see improvements in how quickly you work, as well as the free time you generate from strictly using your time to work.   Mastering the technique should yield faster and more efficient work, as well as shortening the planning phase of each day since you will be able to accurately gauge how many pomodoros it takes to perform an activity, especially recurring activities.

So what is your character's posture like? Do they command the room or slouch in the corners? Do they move around or stay very still? Do they get really engaged when talking, or remain reserved and aloof?  You don't need to come up with unique tics and traits for every character, as this will be overkill for many parts. But you do need to think about how they stand, sit, and speak. Basic posture is easy to study if you're unsure -- walk into any restaurant or public setting and just people watch Separate yourself from the character. You might not use your hands when talking, but an older Italian character couldn't stop using them., Great actors remain in character the entire scene, feeding off their co-actors to keep the scene alive even when they're not talking. Knowing the other actor's lines and being ready to respond to them makes the entire performance better, and helps you stay in character.   Real people (not characters being acted) stay in the moment. Don't think about your next scene or a flubbed line from before -- clue right into the present moment. Watch Charlie Day in the show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia for a funny example of acting reactions. Even when he's in the background, he keeps up the nervous, unpredictable energy that makes his character (and the actor) so popular.  , Where you stress words matters as much as how fast you say them. Take the simple line, ""I love you."" You can stress all three words and get three different sounding sentences -- ""I love you."" (about ""me""); ""I love you"" (about discovering love); or ""I love you,"" (about them). You, as an actor, need to decide which of these moments is worth the most attention.  If in doubt, talk to the director. They may have a vision for the line or the character's arc that you need to mesh with. Emphasis is also important in monologues and paragraphs. In a long speech there is almost always a moment where the mood, subject, or idea evolves or switches. Find this point and make it a strong transition for your character.  , ""Blocking"" is where an actor stands, where they move, and when they do it. For film sets, this is usually meticulously mapped out to aid cameras, lights, and sound crews. It is essential that you stick to this blocking, otherwise you can ruin the entire shot, so don't try to improvise something new on the spot. Even theatrical actors need to stick to blocking consistently, as your movements dictate other actors' movements and some stage effects.  Good actors rehearse and find the role before shooting. That way they can show up and consistently hit marks and lines instead of trying to figure it out on the fly., An improv class teaches you the art of acting in the present. To be good at improv, the character will always appear naturally, because it is happening in real time and not dictated by a script. This will help build the essential skill of reacting to the events in real time and not reading off a page. It also raises your on-stage awareness of other lines, actors, and props.Many acting classes offer improv as a warm-up or a unit, so you can often get a little improv practice in with a ""classic"" acting class. When improvising, focus on building up the scene. Basically, this means always agreeing to your other actors, then adding a twist.

Acknowledging that alone time is a luxury for many people may help you to accept being alone and to enjoy your alone time as much as possible.   Try making a list of all the things that you enjoy doing and use your alone time to do some of these things. For example, you might include on your list things like, baking, knitting, painting, playing the guitar, or reading.  , Being single means that you are more than likely the sole responsibility in your life. You don’t have to think of anyone else when making decisions. Take advantage of this and treat yourself. Do something for yourself that you’ve always wanted to do.For example, buy yourself a nice car or save for a house. Take a trip to a place you’ve always dreamed of going. Learn a new hobby, get another degree, or take a class. Make this time about doing things you want to do.  , Instead of hitting the bars every night or sitting at home feeling depressed, go out and pursue your interests. This can help you find ways to be happy and keep from being desperate. Pursuing your interests can also give you opportunities to meet new people and socialize.For example, go to sports games or concerts. Find a book club or a group who likes to play board games. Get back into knitting or hiking. Figure out what your interests are and focus on them instead of your relationship status.  , It is natural to want to date and be in a fulfilling relationship. There is nothing wrong with wanting to love someone. But you should put your focus on yourself and learning how to love yourself. If you accept yourself and love yourself, you will find that you are less desperate to be in a relationship.Many desperate people need to be with someone. Often, this is because they don’t feel like they are enough. Stop thinking that you are not enough. You are not going to be able to truly love someone else until you love yourself. You might even try dating yourself. Things like getting dressed up, going out to exotic restaurants, and receiving compliments and presents are all things that you can do for yourself. Try taking yourself out on a date at least once per week. When you do, get dressed up, go someplace special or prepare yourself a special meal, and give yourself compliments and presents.  , Many single people think that they are missing something from their life if they are not in a relationship. They also think that their life can’t start until they are with someone. Try to stop thinking this way. Your life can be full and fulfilling even if you are single.Think about the things that are good in your life. Make a list of things you enjoy, things that are positive in your life, and things you are proud of. This can help you see how important your life already is.  , You may really want a relationship, but you shouldn’t drop and ignore your friends. You may stop hanging out with your friends in order to go places where you can find a partner, or the moment you get a date, you forget you have friends. Balance your life and keep spending time with your friends.Your friends aren’t going to give you romantic satisfaction, but your friends can provide you with support, understanding, and companionship even if you are single. Don’t ignore the pleasure of the relationships with your friends just because you don’t want to be single. Maintain good relationships with your old friends and family members. You can even work on making some new friends. Work on cultivating a full, enjoyable social life without dating someone.  ",636,"['friends', 'something', 'interests', 'alone time', 'life']"

By Christmas time, this money is available for you to spend as you see fit, rather than having to accept the choices of a Christmas club.; , This is not a time to keep up a pretense of wealth and ""anything goes"". Everyone knows when a recession happens, and although not everyone suffers equally, it is well understood that only the foolish spend money unwisely during such a time. Explain to family members that expectations in the gift department must be lowered for a recession Christmas but that this doesn't mean the tree will be bare. Instead, ask your family to come up with creative alternatives to spending a lot of money on gifts. Some examples might include:   Homegrown favorite herbs, flowers, citrus, ferns, etc. Sewn items from aprons to eye pillows, using fabric already at home, or purchased at sales Re-gifted items – gifts received during the year that were not wanted, duplicated, etc. can be re-given to those who will appreciate them Baked goods – homemade candies, cakes, chocolates, cookies, preserves, jellies, etc. are ideal gifts. Not only are they tasty but family members can get really creative making these and team spirit can also prevail if several members get into the kitchen at once! Coupons – for personal services. Offer to wash a car monthly for a year, to take the dogs for regular walks, to give a regular massage, to make a special meal once a month, to go hiking somewhere together, to have a picnic together, etc. There are just so many ideas of how you can gift your talents, expertise, skills, and labor to others that the only limit is your availability and willingness! Photos - create a montage of family and friends; don't forget the pets! Or, take the time to arrange photos in an album for a family member who has never taken the time to do this.  , Excess is excess and if you really admit it to yourself, having more money to spend on gifts doesn't necessarily reduce the stress of obtaining them, and can in fact increase expectations and worries. Less money should equal less fuss and more thoughtful input from each purchaser.  , Many Christmas spreads overdo the food, and there are leftovers aplenty for days to follow. Skip that mentality and only make enough for the day; reduce the size of the poultry, reduce the expensive food items. Make better use of homemade food such as specialty bread, cookies, cake, baked nuts, etc. Use seasonal vegetables and fruit – these will be far cheaper than food shipped or flown in for the occasion.  , In case anyone has missed the real message of Christmas, recession time is an ideal time to reinforce this message. For those celebrating a faith-based Christmas, retell the stories of Jesus' life and the values he espoused about loving one another and not money. If you are celebrating a secular Christmas, the message is no less pertinent – rewatch the story of Scrooge in Dickens' A Christmas Carol to see where hoarding money and never truly giving leads to.  , Anything that can be made from paper should be made at home. Not only is this budget-conscious but it's way more fun than buying processed gift wrap and cards from the store. There are so many possibilities: drawings, photos, stickers, stamping, printing, finger-painting, collages, scrapbooking, recycling, etc. Get creative and get chatting with one another as you craft your cards and wrapping.  , When you all draw together and seriously address the need to reduce costs at Christmas, you can find your family gelling as a team and spending more time together problem-solving. This is a good outcome, and is a gentle reminder that money cannot buy all our needs.  , A very humble way to deal with Christmas in a recession is to look around at those worse off than you. There will always be many people in this situation. Ask your family for ideas of ways you might be able to help out; perhaps some members can spend Christmas morning helping to prepare Christmas food for the homeless at a local charity? Even if you're in very bad financial shape yourself (something you should not ignore but seek help for), you will benefit from reaching out to help others too; it gives a perspective to things that you won't otherwise get just thinking about your own troubles.  , This is a fun way to give yourself a little cheer.Some advent calendars are very inexpensive.A lot of times,they won't break your diet either.

"['postpone social security payments', 'take tax-free income first', 'withdraw from roth accounts', 'make minimum compulsory distributions when legally required', 'take taxable investment income as needed', 'defer payment from traditional retirement accounts']",How to Reduce Taxes in Retirement2," A retiree can start collecting Social Security benefits at any age between 62 and 70. However, starting later means that the checks are larger. From a tax perspective, only 50 percent of your Social Security benefits count towards your income. This means that waiting to collect benefits until later could maximize your income while reducing your tax burden., You have several options for tax-free income in retirement. The first is municipal bonds from your own state. Interests from these bonds is typically not taxable at any level (local, state, or federal). However, capital gains or discounts on bond purchases related to these bonds may still be taxable. Losses recognized on the sale of the bond may be used to offset income or other capital gains in some cases.   Another tax-free option is taking advantage of the cash value of a life insurance policy. These may be tax-free if the policy follows IRS rules for tax-free distributions., Withdrawals on Roth accounts are tax free, because after tax income is used to add to the accounts.You can withdraw from the contributions in a Roth account at any time, tax and penalty free. You can withdraw from the earnings after 5 years and age 59½, tax free and penalty free. Prior to these time limits, withdrawals of earnings are still tax free, but not penalty free.  , Mandatory Required Distributions (MRDs), are amounts from your retirement accounts that have to be withdrawn after you have held them for a certain length of time or you’ve reached a certain age.Traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, and Roth 401(k)s all have MRDs. With traditional IRAs, the MRD begins at 70½ years. The two types of 401(k)s have the same age requirement, with the exception that for people 70½ who are still working.If the MRD is not taken, the amount of the MRD is taxed at 50%.  , Taxable accounts include mutual funds, brokerage accounts, and any money realized from capital gains.Taking from these accounts late allows you to take advantage of the benefits of long term capital gains on your investments. Remember to keep assets as long as they are appreciating in value. Let profits run while cutting losses short.   You want to draw from these accounts first because the longer you live, the more you tap into your retirement savings, which diminishes them. At the end of life, you don’t want to see the money you use to live on taken by taxes. These are called taxable because you invest in the account initially with post-tax income, and you pay whenever you receive the return on the investment. So if a credit union pays yearly dividends on a savings account, you have to pay taxes on those dividends each year. Collectibles are taxed at a higher rate than other capital gains—as high as 28%--but that is still lower than the tax on earned income. The distributions from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Therefore, you can liquidate all or a portion of an account like a 401(k) or an IRA at the beginning of retirement, make a capital investment with the money, and then sell it off after a year. Even if you take a loss on the investment, the loss might be less than the difference in tax liability. Capital gains taxes are progressively bracketed like regular income taxes, just at lower rates. Charles Schwab provides a full table.  , Traditional retirement accounts are taxed at withdrawal and include traditional IRAs and 401(k)s. IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account and a 401(k) is a retirement sponsored by your employer. These two account types are among the oldest and most popular types of retirement accounts to invest in. However, traditional accounts have few advantages for a retiree unless he or she has considerable taxable income. Since taxes are typically lower for a retiree with less income, a Roth account is almost always preferable to traditional accounts.You must retire, die, or turn 59 ½ in order to withdraw without penalty from a 401(k). There are hardship exemptions with some plans, and you can see a list of common ones at http://www.finra.org/investors/401k-hardship-withdrawals%E2%80%94understand-tax-bite-and-long-term-consequences   ",687,"['social security payments', 'minimum compulsory distributions', 'traditional retirement accounts', 'tax-free income', 'payment', 'taxable investment income', 'roth accounts']"

You may have reached a plateau with your current workout routine if you are not seeing results within an expected timeframe and other factors like diet have remained consistent.If you have reached a plateau with your weight loss goals, you could try breaking up your workout into two workouts a day. This will allow you to multiply the calorie burning benefits of exercise, since your heart rate will be increased twice in a day.; , Considering all of the workouts you do during the week, count up the number of hours that you put in. Guidelines from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommend at least two and a half hours of activity per week. If you are not putting in at least two and a half hours, your workout routine may be too easy., You can manually check your heart rate with your index and middle finger. With one hand facing up, place your index and middle finger one inch below your wrist. Adjust your fingers until you can feel your pulse. Count the number of beats you feel for sixty seconds to get your beats per minute.If you prefer, you can use a heart rate monitor. Place the strap of the heart rate monitor around your chest and look at the wristwatch/readout to see your current heart rate., You can figure out if your workout is too easy by observing whether your heart rate is too low. To figure this out, start by determining your maximum heart rate. A simple way to do this is to minus your age in years from 220.If you are thirty years old, your maximum heart rate will be approximately 190. If you are forty years old, your maximum heart rate would be 180.  , You will know you are not working hard enough if you do not reach at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate.Some physical trainers recommend aiming for a higher percentage of your maximum heart rate during workouts, such as 70 to 85 percent.The percentage of your maximum heart rate you strive for will depend on your particular fitness goals, but you should observe your heart rate to make sure you are at least reaching sixty percent.If you are thirty years old, have a maximum heart rate of 190 and you want to maintain at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate, you should aim for a heart rate of 114 beats per minute. If it goes below that number, you should work a little harder. If you are not reaching sixty percent, you could work harder by increasing the speed or incline on your treadmill. Run faster until you get to at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate and then continue for the rest of your workout. If you are running outside, you could try running very fast for a minute and then going back to your regular pace. Repeat this process until you get to at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate. You could also try other forms of interval training at the gym., If you have been doing the same routine for a while and you notice your heart rate is not reaching the same level as normal, it could be an indication that you need to switch your workout routine. Consider working a little harder or doing a new exercise to challenge your body in a new way. With your new routine, try to maintain at least sixty percent of your maximum heart rate.",605,"['routine', 'heart rate', 'total hours', 'percent', 'goals', 'maximum heart rate', 'weekly workout routine']"

Look for any of the following symptoms:Nasal discharge Sneezing Nose-pawing or nose-bleeds Head shaking Gagging Salivation Difficulty swallowing or breathing Bad breath Pawing at the face and mouth Coughing Retching Blue coloured gums Fainting Anorexia; , In most instances a foreign body, such as a blade of grass or a piece of a stick, will enter your cat while they are smelling or chewing these objects. Keep a close eye on your cat while it is playing outside. This way you will have a better indication of what might be the problem if your cat starts to develop symptoms., If you notice any common symptoms associated with a respiratory foreign body, or you believe your cat may have ingested a foreign object, you should take your cat to the vet immediately. If left untreated, a foreign body in the respiratory system could cause an infection or lead to chronic lung disease. In some cases the foreign object may travel through the body, causing severe complications and even death.Your vet will need to run a number of tests in order to rule out other possible illnesses and to find the exact location of the foreign object.  , Your vet will likely need to administer a number of examinations in order to determine the exact location of the foreign object. An examination can also provide your vet with more detailed information concerning the type of object that has been lodged in the respiratory system. Your vet may administer any of the following tests:A complete blood count (CBC), biochemical profile, and urinalysis. An x-ray of the throat and chest. Skull/nasal radiographs. A scope may be used to evaluate the nasal cavity, trachea, and bronchi. A CT Scan or MRI may be useful in some cases.  , This is often done by administering a local anesthetic and then reaching in and grabbing the object from the throat or nasal cavity. This type of removal is only possible if the object is visible and easily accessible.In some cases, you may be able to do this without the help of a vet, if you are able to see the object and are certain you can remove it completely and without causing any damage to the nasal passage. It is safest to let the vet do any removal, however.  , Your vet may be able to encourage the foreign object to dislodge itself, by flushing the respiratory tract. A lubricant will be flushed through the respiratory tract in the hope of dislodging and washing out the foreign object., To remove a foreign body using a scope, the vet will place a tube into the cat’s nasal cavity or throat and pull out the object. Typically the object will be removed using forceps or a balloon catheter.If the lodged object is sharp, a protective tube can be placed down the cat’s throat to protect the esophagus while the object is retrieved.  , In severe cases, the foreign object may be lodged deep within your cat’s internal respiratory system. In these instances, the vet may need to complete a surgery to remove the object. Your vet may use a local anesthetic or full anesthesia, depending on the location and invasiveness of the procedure.This type of surgery is relatively common and safe, and has a 93% recovery rate., Although cats generally recover quickly from removal procedures, it is still a good idea to schedule a follow-up appointment with your vet. During this appointment your vet will check to make sure that your cat is not suffering from any lingering pain or infection as a result of the lodged object or removal procedure., Your vet may notice that the foreign body has caused a secondary infection. This happens if the foreign body contained bacteria that was spread to the cat. If this is the case, your vet will prescribe antibiotics to help treat the secondary infection.Follow all instructions provided by your vet for administering the antibiotic.  , If your vet suspects that your cat is still experiencing residual pain as a result of the foreign object removal, they may prescribe pain medication during the follow-up appointment. It is very important that you follow of the instructions provided by the vet when administering medication.For example, your vet may prescribe a corticosteroid, such as methylprednisolone., Giving your cat wet food can also alleviate pain following this procedure. This type of food is typically softer and will be less irritating if your cat experienced a foreign body lodged in the throat.

One way to develop better self-esteem is to think about all of your strengths. Make a list of all the qualities you feel describe you as a person. Also, think about ways others have spoken highly of your personal traits in the past. Include these compliments on the list as well.Tape this list on your bathroom mirror so whenever you find yourself judging your physical appearance, you can immediately correct these judgments by focusing on positive strengths you have in other areas of life.; , This method is not suggesting that you point out specific aspects of your appearance like a slim nose or thighs. Instead, you need to direct your attention on how awesome the human body is without regard to appearance. For instance, you can pinpoint amazing abilities and functions that you are able to carry out because of your body.   Whenever you catch yourself being nit-picky about any perceived flaws on your body, try to correct yourself and declare positive affirmations like ""My legs and arms allow me to do cartwheels."", ""My heart is so strong it delivers blood to my entire body."" or ""My nose helps me to smell these beautiful flowers."" Your body image may be poor if you are always directing your attention on what you think it is lacking. You can develop higher self-esteem and confidence if you uplift the wonderful things your body helps you to do.  , Socio-cultural factors present through media, the Western perception of thinness as a beauty ideal, and opinions formed in local communities or cultures may strongly influence young people who develop unhealthy views of their bodies.Be a rebel and admonish images on TV, the internet, or in magazines of females who are significantly underweight and males who are idolized for having perfectly muscular bodies. Make a point of reminding yourself that these are not real portrayals of the true range of human bodies.  , When you hear your mother, sisters, brothers, or friends down certain parts of their bodies for being too large or not good enough, stop them in their tracks. Tell them that speaking bad about their bodies is an unhealthy behavior and immediately compliment them on something that is not related to appearance such as them being awesome at soccer or having the highest GPA in their class.   Dissatisfaction with one's physical appearance is a warning sign for anorexia and other eating disorders.Reminding your friends of this may help to promote awareness and also help you to reinforce thinking about your body in a more positive manner.  , When you spend so much time idealizing a certain body weight you begin to view this as a key to happiness and feeling good about yourself. This is an unhealthy viewpoint and can lead to developing anorexia.   Despite what may be uplifted in the media, there is no ideal body types. Healthy human bodies come in all shapes and sizes. Furthermore, no amount of weight loss or change will suddenly make your life more exciting or enjoyable.If you have formed an association between happiness in life and your appearance, it may be necessary to visit with a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy. This type of treatment may be helpful for individuals at risk of eating disorders because it helps them identify and alter irrational or inaccurate thoughts and beliefs., Researchers have found a link between perfectionism and body dissatisfaction - a common problem for individuals with eating disorders.Therefore, you will need to do away with perfectionist tendencies and your need to control every situation if you want to avoid developing anorexia.Perfectionism is demonstrated when you often have trouble meeting your own standards. You may be very critical of yourself and your abilities. You may also procrastinate on tasks or do them over and over again until they meet your standards. You can speak see a therapist for help with overcoming perfectionism. Cognitive-behavioral therapy may be helpful in pinpointing perfectionist beliefs and finding ways of developing healthier expectations for yourself.

"['choose the appropriate time to talk', 'offer your sympathies', 'state a specific offer of help', 'accept their refusal graciously', 'avoid touchy subjects']",How to Comfort Someone Who Lost a Loved One1," In all of your interactions, make sure that bereaved person is in the proper mindset to have a discussion. They may be particularly upset or dealing with another critical issue. Ask if it is a good time to talk before going on. It also usually a good idea to talk with them one-on-one, when possible.   People can be particularly touchy about receiving gifts, even after a funeral, so approaching them when they are alone will maximize the odds of them accepting your offer of help. At the same time, don't let waiting for the ""perfect"" time become an excuse for not reaching out to this person. There may never be a ""good"" time to talk, but you should be able to identify that some times are better than others. For instance, when they are in the middle of talking with the funeral director or arguing with their child, it's probably best to wait.; , As soon as you learn of the death, try to reach out quickly to the person you know. You can send an email, but it is really best if you make a phone call or go to see them in person. You don’t have to say too much in this first conversation, just a quick, “I’m so sorry,” followed by a positive comment about the deceased person is usually best. You can also promise to get a hold of them again shortly to check in.It's important that your words are sincere and genuinely sympathetic. If you don't know what to say, it's okay to say something like ""I wish I knew what to say. I just want you to know I'm here for you."" If the person who you are talking to doesn’t know you personally, make sure to offer a quick introduction letting them know how you knew the deceased. Otherwise, they may not feel comfortable talking with you. You might say, “I’m Michael Smith and I worked with Noah in the lab at NYU.” If the bereaved seems almost rude or is really hasty with you, don’t take it personally. It is likely that they are overwhelmed and are not behaving as they usually do. There are some things you should avoid saying. It’s generally not a good idea to talk about “moving on” in this initial conversation. You should also avoid platitudes like ""He's in a better place,"" ""It was her time,"" ""Be strong,"" ""I know exactly what you're going through,"" ""There's a reason for everything.""The grieving person likely doesn’t want to hear it and your words will likely not be appreciated. Instead, keep it short and simple and let them know you are there to support them., In your next conversation, it’s a good idea to follow through on your first offer of assistance. Try to be as specific as you can. This will help them to see how you can actually help and it will make it more doable on your end. Choose a certain activity to assist with and give some thought as to how much time it will take.For example, if only have a limited amount of time, you could offer to pick-up the extra flowers from the funeral and donate them to a hospital or other charity. Many people will make a general offer of assistance and say something like, ""Call if you need me,"" putting it on the grieving person to ask for help. But the grieving person may be hesitant to ask for anything or be a burden on others. Instead of putting the responsibility on the grieving person, come forward with a specific offer, like ""I'd like to help by bringing you dinner tomorrow so you don't have to worry about cooking. Is that alright?""  , If you offer assistance and they turn you down, it is probably best to leave it alone or try again at another date. Whatever you do, don’t take it personally. There is a good possibility that the bereaved is overwhelmed with offers and are uncertain as to how to sort everything out.   You might say, “I understand your hesitation. How about we talk again next week?”  , During your conversations, try to weigh the degree to which any efforts at humor would be accepted. Basically, don’t joke around unless you know the person very well. And, it is a good idea to not discuss the cause of death, unless you know the person very well too. Otherwise, they may see you as a gossip-hunter and not a sincere person.  ",750,"['appropriate time', 'sympathies', 'refusal', 'touchy subjects', 'help', 'specific offer']"

Nonetheless, if you're trying to make new friends, show up to events you're invited to. In addition, show up to more personal appointments, too. That is, if a friend invites you for coffee or to the movies, agree to go. In return, ask people you know to go have coffee with you.In addition, if coworkers reach out to you to start friendships, encourage the interaction.  , If you're going to make someone your best friend, you can't leave your friendship on superficial topics such as the weather. Try to make the relationship go deeper by encouraging more substantial conversation. Ask about her hopes and dreams. Talk about what keeps you up at night. Ask her what she worries about. Question her about what she likes and why she likes those things, such as her favorite movies, books, and quotes. Pushing the conversation further helps you get to know each other.You're asking the other person to be vulnerable, so you must learn to be vulnerable in turn. Try to share personal stuff about yourself, as well.  , Show your new friends you appreciate them with your body language. That is, smile when they enter the room. When they are talking, be sure to give them your full attention, even with your body. Don't be looking at your phone or fidgeting with something to the side. Giving nonverbal clues help to establish that you want to be a good friend.For instance, make sure your body is pointing towards the person, and try not to cross your arms, as that can signal you don't want to talk to the person.  , Of course, you want a friend who will lend you an ear when you need it. However, that also means you need to be willing to do the same. Pay attention to what your friend is saying, and try to listen between the words to find out if she's really trying to signal something more.For example, if your friend says, ""I've been pursuing my own interests lately."" when you ask her how her and her spouse are doing, that may signal she's having a little bit of trouble with her marriage and may want to talk about it.  , Friendships, like romantic relationships, don't happen overnight. They need time to grow and build. Be patient with your new friends, and let the deeper relationship grow over time.For example, at work you may start talking to someone more often. However, it may be several weeks before you go out and have dinner together, just because of the nature of work friendships. Many do not move beyond the office.  , To show that you care for your friend, you have to show up when you say you will. That doesn't just mean you show up for the good times. You need to be there for the bad times, too., It's really the little things that make up a friendship. As you grow closer to people, performing small gestures can mean a lot, such as bringing the person a cup of coffee, dropping a note in the mail, or even bringing the person a meal when she's feeling down., That is, consider going out of town together for a bit. Spending all day, every day together for a few days is sure to bring you closer together, especially if you're holed up in the same hotel room with each other. Plan a fun little getaway together., Not all friendships can turn into best friendships. In fact, most won't.Many people only have three to five very close relationships, so if you've got that number of friends or relationships, you're doing just fine.In fact, you may find that the more you get to know a person, the more you dislike him or her.

To make a magic ring, loop the yarn around your index and middle fingers twice. Then, slide the double loop off your fingers and insert your hook into the center. Yarn over and then pull this loop back to the outside of the circle. Then, yarn over the hook again above the circle and pull this loop through the first loop. This will be your first stitch.Work five more stitches around the ring in the same fashion for a total of six stitches. When you are finished, tug the tail of the yarn to close the ring and then slipstitch to connect the last stitch to the first stitch.; , For the next round, start by chaining two stitches.These two stitches will mark the beginning of your next round. You will not need to do this again.  , To make your first bullion stitch, loop the yarn around your hook seven times. Then, insert the hook into the first stitch in the round and loop the yarn over your hook again. Pull this yarn through the first loop on your hook. Then, yarn over again and pull through the rest of the loops.Go slowly and just focus on working off one loop at a time. Try to maintain consistent tension as you go. When you finish your first bullion stitch, work another into the same space. Continue to work two bullion stitches into every stitch in the ring.  , Once you complete the final bullion stitch for the round, you will need to connect this last stitch to the first one and then tie off your final stitch. Use a slipstitch to connect the first and last stitches.To slipstitch, insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over. Then pull the yarn through both loops. To tie off and finish your work, snip the yarn leaving a tail that is long enough to tie in a knot. Pull the tail of the yarn through the loop to secure the final stitch into a knot. Then, tie the yarn through this stitch again to secure it. Snip the end close to the knot to finish your flower.  , The bullion stitch works well with many different types of yarn, but choosing a special color or textured yarn can alter your finished product. Try choosing a multicolor yarn for colorful flowers, or choose a fluffy yarn for soft touchable flowers.   Remember to check the yarn label for recommendations about what hook size will work best with your yarn.  , Using a latch hook instead of a crochet hook can help to ensure that your tension is even throughout the stitch. A latch hook can also make working this stitch a little easier.To use a latch hook, loop the yarn around the hook the same way that you would with a crochet hook and then pull through the first loop. Then, loop the yarn over the hook again and pull through the rest of the loops. The latch will close and prevent the hook from getting caught on the loops as you pull through, so this should be one smooth movement.  , You can easily change the size of a bullion stitch by looping the yarn around the hook a few more times.For example, looping the yarn around 10 times will create a smaller bullion stitch than looping it around 15 times.   You can even try alternating between bullion stitch sizes. For example, you could start with bullion stitch that has seven loops and alternate with bullion stitches that have 14 loops. This will create a noticeable contrast in your flower petals.  , Adding one or more extra bullion stitches into every stitch in the round will also change the appearance of your flowers. The flowers will seem fuller and even a bit ruffled.Try doing three or four bullion stitches into each stitch in the round to change the look of your crocheted bullion flowers.

If you can breathe in more air, your voice will be stronger, and it's less likely that your voice will crack., If you're like many people, you breathe from your chest without much support from your diaphragm. However, breathing from your diaphragm gives your voice more support, making it stronger.When breathing, make sure you expand your stomach as you breathe in.  , Joining a community choir is a great way to help develop diaphragm breathing, but it's not the only way. You can also try out for community theater or take an acting class, as learning to project also teaches you this type of breathing., Another way you can develop your breathing is to practice theater breathing exercises on your own. One you can try is making an ""fffffffff"" sound. However, as you make the noise, don't change the position of your chest or stomach. When you do need to breathe, imagine it in your stomach and try to breathe from there.You can also switch up the sounds, using ""ssssss,"" ""hummmmm,"" or ""vvvvvvv."" You can also try reading the nursery rhyme ""The House that Jack Built."" This story is broken up into main thoughts. Try to draw enough breath for each thought, so you don't need to stop in the middle of it to breathe. Speak slowly and deliberately, keeping each thought at the same speed.  , If you try to increase the strength of your voice without breathing properly, you'll just end up shouting. That can cause your voice to crack and will push people away. However, when your breathing is properly supported, you'll project calmness and confidence without shouting., Justified or not, manliness is associated with confidence. If you speak with confidence, you are more likely to convince others of your power. Try not to hesitate or trip over words. If you need to, think about what you're going to say before you say it., As you speak, think about speaking in a lower tone. Just being conscious of your pitch can help you drop your voice to a lower range. It also may help to speak slow and steady, so you don't rush and make your pitch go higher., More manly voices tend to have more chest resonance.You can use exercises to help place your voice more in your chest, rather than just in your mouth or nose.Try the deep breathing technique where you breathe from your diaphragm. But as you do, lean your head back so your throat is basically a straight line. Try breathing in this position for a few seconds, then add in sounds like vowels or consonants.  , A voice coach can work with you to develop the strength and depth of your voice. They can help you access some of the lower ranges to create a more manly sounding voice., If your voice is unnaturally high, you could have a health problem or an imbalance of hormones. Visit your doctor to see if maybe they have a solution that will fix the health problem and possibly deepen your voice., If you're transitioning, you may already be on testosterone. If you aren't and you're wanting to make your voice more manly, you may want to ask your doctor about taking it. Testosterone can increase the thickness of your larynx, which in turn can deepen your voice., Certain patterns of speech are ingrained along gender lines. For instance, women are more likely to lift up in pitch at the end of a sentence (essentially making it more of a question), as well as apologize more often. While you'll be able to figure out some of these on your own just by listening to the women and men around you, a voice coach can help you assess the ways you can change your voice.You can also try recording yourself and playing it back. You'll be able to hear your patterns of speech better.  , In today's world, you know there's an app for everything, including some that analyze your voice's pitch and help you work on lowering it. One app is called Eva, and it's specifically designed for transgender people who are transitioning., Some people who are transitioning will have a surgery performed on their larynx. With this surgery, the surgeon will place silicone implants in your vocal cords, which thickens them, deepening your voice.Other types of surgery loosen the tension in your vocal cords, which deepens your voice.

"['do not take negativity personally', 'resist the urge to argue', 'tune it out', 'have compassion', 'give in on occasion']",How to Live with an Overly Critical Person1," The most important thing to remember is that it's not about you. If a person is generally critical or negative, chances are they would complain about anyone. When being criticized, try to calm yourself down and remember not to take it personally.   Consider the source of the criticism. Is the person you're living with generally critical? Does he or she complain about work, school, and other friends? If so, this person may simply have a negative outlook. Their criticism is a reflection of that worldview. It is not an objective judgement of your character.Try to remember you're worthwhile. There may be some thread of validity to the criticism. We could all use to improve in some areas. However, flaws and imperfections do not define your character. Your roommate may be right when he points out you always forget to throw out empty milk containers. However, he's choosing to focus on that flaw over your other qualities.; , It's almost always a bad idea to argue with a critical person. If someone is overly critical, they do not want to resolve a conflict. They simply want to complain. Even if it's difficult, try to resist arguing.   Use empathetic listening when someone is being critical. Simply repeat what the critical person is saying to you. This shows you're listening without forcing you to give in to unreasonable demands. This is a better technique than engaging in an argument. For example, say something like, ""So, I'm hearing you think it's unfair that I forgot to wash my dinner plate last night?""Critical people will often try to force you to engage with them. If you respond empathetically, they may continue to level criticism. Instead of arguing back, calmly state your opinion. You could say, ""I'm sorry that was frustrating for you, but I honestly forgot. I'll just clean it up now and try to remember next time."" If a person is very critical, they may continue to berate you past this point. Do not egg the person on. Simply continue to restate your opinion. Eventually, the other person will get bored and back off., Sometimes, the best means to deal with overly critical people is to learn to ignore them. For a critical person, complaining and nitpicking is simply a way of life. Learn to tune it out.   Overly critical people thrive on conflict and drama. The more you respond, the more likely they'll be to criticize. Therefore, try just responding with monosyllabic answers. When met with criticism, say something like, ""Uh-huh,"" ""Yeah,"" or ""Okay."", Overly critical people are often unhappy themselves. They often have unreasonably high expectations for their own achievements and personal conduct. If someone you live with criticizes you frequently, have some compassion.   Understand you only have to deal with a critical person in the moment. A critical person, on the other hand, has to deal with him or herself all the time. There's a good chance your roommate, family member, romantic partner, or friend criticizes you because of his or her own sense of inadequacy.When someone is criticizing you, consider that person's perspective. There may be reasons he or she is overly critical. For example, say you're a college student living at home. Your father may constantly berate you about your study habits. Consider his perspective. Maybe your dad never got a chance to go to school himself. He could feel insecure in your presence as you're achieving something he never had the chance to achieve. The criticism is not personal. It's a reflection of your father's unhappiness. Sometimes, simply having compassion for someone can ease your frustration with that person., If you're living with an overly critical person, sometimes it's easier to let go of minor things. If your boyfriend bites your head off when you don't fold the laundry in a particular fashion, just to do it his way. It's not a big concession to make and it can ease up on some tension.Even if someone is being unreasonably critical, there could be validity to their complaints. As stated previously, we all have bad habits. It can be annoying if your roommate complains continuously that you leave the bathroom floor wet after you shower. However, someone could slip and fall. Rather than getting annoyed, simply try to wipe up any water with a towel when you finish showering.  ",720,"['occasion', 'negativity', 'urge', 'compassion']"

Some schools do not make this clear on their website, so you may want to call them to verify. You will also want to compare the total cost of the schools you are considering.  Be wary of online traffic schools that do not include the cost of certificate processing or identity verification in their advertised price, and make note of what they are actually charging you before you process your credit card payment. Some schools offer price-matching so you can get a better deal.       ; , For most states, this is an easy process. The school will need to collect your personal information (name, address, phone number) as well as your driver's license information and citation information  Have this information handy when you fill out the registration form. Some schools allow you to begin the course with minimal information and without making payment, but all of this will be required from you at some point before you complete the course. If you received your ticket in the state of Arizona you will also be required to submit a copy of your driver's license and a copy of your ticket in order to register        , Almost all online traffic school courses will allow you to take the course at your leisure, as long as you complete it before the due date given to you by the court. This means that if you are in a hurry you can get it done all at once, or you could do just a little bit each day until you are finished. Depending on where you received your ticket, you may see ""page timers"" in your course that are there to ensure that you have met the minimum time requirement for your court.  , Some courts require that your identity be verified before you take your final exam. If this is the case for your court, there are a few different identity verification options you will be offered.  These may include online identity verification questions (based on public or credit records), using a web cam to verify your identity as compared to your driver's license, taking the exam at an in-person testing center, or taking the exam in the presence of a notary.        , Most states require you to take a final exam in order to complete traffic school. The number of questions and amount of re-takes you are allowed vary by court.  , Many courts allow the traffic school to electronically send your certificate to them, but some courts require your signature on a paper certificate (meaning this has to be mailed to you by the traffic school, and then you are responsible for mailing the signed certificate to the court).  , About 2 weeks after your certificate has been sent to the court, it is recommended that you contact the court to verify that your case was dismissed. Some courts have a website that allows you to search by driver's license or citation number and then shows you the status of your case (for example, Los Angeles County and Pima County).  If your certificate was submitted to the court electronically by your traffic school, the school will likely be able to tell you if the court has dismissed your case as well.

But with practice, you'll learn to recognize the warning signs of anger when you mentally check in on yourself.Common signs of anger include angry/vengeful thoughts, muscle tension, headaches, or elevated heart rate. If you catch yourself speaking out loud (even when you're driving alone) about another driver, you may be experiencing elevated anger. By catching yourself as your anger first emerges, you can prevent that anger from turning into aggression or road rage.; , If you notice yourself feeling angry, it may be best to pull over (if it's safe to do so). Get off the highway or pull over to the shoulder of the road (again, only if it's safe to do this) and put your vehicle in park. Take a few minutes to collect your thoughts and calm yourself down before returning to the road.Practice deep breathing or meditation to calm your mind and body after experiencing anger. Remember that driving while you're angry puts yourself and others at risk. Even if you're not yet experiencing full-blown road rage, your anger may cause you to drive recklessly and take unnecessary risks.  , Using deep-breathing exercises can help you calm down and center yourself when you feel angry or tense. Deep breathing is quick and easy, and it can be done while you're driving or stationary.Take a long, slow inhalation into your diaphragm over a five-second span. Make sure you're breathing into your diaphragm (below your ribs) and belly instead of just taking shallow breaths in your chest. Hold your breath for five seconds Exhale slowly over another five-second span.  , A good way to relax when you start to experience road rage is to listen to soothing music (if you can do so without being distracted). Music can help you calm down and focus on getting to your destination safely.Try keeping a few relaxing CDs in an easy to reach spot in your car, or keep your radio tuned to a station that plays calming music. That way you can play music without having to take your eyes off the road. Figure out what types of music are most relaxing for you. Try jazz, oldies, and classical music for calm, soothing melodies. Avoid listening to fast-paced, aggressive, or angsty music while driving.  , You may have seen someone in your family or a character in a movie or TV show counting to avoid getting angry. It's an age-old trick to calm down and prevent an outburst, and it may help you in your moment of anger.Count upwards for about a minute. If you focus on your breathing and distract yourself with counting, you'll stop actively thinking about the person who wronged you and gradually cool down. If you don't feel better after a minute, try counting for another minute. The key is to stop yourself from thinking angry thoughts long enough for your active rage to pass.  , Hand yoga is the act of stretching and tensing/relaxing the muscles in your hands. It may sound strange, but for some people it's an excellent way to relieve stress - just be sure to only take your hands off the wheel when your car is at a complete stop in traffic or at a red light.Spread your fingers and stretch out both hands as much as possible. Hold this position for a few seconds, then release it. Curl each finger individually into your palm, pushing gently with your thumb. Hold it, then release. Flex your wrists and bend each knuckle individually to ""shake out"" the muscles and joints.  , If someone cuts you off or is driving too slowly, your initial reaction may be to honk your horn, scream, swear, or use profane gestures. This may make you feel better for an instant, but it will almost certainly aggravate the other driver, and could set you both down a rage-filled path.   Avoid any inflammatory gestures. This can include honking your horn, flashing your high beams, or extending your middle finger. Each of these may result in an escalated and violent reaction.Try to avoid even yelling or screaming. If you shout swear words at another driver and your window happens to be open, there’s a chance that driver could hear you and respond with his own aggression.  , Some people feel compelled to tailgate when they are cut off or otherwise ""wronged"" by other drivers. This is a potentially dangerous move. Tailgating increases the risk of causing an accident, and it could also trigger the other driver's anger.Use the four-second rule. When the car ahead of you passes a sign or lamp post, start counting and slow down so you don't pass that same post until at least four seconds later.

This is only if you actually want to look like Rosalie, not Nikki Reed. If your hair is any blonde but dirty blonde, don't get it dyed. If it's dirty blonde, use John Frieda Blonde Go Blonder shampoo and conditioner, and the lightening spray.   Take some bobby pins, and pull the longest parts of your hair up, and pin them to your head. Straighten, or curl the bottom part. When that's all done, take the bobby pins down, then pull the very longest part up again, and get the part under it. When that's done, do the top part, then pull half of your hair back. Another look is to just put it in long, wavy curls, as this is Rosalie's normal style. On I think October 1st, they're releasing Twilight hair products. There's a Rosalie brush to get her waves, and hot curls to get her curls. Buy them.; ,, Make sure when you apply it, you rub it in, and it looks natural. Next, get powder that is the same color, and apply it with a brush, not the pad that comes with it. Then, if you want to get the ""just fed"" look, get the lightest shade they have in blush, and apply it on the on your upper cheeks.  , If you don't need contacts, you can purchase a pair that only change your eye color and don't change your vision. Choose either gold or black contacts. You can even get both, so that gold means you just fed, and black means you haven't fed in a while.  , Apply it under your eye lashes, and then on top. Make this in an even line. Then get some Liquid eye liner, and put it on your top lids. Start in the middle, with a thin line, and then bring it all the way out to the corner of your eyes. But make this look natural. Then fill in the line in the corner of your eyes. If you aren't good at putting it on your top lids, or you just want a more natural look, put a little more than usual on your bottom lids and squeeze your eyes shut. This will make the eyeliner go on your top eyelids too and it won't look so dark on top. Take an eyelash curler, and curl your eyelashes BEFORE you apply mascara, or you will rip your lashes out. Then apply as much mascara as you can to your top lashes, but none to the bottom ones. It looks much better and more ""perfect"" when there is no clumps so either smooth it out while it's still wet, or buy a non-clump mascara. Also, buy a mascara that really volumizes each lash.  ,, Buy pants that are dark, and tight. Wear high-heel shoes with skinny jeans, that looks hot.

Rabbit foot ferns are available at garden centers and through online distributors.; , Because the rhizomes hang over the side of the container and can grow up to 2 feet (0.61 m) (.6 m) long, the rabbit foot fern is ideal for a hanging basket. The container should be either plastic or clay, and 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) in diameter. Plastic containers tend to allow for a more even distribution of water than clay pots, but clay pots are sturdier and may last longer.  , The soil should contain 2 parts peat moss, 1 part loam and 1 part sand or perlite, which is a volcanic glass with a high water content. The soil should have a neutral pH of 6.6 to 7.5.  , During the winter months, a north-facing window is an ideal location for the fern. During the spring and summer months, when the sun is higher on the horizon, choose an east-facing window with filtered light. Avoid south- and west-facing windows where the direct sunlight may scald the fern's fronds.  , Allow the soil in the container to dry out slightly between waterings. Over-watering will cause the fronds to yellow, and may result in root rot. Do not allow the plant to sit in water.   Mist the fuzzy rhizomes regularly. The rhizomes take up moisture. Mist them every few days, or as needed, to prevent them from drying out.  , Ferns thrive in moderate humidity. If your heat is on in your home during winter months, consider using a room humidifier where your rabbit foot fern is located. If you don't have a room humidifier, place the fern's container on a tray of wet pebbles to increase the humidity around the plant.  , The rabbit foot fern will thrive indoors in comfortable house temperatures. If the temperature drops below 60 degrees F (16 degrees C), check the plant before watering and only water when the soil is dry to the touch. If the temperature rises above 75 degrees F (24 degrees C), you may need to water the plant more often.  , Any liquid houseplant fertilizer can be used to feed the fern, but use only about half the recommended amount. Too much fertilizer may scorch the fronds. Do not fertilize newly potted plants for at least 4 to 6 months, or until the plant is showing signs of active growth.  , Thrips, mites and fungus gnats are often found on the foliage of houseplants like the rabbit foot fern. These pests like wet soil, so keep pests away by not over-watering. To remove pests, brush them off with a wet towel or a cotton swab dipped in alcohol. Most houseplant pesticides are not safe for use on ferns.  ,   Divide the rhizomes to create more rabbit foot fern plants. Carefully separate the rhizomes using a sharp knife, keeping the roots and stems attached. Place the rhizomes in a moist potting soil mixture and water as needed. The rhizomes hold a lot of water, so do not overwater the newly planted fern or it will rot. Propagate new rabbit foot fern plants with spores. Examine the underside of the leaves for spores. Remove a leaf with dark spores and place it in a paper bag. When the leaf dries, the spores will fall off. Plant the spores in a peat-based mixture. Water, cover with plastic, and keep at a temperature between 65 and 70 degrees F (18.3 and 21.1 C). When the fronds are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) high, remove the plastic and transplant the fronds to small containers.

It's fun to have your toy dog mailed to you. If you can't afford the toy yet, start saving up or ask for it as a gift for your birthday or other special occasion.; , You could base the name on what you love most. If you like the beach and Los Angeles, you could name your plush Pineapple, Neon or Sunny. If you like cold winter days, you could name it Cloudy, Misty, Snowball, Snowfall, Snowy, etc.   Use names people usually give dogs, such as Fido, Fluffball, Guy or Lassie.  , Braid strings together or get a real dog collar. Put on a license tag for the dog so that it can be returned if you misplace it. To make the license tag, get a piece of paper and write your stuffed animal's name down. Then write your phone number, so that if you lose your plush, the finder can call you and let you know that they have your stuffed toy dog.   Dollar store collars are another fine option for the stuffed toy dog.  , It could be real dog bed or just some soft blankets stacked up in a pile. Whatever it might be, it has to be comfortable for your cute plush puppy. Or, you could even let your pet sleep on your own bed.  , If you're handy with sewing, stitch them, otherwise use glue or clothing from other stuffed toys you own.  This is a great way to learn to sew and to improve your sewing––the stuffed toy dog won't mind how amateur the stitching is while you're learning.  , Check that your dog's license tag is firmly in place, just in case you lose it. Pack your dog's collars, costumes, sweaters, bows, etc. in a little bag. Keep your dog with you at all times. Keep it in your bag with its head sticking out, or carry it, so that your puppy can still be included in whatever you're doing for the day.  , Nothing shows more love than cuddling! Your plush puppy will love it.  , This is optional, because you might think your pet doesn't need to eat. If you want your pet to eat, then get some little cups of water or make some fake food for it to eat.   Cut out images of dog food from magazines. Glue these to some box cardboard and cut around to make the shape realistic. Feed this to your stuffed toy dog.  , Don't give it baths because it will be hard to get all that soap out.

The strip is small and pliable enough to be inserted into the tennis ball.  , Use scissors to snip the match heads off of the body. Don’t worry about being too precise. The bomb will still function if some match heads have a bit of wood left over.   Take care when handling the match heads. If you used strike anywhere matches, friction between the match heads could cause them to prematurely ignite. Separate the match heads into separate groups. That way, if a set of match heads accidentally ignite, you don't lose all of your work.  , Use a pair of sharp scissors, a knife, or a box cutter to cut into the tennis ball. You only need to create enough room to be able to insert the match heads. A pea-sized opening will suffice.   Make the hole a bit larger if you want to be able to insert several match heads at a time. A funnel is useful for adding match heads to the tennis ball, provided the funnel's material does not ignite the match heads as they are passing through.  , Take care to not accidentally strike any of the match heads while placing them in the tennis ball. This will ruin the tennis ball and potentially cause injury.   If you are using safety matches, insert the striker that you peeled from the match box only after you've placed all of the match heads into the tennis ball. The match heads will need to rub against this striker in order to ignite., Use between 1 and 3 layers of tape to cover the tennis ball. Increasing the thickness of the ball with tape will increase the power of the explosion thanks to a greater build up of internal pressure. Don't use too many layers, however, as covering the tennis ball with too many layers of tape will prevent the tennis ball from exploding.   Other types of tape, such as scotch or masking tape, do not provide the strength needed to build up enough internal pressure for the tennis ball to explode. Glue the hole in the tennis ball shut prior to wrapping in order to ensure the match heads are secured tight (optional).  , Give yourself and the explosive plenty of clearance. The tennis ball will detonate shortly after hitting the ground or receiving a solid jolt, so be careful when throwing the tennis ball. Sparks and debris will fly a greater distance depending on the number of matches in the tennis ball and how tightly it was wrapped.   The tennis ball will emit a large crack sound upon exploding, not unlike a firecracker. Though the explosion itself will not be terribly large, expect sparks, match heads, and debris to disperse in a large, variable area, depending on how tightly the tennis ball was wrapped in tape. If done correctly, the explosion will look like a miniature firework display. If the tennis ball does not detonate shortly after throwing, wait between 15 and 30 seconds before attempting to pick the tennis ball up again. You want to make absolutely sure nothing in the tennis ball has ignited before handling. A delayed explosion is possible if only a few match heads ignite upon impact. The tennis ball may also be launched using a tennis ball launcher or other mortar devices. Note that harsh movement will ignite the match heads within the ball. Launch a few standard tennis balls first to make sure the mortar works properly.  , Before purchasing any materials, make sure you understand the laws and regulations associated with explosives. These regulations range from the Federal level to more local jurisdictions. Make sure you are not performing something illegal in your area by doing your research.Go to your state police department website to read up on explosives and fireworks laws local to your area. Some states allow fireworks, but have a set definition on what the term includes. If you aren't using legal fireworks in that state, you are committing a felony.  , It goes without saying that creating a bomb is dangerous. There are a number of precautions that must be taken for safety when handling explosives and explosive materials.   Have an emergency supply of water nearby for putting out any fires. Wear safety glasses. Explosives (including a match head tennis ball bomb) create sparks and debris that can injure your eyes. Use explosives outdoors only. Give yourself, and the explosive, plenty of room to operate. Do not throw explosives at other people or animals., Fire risk is determined by the surroundings of where you set of the explosive. Strong winds or dry weather also further increase the risk of a spreading fire – explosives should not be detonated during such weather.   Do not set off the explosive near homes, sheds or other structures. Look for a site that is at least fifteen feet away from shrubs, trees or other flammable plant life. Detonate the bomb over dirt or gravel if possible. The explosion site should be surrounded by dirt and gravel for 10 feet in all directions. Once the bomb has exploded, travel to the detonation site to ensure embers are extinguished. Use water if necessary to put out kindling and cover with dirt and gravel to smother the remnants.

['pipe the dough into desired shapes as per the following suggestions'],How to Make Choux Pastry3,"   For profiteroles, hold the bag in an upright position and apply pressure from the top of the bag by twisting the top of the bag to increase pressure. When the paste starts to emerge, place the bag just above the baking paper so the paste touches the paper. Increase pressure by squeezing the bag (ensuring the twisted top does not open) and raise the bag gradually to pipe a ball approx 3cm across (1.25 inches) up to 4cm (1.6 inches) for large puffs. Reduce pressure and using a swift circular movement, cut off the dough. If a small spike remains, it can be patted down with a wet finger. Ensure you leave space for the balls to double in size before you pipe the next one. For beginners, it is very common to have the spike which reduces the more you practice, but is also a sign the dough was not beaten enough so it was a weaker paste. A wet finger gently patting the top will smooth the surface.  For éclairs, Pipe long lines approx 10cm to 4 inches long, but the trick is to ensure you have even pressure to give the best quality result. To cease piping, pull the bag swiftly back in the opposite direction, so if you were piping left to right, with a smooth movement reduce pressure and move the bag to the left.  To make a swan, pipe a wide and short éclair approx 2.5cm / 1 inch wide and 5cm / 2 inches long to make the body. On another tray, pipe an ""S"" shape in the same way as an éclair using a 1cm or 0.4 inch nozzle to make the neck. The piping bag should be even pressure and then cut off, leaving a short narrow end which will make the beak. For a beginner this is tricky so it is easiest to pipe a normal éclair as described and using wet fingers pinch the end to shape. It is best to bake the base of the swan first, then the necks in a separate batch. When cooled, split the body of the swan open and fill with cream, then place the neck in position.  Similar to eclairs, you can then pipe an array of shapes such as rings, letters, or any shape that you prefer. A large donut ring using a wide nozzle is often known as a Paris Brest, which is filled and often topped with chocolate sauce and praline.  To make a large base, or to create a Gateau Saint Honoré, make a paper template to place under your baking parchment. Using a piping bag, Pipe over the shape, either from the middle out in widening spirals, or the outside in, depending on your preferences. The Gâteau Saint-Honoré, is usually such a circle base and then topped with cream and individual puffs. The same method may be used to make squares, pillows and other shapes.  To make a Croquembouche, you will need a large batch of individual puffs. Fill them with whipped cream or pastry cream and create a large pyramidic stack. This is usually built around a cone-hat like frame, or the puffs are stacked and joined in layer with a little caramel as a glue. If you use a frame, it should be covered neatly with the puffs so its invisible. After the stack has been finished drizzle molten caramel over the cone, this is best done by dipping several metal skewers into the caramel and drizzling the caramel with a light waving movement to create fine strands.

"['get a clear picture of your overall debt', 'assess your current situation', 'understand the potential disadvantages of consolidation', 'decide who to contact']",How to Consolidate Student Loans1," Student loans can be confusing (you might have any combination of Stafford, Perkins, PLUS, and other federal loans, and you might also have private loans), and many borrowers don’t have an accurate sense of what they owe and to whom they owe it. Check your records, and make sure you have a complete list of all your loans, who services them, and what your current monthly payments are – whether you have actually been making those payments or not.   If you are unsure about your federal loans, visit the National Student Loan Data System at https://www.nslds.ed.gov/npas/index.htm. This site will allow you to see all of your federal financial aid records. If you are unsure about your private loans, follow up with the appropriate lender or lenders. They will provide documentation about what you owe and what the terms and conditions of your loans are.; , Once you have accurate, complete records, ask yourself whether you need to consider consolidation. Are you currently making your payments on time? Can you afford those payments? Are any of your payments delinquent? Are any of your federal loans in default status (meaning that you have not paid for 270 days)? If any of the following situations apply, you may be a good candidate for consolidation:   Your federal loans are in default. Consolidation will move them out of default status and minimize the effect on your credit rating. Your private loans are delinquent, and you are unable to get caught up. Consolidation will help you get the debt under control and minimize the long-term damage to your credit. You are making payments that you cannot afford, and you are worried that you will wind up delinquent or in default. Consolidation may help you get a lower monthly payment so that you can keep your loans current. You are making multiple monthly payments on different loans and want to simplify the process. Consolidation will allow you to make just one payment, if your loans are either all federal or all private. If you have both, you’ll have two payments, as you can’t consolidate them together.  , Consolidation does have a downside. Lower monthly payments mean that you’ll likely wind up making those payments for more years, and you’ll pay more in total. In addition:   For private loans, a fee of up to 18.5% of your loan balance may be added to your principal. Your interest rate may increase. Federal interest rates are capped at 8.25%, but that’s still quite high, especially when you consider that you may be paying for decades. Private lenders’ rates vary, but in general, consolidating your loans may entail a rate increase. You may lose benefits associated with specific loans. Consolidating eliminates your previously existing loans completely and merges them together under a new loan with different terms and conditions. Certain benefits, including principal rebates or interest rate discounts, will not carry over.You won’t be able to “unconsolidate” your loan. Once you’ve completed the consolidation process, you can’t go back to your previous situation. You could find yourself stuck with less-than-ideal terms and conditions.  , For federal student loans, there’s no question – you are better off consolidating with the Department of Education, where interest rates are capped and you keep your access to programs like deferment, forbearance, and forgiveness. For private loans, you’ll have to shop around, comparing servicers like Chase, NextStudent, Student Loan Network, and Wells Fargo, which are highly rated by Forbes.As you compare consolidation loans with various private companies, pay particular attention to the interest rate – this will make a huge difference in how much you wind up paying overall.

"['look for a caliber stamped or marked on the frame or barrel of your pistol (such as 9mm', '.45 acp or .38 spcl)', 'consider the type of ammo that you prefer', 'for target practice', 'almost any bullet will work', 'for hunting', 'accuracy', 'penetration', 'and expansion are the most important things', 'for self-defense', 'dependable function is second only to bullet placement', 'cost is also something to consider', 'look at the bullet weight', 'realize that some calibers can utilize different bullets', 'consider the source of your ammunition']",How to Pick Pistol Ammo1," The caliber of ammo on the box you use should match the markings on your pistol. Understand that caliber alone is not the soul requisite for choosing the correct ammo, there are several 45 caliber bullets, and more than one 9 mm, and these are not interchangeable.; , The type of bullet (or projectile that will be striking your target) varies and may be important if you are using the ammo for a specific activity such as either target shooting, hunting, or self-defense. Here are examples:   Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) have a brass or other metal casing surrounding the softer (usually lead) core. These are required by the Geneva Convention for military rounds, as they have very limited expansion, making combat wounds less devastating. They generally leave less fouling on the barrel's rifling, resulting in slightly better accuracy than some other rounds. Soft point bullets have the front, or tip of the bullets soft metal core exposed, but the sides and tail of the bullet are jacketed so they foul the barrel less than bullets with no jacket at all, and engage the barrel's rifling more aggressively. Hollow points have a hole in the center of the tip of the bullet, which causes more initial expansion on impact. There are arguments as to whether this feature affects accuracy, but the real results vary from gun to gun. Semi Wadcutter bullets are flattened on the end to create a shockwave in living tissue on impact. These are often a preferred round for self defense, since the generally do more damage than other bullets. Wadcutters have a completely flattened tip, again designed for causing maximum damage on impact. Shot shell bullets are bullets load with small bird shot, sometimes referred to as rat shot, used for shooting small varmints (hence the name) at very close ranges. Non Lethal rounds are special low velocity rounds used for riot control and other police/military purposes. Blanks, as the name implies, are blank cartridges, containing only a powder charge, used for theatrical purposes or in starter pistols. Other bullets include frangible bullets, tracers, and armor piercing rounds with special purposes not really addressed in this content.  , All you are doing is putting holes in paper. However, trying different types of bullets while target-shooting will give you an idea of how that bullet functions in your gun. How accurate the ammo is, and how dirty your gun becomes when using that ammo will be apparent as well. You can observe how much ""flash"", noise and recoil are produced.  , You may only get one shot at a living target; if you miss and scare it away. The bullet design is also important depending on what you are hunting, and more can be read about that elsewhere.  , You do not want to use a bullet type or under-powered ammo that will not function in your weapon.  , Use less expensive ammo for high-volume plinking. This will give you both familiarity and skill with your weapon. If you decide to use expensive or ""premium"" ammo for either hunting or self-defense, you must still try it out to be sure it functions in your weapon and that you can place the rounds where you need to.  , 9 mm bullets are usually available in loads of either 115, 124, or 147 grains. There are a number of other weights available from bullet manufacturers for special reloading applications. The lighter bullet will generally have a higher velocity, where heavier bullets may have more energy at impact, although this is a variable that also has to have distance factored in. Look for a middle ground weight in your caliber to begin with, then try lighter or heavier bullets according to your needs.  , A 357 Magnum revolver, for instance, can use a .38 caliber bullet, resulting in less noise and recoil and a substantially lower cost for target practice or plinking.  , Factory manufactured ammunition is made with strict quality controls using new brass and bullets, so it is, in most cases, the best choice for the average shooter. There will still be a significant difference in brands, and within brands. Some offer premium loads, target loads, hunting loads, and other levels of quality, and for practical purposes, the cheaper the bullet is, the lower the quality and the expected results achieved with it. Here are some of your options for buying ammo.   Retail stores. Big box stores like Walmart carry handgun ammo at most locations. They may have a limited variety of common calibers at competitive prices, but for specialized rounds or unusual calibers, you will have to look elsewhere. Sporting goods stores will have a wider selection, and large, chain type stores will also have competitive pricing. One advantage of shopping a sporting goods store with a firearms department is the likelihood the counter help will be more knowledgeable about the products they sell. Online ammo sellers. Websites like Ammo-to-Go, Cheaper Than Dirt, MidwayUSA, and Scott's Ammo offer wide ranges of calibers and bullet weights, as well as the aforementioned bullet types. They also often offer military surplus at reduced cost, and bulk purchases can further reduce the cost. To get a quick overview of the pricing of online bullets, go to ammoseek.com and enter the caliber you are looking for. They will give you a listing of prices from numerous online ammo sources. Reloaders. Although people may feel like it is a gamble to buy ammo from a reloader, there are some advantages, particularly with special loads like subsonic ammunition for noise suppression. The main issue, when dealing with a reloader is being familiar with their process. Do they use brass in good condition? Do they accurately meter the power charge? In other words, can you depend on a reloader to produce quality ammunition?

"['start preparing for your car design career in high school', 'decide what area of automotive design interests you most', 'build a design portfolio', 'choose the right college program for you']",How to Become an Automobile Designer," Art and design classes are obvious classes to take to develop your drawing skills, but as an automobile designer, you also need fluency physics and mathematics to craft lightweight cars with low wind resistance. You also need to develop your writing and computer skills with English and computer classes.   Because the automotive design business is becoming an international business, knowledge of 1 or more foreign languages may be beneficial as well.; , Automobile designers can work in 1 of 3 areas: exterior design, interior design, or color/trim design.   Exterior designers decide what the outside of the vehicle looks like. Automotive exterior designers sketch designs, convert them into digital format, and then sculpt their designs into clay. Interior designers focus on making the vehicle interior comfortable for the driver and passengers and placing the controls and creature comforts in the places most accessible to the vehicle occupants without affecting safety. Interior designers also sketch their designs on paper and computer and then sculpt them in clay. Color/trim designers decide what materials (metal, wood grain, leather, fabric, carpeting) are to be used on the inside and outside of the vehicle to make it most visually appealing and comfortable. Color/trim designers are primarily researchers; they don't build models, although they may construct computer simulations of their design ideas.  , Because automotive design schools are so competitive, you'll need to have a portfolio of design concepts to show your potential. This portfolio can be either in hard copy or in digital format, depending on the requirements of the school you plan to attend.   If your high school lacks the classes and resources to help you build your design portfolio, you may want to consider an associate's industrial design degree from a community college to build a suitable portfolio.  , You have several options to pursue college training to become an automobile designer:   You can go for a bachelor's degree in industrial design, and then either obtain a graduate degree in transportation engineering/automotive design or land an entry-level position in industrial design and use that experience to springboard to an automobile designer position. There are several hundred college-level industrial design programs around the world. You can go for a bachelor's degree as an automotive engineer and try to use your experience to become an automobile designer. This can be a harder path, as most car companies have about 20 automotive engineers for every designer, and most automotive engineers are more logical than creative, making the change in mindset difficult. You can attend an automotive design school with an undergraduate program. There are about 20 such worldwide. You can follow earning your bachelor's degree with going for your master's. You can get your bachelor's degree in graphic design, furniture design, architectural design, or interior design and then go for a master's in automobile design. This path would be appropriate if you're making a career change from one design field to another. Regardless of which path you choose, look for a school that offers computer-aided drafting (CAD) courses and has connections to the automotive design departments of 1 or more automakers. You can also look for a school as close to where you presently live as possible, although this may not be a practical requirement if you wish to attend an undergraduate automotive design program.

LDs can affect the way the brain processes audio, visual, or speech-related information or stimuli.   LDs are the result of neurological-based problems that affect the way that the brain receives, processes, stores, and responds to information: the brain's cognitive functioning. LDs are not curable, they are lifelong. But, they can be managed with the proper help.; , One in every five Americans is diagnosed with a LD. Unfortunately, because each LD affects the cognitive area of the brain, symptoms tend to over-lap, making it quite difficult for even the trained professional to identify. For example, poor-handwriting skills can be the result of difficulties processing symbols (dyslexia); or from poor spatial organization skills (dysgraphia). The most common LDs are:   Dyslexia is a reading disability that affects how one interprets sounds, letters and words.It can affect general vocabulary skills as well as one's reading speed and efficiency. Symptoms of dyslexia include late speech, difficulty with handwriting, and difficulty rhyming words. Dyscalculia affects an individual's ability to process numbers, and can manifest itself as a problem with memorization skills, as well as a difficulty sequencing patterns or numbers.Symptoms of dyscalculia include difficulty counting and memorizing arithmetic concepts. Dysgraphia is a LD of writing, and can be the result of either a physical motor in-efficiency, or a mental difficulty in understanding and processing certain forms of information.Individuals with dysgraphia tend to demonstrate poor handwriting skills, illegible and/or irregular writing, and have difficulties communicating through the written form.  , Although each LD affects the brain in a different way, there are, however, general symptoms that can help indicate whether-or-not an individual has a disability of either the audio, visual, or speech type. These symptoms include:Trouble spelling. Avoidance of reading and writing. Difficulty summarizing. Trouble with open-ended questions. Poor memory. Difficulty with abstract concepts. Trouble expressing ideas. Mispronunciation. Easily distracted. Mix up right/left or poor sense of direction. Trouble following directions or completing tasks., Take well-detailed notes if necessary, and look for the most obvious symptoms of a LD--poor memorization, bad social skills, frustration with reading and/or writing.   Do you or your child perform daily tasks in a different way each time? This can be an indicator of a LD.Do this over an extended period of time.  , These symptoms may not necessarily be the result of a LD, but may be caused by other conditions affecting you or your child. In many cases, individuals demonstrate the symptoms of a LD but do not actually have any disorder. Instead, these individuals are being affected by social, financial, personal, or general living conditions that make it difficult to learn or remain focused.These ""learning problems"" are not considered disorders.It is very difficult to distinguish between learning disorders and learning problems.  , If you do not believe that the symptoms are being caused by any outside or social conditions, then the next step is to take a quiz or questionnaire. Many are available online. These tests will help you assess whether-or-not you should seek any further screening.    Here is a test that you can take at home.  , On the contrary, individuals with LDs typically demonstrate an average to above average intelligence.Charles Schwab and Whoopi Goldberg have been diagnosed with LDs, and many suspect that Albert Einstein may have had one as well.   Celebrities Tom Cruise, Danny Glover and Jay Leno all have dyslexia, and have actively campaigned to raise awareness for the disability. Historians and researchers suspect that these historical figures may have also had some form of learning disability: George Patton, Walt Disney, Leonardo Da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson and Napoleon Bonaparte.

Then just walk away and ignore the puppy. Social isolation and time outs can be an effective form of punishment for a pack animal.You can also yelp when your puppy bites too hard. It might seem silly but puppies in a litter will cry out if a sibling accidentally bites too hard. Yelping when your puppy lays teeth on your will give feedback to very young puppies about what is acceptable playing and what isn't.Teach children not to shriek, run or flap their hands because this will engage the puppy’s natural prey instincts and add to the problem. Children should remain calm and keep their hands closed and close to their bodies.; , Before you start playing with your puppy, spray a taste deterrent on areas of your body and clothes that your puppy likes to play rough with. When your puppy starts biting you, stop moving and wait for him to react to the taste deterrent. Once your puppy stops biting, praise him and continue playing. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water to get the material off your hands.Taste deterrents include: “Bitter Apple,” “Vick’s Vapor Rub,” or white vinegar. Use these on your hands to make them taste unpleasant. Contrary to a previous post, please note that tea tree oil can cause temporary paralysis in dogs; use products that are tested as safe for dogs/animals. , When he has calmed down, gently talk to him and stroke him. Keep your hand away from his mouth. Start playing again and avoid getting the puppy excited. This time, use toys instead of your hands to get your puppy engaged. Start playing fetch, so that you are tossing toys away from you and using the puppy’s prey drive for positive fun. Playing with toys can be used as a training reward or break and keeps your hands away from the puppy's teeth.Some trainers suggest playing tug-of-war with your puppy. The puppy learns that the game is fun, but is also controlled by you, the human at the other end of the toy. The fun will stop if the rules of the game aren't honored, keeping everyone safe., Never play roughly with a puppy that bites. Rough play will only encourage this behavior and strongly establish it in the puppy's mind. Never use your hands as toys. You should also closely watch children playing around or with the puppy. Kids are not equipped to train a puppy and injuries can happen.Don't let children play tug with the puppy unless an adult is present, the puppy fully understands the rules, and only if the puppy’s size does not pose a risk to the child during the game.  , In cases where biting is exceptionally strong or persistent, keep a water spray bottle handy. Accompany your firm ""NO!"" with a squirt of water in puppy's face to interrupt the behavior. Take care to set the nozzle to spray and not jet. You just want to startle the puppy, not harm him.Be aware that the puppy will associate the water spray with you, and this could make him wary of you at other times.   Never threaten the puppy with the squirt bottle or create fear. You also don’t want to create a situation where the puppy only behaves if the squirt bottle is in your hand.  , Always praise good behavior with lots of gentle love and cuddles. Use rewards effectively to reinforce good behavior. For example, if your dog successfully responds to your request to drop a toy, say, ""yes!,"" or ""good boy!"" Verbal rewards work well when you're playing and may have your hands full of toys.Remember, you are now the puppy's parent. It's your responsibility to encourage him to become a happy, healthy, well-adjusted family member.  , It's normal for puppies to bite as they develop and grow. Usually, they learn about not biting from other members of their pack, including adult dogs. Puppies learn by playing with other pack mates about when to avoid causing serious damaging through biting. If puppies don't learn to control or stop biting, the other dogs will punish the puppy more severely, possibly by biting the puppy to cause injury.If the puppy does learn easily from his pack mates, they'll become more forceful and clear about biting behavior until the puppy behaves in a manner acceptable to other members of its pack.  , If you allow puppy biting, it may get out of control and your puppy will not learn to control his bite. This can lead to serious behavioral issues when your puppy reaches adulthood. If you suspect your puppy is biting out of fear or anger, talk with an animal behavioral therapist, who may be able to help.It is not acceptable for puppies to bite people, or other animals, unless they are in true physical danger and need to defend themselves.  , If you're starting a training program with the help of a qualified trainer, consider muzzling your puppy with a basket muzzle. Your puppy will quickly learn to stop nipping or biting with the help of the muzzle, but muzzling is not recommended if you don't have a clear understanding of the training approach and goals. If the muzzle isn't introduced and used properly, your puppy can actually become more dangerous to people, especially those trying to put the muzzle on the puppy.   Rewarding the puppy by giving it a treat after wearing the muzzle can help the dog associate the muzzle with something good. This makes it less likely to be wary of you or aggressive, and it makes the whole process easier for both you and the dog. Never leave children unattended and unsupervised with dogs, even ones that seem “safe”. You may need to isolate the dog and/or crate him when a knowledgeable adult cannot be present.

"['talk with the senior citizen', ""match a dog to the senior's mobility level"", 'calculate the cost', ""select a dog that works in the senior's living situation"", 'develop a plan for the dog if the person passes away']",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for Senior Citizens1," When choosing a dog for a senior citizen it is important to discuss what he or she wants in a dog. This pet is for someone else, so their wishes should be central to any choice that you make.   Discuss what the person's ideal dog looks like, what they think they can do physically in relation to dog care, and if they have any reservations or concerns about getting a dog. Adopting a dog is a big decision that comes with a lot of responsibilities. This means that you should make sure that the senior citizen is excited and ready to care for a dog. Getting a dog as a surprise for a senior citizen is not a good idea.; , You need to consider the senior citizen's physical strength and agility when picking out a dog for them. A senior citizen that is active and mobile can probably handle a dog that needs daily walks and play time and is relatively large. However, if the senior citizen does not have a lot of strength and cannot walk very far, you will need to find a dog that will not overwhelm them physically and can get its exercise inside the house.Having realistic expectations of what the senior citizen can and can't do for a dog is very important. Getting a dog that requires too much physical activity for them will set them up for trouble. If the senior citizen has severe medical issues or is at risk for falls, then getting a dog for them may not be the best idea. The dog may put them at an increased risk of falls or injury due to minor scratches from playing with the pet.  , When trying to choose a dog you should also take cost into consideration. If the senior citizen has a limited income and doesn't want to spend very much money on the dog and dog care, then a smaller dog might be a good option.The lower cost of a small dog is due to the fact that a smaller dog costs less to feed. Over its lifetime, feeding a small dog versus a large dog can save you thousands of dollars. However, the cost of grooming can increase the cost of a small dog tremendously. Keep in mind that regardless of size, every dog will need routine veterinary care such as immunizations, blood tests, preventative medications such as heartworm tablets, dental care (especially for small dogs), and possibly even emergency treatment.  , Whatever living situation the senior citizen is in, they can probably have a dog. For example, a little dog that is content in a small space will be good for a senior citizen living in a small apartment, while a large, energetic dog will not.   If the senior citizen is living in a care facility, such as assisted living, there are usually rules about whether pets are allowed or not. In many cases, there are restrictions limiting the size of dogs allowed in the facility.  , Although it is not pleasant to think about, it is possible that the dog will outlive their senior citizen owner. If this happens, make sure there is a plan in place for who will care for the dog so that the dog does not end up homeless or being cared for by someone who does not want a dog.  For example, is there a family member or close friend who is willing and able to care for the dog if the person passes away? Making these arrangements can offer the senior citizen dog owner some peace of mind about the well-being of their dog after they are gone.

"['locate the name of the country that made the wine', 'check the quality designation', ""look for the year to learn the wine's vintage"", 'find the name of the specific region of origin', 'identify the region', 'find the bottle shape that matches the wine you want']",How to Read a Wine Label1," The label will tell you where the wine was made; if it was produced in specific countries, it is an Old World wine. When someone refers to a wine as an “Old World” wine, this means it was produced in one of the countries that are thought to be the first countries to make wine. Some people prefer Old World wines simply because they appreciate the long history that went into the making of these wines.Old World wines tend to be lower in alcohol content, and lighter and more restrained in taste – although this is not true of every wine. Countries that are considered to be the birthplace of winemaking include: France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Austria, Croatia, Romania, Georgia, Hungary, Switzerland, Israel, and Lebanon.; , Old World wines are regulated and graded, and each country has its own system of rating its wines. In general, they rank from “superior quality” wines to “table” wines, which are the lowest-rated, everyday wines. The quality designations of several European wine countries, from highest to lowest quality, are as follows:France: AOC (Appellation of Controlled Origin), VDQS (Wines of Superior Quality), Vins de Pays (Country Wine), Vins de Table (Table Wine). Germany: QmP (Quality Wine with Special Attributes), QbA (Quality Wine from Specific Appellations), Deutscher Landwein (Superior Table Wine), Deutscher Tafelwein (Simple Table Wine). Italy: DOCG (Denomination of Controlled and Guaranteed Origin), DOC (Denomination of Controlled Origin), IGT (Typical Geographical Indication), Vini di tavola (Table Wines). Spain: DO (Denomination of Origin), DOC (Denomination of Qualified Origin). Portugal has only one classification, indicating a good quality wine: DO (Denomination of Controlled Origin).  , Most wines are vintage wines, and the label will tell you the year that the wine was made. Vintage wines are made of grapes from the same harvest year, and are usually designed to be aged. Non-vintage wines are made from a blend of grapes from different harvest years, and are not intended to be aged.Look on the front of the label for a year, which is usually written out completely (for example, 1989, 2007, 1967). If it is not part of the main label, it might be printed separately on a sticker on the bottle neck. If the year is not listed on the front of the bottle, it might be on the back label.  , This information should be listed prominently on the front of the label. In Europe, most wine makers label their bottles according to the region they come from, not the type of grape. Vintners assume the buyer will be savvy enough to know that “Red Burgundy” (Burgundy being a region in France) means “Pinot Noir.” Different types of grapes are grown in different regions, producing different types of wine.In France, the region Alsace produces fruity, Germanic wines; the Bordeaux region produces Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot; the Champagne region produces sparkling white wines; Beaujolais produces a light red wine that is released in November each year and is designed to be consumed right away. Chianti is not a type of grape, it is a region of Italy that makes Chianti wine.  , High quality wines are often extremely specific when describing the region that produced them. Generally speaking, the more specific the location named, the more famous the vineyard.Meursault in Burgundy is a village that is known for producing high quality Chardonnay. A wine label listing this town may be of higher quality than one that simply names “Burgundy.” Right outside of Bordeaux is a small town called Saint-Emilion, that is famous for its Merlot-blends. A wine label that specifies Saint-Emilion is likely to contain a higher quality wine than one that simply lists the region Bordeaux. The Rheingau is a region of Germany that produces the best Riesling wines, and is considered the birthplace of German wines.  , European wines are bottled according to type, so the shape of the bottle will give you a clue as to its contents. If you're looking for a specific type of wine, you don't need to read the labels if the bottle isn't appropriate to that type of wine.Straight, high-shouldered bottles contain Bordeaux wines – green glass for red wines, clear glass for white. (The shoulder is the point where the bottle diameter increases.) In France, Burgundy, the Loire, and the Rhone use gently-shouldered bottles. Outside of France, this type of bottle sometimes contains Chardonnay or Pinot Noir. Tall, slender bottles are usually from Germany and Alsace, and tend to contain Riesling, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, or the sweet dessert wine Gewurztraminer.

Usually, the scale is a comparison to another food, such as pure glucose.Carbohydrates are ranked according to the way that they affect an individual’s blood glucose levels. The higher a food's glycemic index, the more it affects blood sugar and insulin levels. When the carbohydrates in a food cause a person’s blood sugar to spike, it is considered a high-glycemic food. Low-glycemic foods do not have a significant effect on blood sugar, and foods that fall somewhere in the middle are considered moderate-glycemic foods.GI is actually measured by feeding the food to 10 healthy adults (who had fasted) and checking their blood sugar periodically. The GI is based on the averages.; , This scale is primarily meant to help people with diseases like diabetes. Utilizing the glycemic index is very helpful for women suffering from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome too, as these women typically have insulin resistance. This causes the woman's body to resist the effects of insulin, causing prolonged blood sugar spikes and eventually diabetes. Following a low-glycemic index diet can significantly lower blood sugar spikes in these individuals. It is also helpful for people who want to lower their carbohydrate intake or who want to lose weight., Because low-glycemic foods are absorbed more slowly, they help you feel fuller for longer. Therefore, they help control your appetite., Many factors can affect a food's GI. For instance, processing can increase a food's GI, such as a grape, which has a lower GI, compared to grape juice, which has a higher GI.Other factors that can affect the GI are how long you cook the food (pasta that is cooked longer has a higher GI), the type (some types of rice have a higher GI than others), and how ripe a piece of fruit is., GI numbers are only assigned to foods that have carbohydrates in them.Therefore, foods such as oil or meat do not have a GI number., Generally, foods that are rated 55 or less are considered low-glycemic foods, while medium foods are in the 56 to 69 GI range. Anything above that is considered high., The easiest way to find low-glycemic foods is to check glycemic indexes. They will offer you a wide variety of low-glycemic foods., Whole grains fall into the category of ""complex carbohydrates,"" and they almost always have a lower GI than more processed varieties. Whole wheat varieties of bread and pasta, oatmeal, muesli, barley, and lentils all have low GIs.Beans are also low on the glycemic scale. For instance, black beans, navy beans, and kidney beans all come in at about 30., Though a couple of fruits rank higher on the GI scale, eating fruits and non-starchy vegetables are usually a safe bet for low-glycemic foods.For instance, watermelon, grapes, and bananas rank relatively high at 72, 59, and 62, respectively.Grapefruit, apples, peaches, pears, and oranges all rank below 50. Grapefruit comes in at the lowest at 25., The more processed your food is, the more likely it is to have a higher GI.Of course, this rule applies to foods like whole wheat bread versus white bread, but it also applies to foods like whole fruit versus fruit juices., If you prefer hot or cold cereal for breakfast, pick one that incorporates or is mainly whole grains, such as oatmeal. You can also find a number of cold cereals that are composed of whole grains. Try topping it with a low-glycemic fresh fruit, such as peaches., These foods, such as instant rice often have a higher GI, so stick to foods you cook yourself.Instead of instant rice, cook brown rice or converted long grain rice for yourself, both of which have lower GIs., For instance, choose whole wheat bread instead of white bread. Try whole wheat pasta instead of regular pasta. These choices will help lower the GI of the foods you eat.You can use these foods the same as you always do, in moderation of course.  , For instance, instead of eating a package of chips, try snacking on a handful of nuts. Instead of cookies, eat a piece of fruit as a snack.Hummus is also very low on the scale and loaded with protein. Eat with some low-glycemic vegetables, such as celery or bell pepper., Foods with more fiber have a lower GI-index. Read labels to help you decide if foods have enough fiber. You need 25 to 30 grams per day.Whole grains are typically higher in fiber, thus allowing for better blood sugar regulation. The higher the fiber content in food, the less impact it will have on blood sugar.  , Even when eating low-glycemic foods, you should combine those foods with low-fat proteins such as fish. This combination helps you feel fuller longer and lowers the GI for the meal., Foods that carry a high-glycemic index rank at 70 or above on the glycemic index.   Learn about low-glycemic foods (0-55) that can replace high-glycemic foods in some of your favorite recipes, such as subbing zucchini noodles for regular noodles. By substituting the healthier glycemic option, you will find that you can still enjoy many of your favorite dishes without causing a spike in your blood sugar levels. For moderate glycemic index foods, eliminate anything that ranks between 56 and 69 that you can do without. Keep only the foods that you must have, and consume them in moderation. Continue to enjoy your favorite foods by eating them in their healthiest form. For example, substitute a fresh peach for a cup of canned peaches.  , Fruits and vegetables are high in fiber and thus, have a minimal impact on blood sugar. Focus on fruits that have skins/seeds, such as berries. These are highest in fiber and pack the best nutritional punch. Vegetables are all highly fibrous, but cruciferous vegetables are especially beneficial. At mealtimes, make sure at least half of your meal is fruits and non-starchy vegetables. Try a fresh, green salad with vegetable toppings, such as bell pepper, cucumber, and tomato, or eat a light mix of fresh peaches, pears, and apples.",1018,"['glycemic index', 'low-glycemic foods', 'snacks', 'high-glycemic load', 'meal', 'protein', 'whole grain', 'fruits', 'less-processed foods', 'pick whole grains', 'instant foods', 'low-glycemic food', 'breakfast', 'whole grains', 'foods', 'fiber-rich foods', 'carbohydrates', 'non-starchy vegetables']"
"['never quit!', 'find shelter', 'realistically assess your situation', 'gather your resources', 'know your ""enemy""', 'know when to keep moving and when to stay put', 'make a plan and stick with it']",How to Survive a Living Hell," In order to have any chance at all of surviving to ""tell the tale,"" you must understand that your attitude is the single most important ally that you are likely to have. Above all, your will to live and to ""beat the odds"" will sustain you even when your situation seems utterly hopeless. This basic principle holds true for every situation in which a person is forced to live in a dangerous or outright hostile environment. It doesn't matter if you're in a combat zone, lost in the jungle, or if you've crashed your plane into the side of a mountain or find yourself in an abusive relationship, sheer determination is what separates the survivors from the ""statistics"".; , A warm, dry place not only keeps you out of the elements and gives you a somewhat secure place in which to plan your next move, but also provides many psychological benefits.  , It is imperative that you remain calm and think! If you let panic overrule common sense and critical thinking, then you set yourself up for a series of mistakes in a situation that leaves little room for error.  , Take stock of yourself and your surroundings. Surviving for a long period of time in adverse conditions means conserving your resources and knowing where and how to gather more. Resources can also include allies (anyone available to you who is trustworthy and willing to help). Don't isolate yourself, accept assistance from allies if it is available. This applies especially if the ""enemy"" is a human or large animal.  , In most survival scenarios the elements (i.e. heat, cold, predators, terrain, etc.), along with hunger and thirst are the antagonists. In other cases, such as combat or an abusive relationship, the ""enemy"" is an actual person or group. In all cases you must learn as much as you can about what or whom you are dealing with.  , This is the tricky part because of the danger inherent in both of these courses of action. If you are relatively sure that someone at least has some idea of where you are then you might want to stay put so you will be easier to find. If you are unsure, then your best course of action might be to strike out on your own and move toward a location that will offer you the best chance of being rescued. You can literally ""what if"" yourself to death about this so trust your instincts and make a decision. Right or wrong, at least you will be doing something to save your own life.  , There are many ways to do this. One way is to come up with three workable plans incorporating the information and resources gathered in steps three through six and then work through a list of pros and cons for each plan. Pick the most feasible of the three and file the other two away as back-up plans. However, it is vitally important that you remember to remain flexible! No matter how good your plan is, it is likely that you will have to adjust to unforeseen circumstances.  ",519,"['stick', 'shelter', 'enemy', 'resources', 'plan', 'situation']"

Wait at least 15 minutes for the glass to warm up.   Never attempt to try to defrost the windshield using water, hot, cold, or warm. Using warm or hot water can cause the glass to break due to thermal shock due to temperature change. In very cold climates, cold water can also freeze on the windshield, making your troubles even worse. While your car is warming up, make sure no ice, snow, or other materials are blocking the vehicle tailpipe. Remove any blockage to prevent the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning. If you drive in a very snowy area, wait until the ice has noticeably begun to melt before proceeding to the next step. It may take thicker ice well over 15 minutes to sufficiently begin melting.; , This will dissolve the ice via chemical reaction rather than melting it with heat. The ions in salt also lower the freezing point of water, making it difficult for water to refreeze. Apply the saltwater sparingly to your windshield since heavy salt exposure may cause damage to the glass.While normal table salt will suffice in above freezing temperatures, you may want to consider using road salt, which is commonly shoveled onto residential sidewalks to quickly melt ice and reduce hazards. Road salt has a different chemical composition that makes it more effective at freezing temperatures.  , Make a 2:1 rubbing alcohol to water solution and fill a spray bottle with it. Spray the solution onto all desired windows.   You can also add a few drops of dish soap to the solution.Adding chemicals is similar to adding salt and lowers the freezing point of water. This will melt the ice more quickly than warm water. Unlike the saltwater solution, the alcohol solution can be sprayed liberally without risking damage to your car.  , Most commercial formulas work well but tend to be costly. Like scrapers, these formulas shouldn't be hard to find at your local car supply store. Almost every auto store has a section dedicated to de-icers.   Examples of popular de-icing agents include ""Valvoline Deicer"" and ""Prestone Spray-on Windshield De-icer."", Once you have applied your chosen solution, wipe away the liquid and ice from your windshield and car.   After a minute or two, your saltwater or alcohol solution should begin to melt the ice. Keep in mind, however, that the ice will only be partly melted. It will need to be brushed away in order to improve visibility., You should purchase one for your car well in advance, then leave it in the trunk to handle ice if you have no other supplies around. Push it into the windshield and use short, powerful strokes to chip the ice away.Ice scrapers are specialized tools for scraping ice from your windshield. Typically, they are plastic, and have a large, flat, dull blade on one end, and a handle on the other, sometimes combined with a brush. They can be purchased up at most auto stores and car supply stores. In cold climates, these will also be available in most large retail stores, hardware stores, gas stations, even grocery stores. In a pinch you can use a standard squeegee to scrape ice, although this is not as effective. Scraper heads are made from plastic rather than rubber, and this makes them more sturdy when scrubbing away residue.

Have a thorough study about what happened in any country; any kind of murder,theft or robbery, any kind of strange case known. If the case never closed, you could make it end in any way you please.; , He or she could be tough, perceptive or patient, or perhaps all three. Being thorough in this step can help you write a believable story based on a complete and well-rounded main character, so some suggestions for things to consider are offered here:   Think of the basics. Male or female? What is the detective's name? How old are they? What do they look like (hair color, eye color, and skin tone)? Where are they from? Where are they living when your story starts? How did they become part of the story? Are they victims? Are they the cause of the problems in your story? Develop a family for your character. Parents? Siblings? Significant other? Children? Other relations? Sociably problematic groups? A character which may know everything but has disappear... Make it as normal or as quirky as you want! What kind of life do they live? Are they famous, or are they just starting out? Are they unexpectedly smart? What kind of mysteries do they solve? (Murder, theft, a combination, other kinds?) Develop their tastes. Favorite sentence to say? What is their favorite color? Place to be? Soft drink? Book? TV show? Movie? Music? Meal? What are they afraid of? How practical are they? Do they wear a scent, and if so, what scent? Strong, soft, nice or not pleasant? Develop their relationships. Do they have a lot of friends? A best friend? Are they romantic? What first impression do they make? Do they like children? Do they like smokers? Do they like reading? How do they dress? Do they use makeup or hair dye? How about piercings or tattoos? How attractive are they, and how attractive do they think they are? Is there something they wish they could change, or something they are particularly happy with? How much time do they spend thinking about physical appearance? Though this may seem like a lot to worry about for a short story, having your characters developed to the fullest is an essential part of writing a good story and to making the character believable.  ,   Use Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? questions to get you started: Who committed the crime and who did they do it to? What was the crime? When did it happen (morning, evening, afternoon, dead of night)? Where did it happen? Why did they do it? How did they do it? Use this skeleton to more fully sketch out a summary of your plot, with as many details as you can think of at this point. By now, plot ideas will be boiling around in your brain. Don't even worry about putting them in order, just write them down somewhere so that you don't forget them later!  , This is an especially important part of your story, so take the time to really develop it fully. Try to describe every single detail so that the reader can picture the crime scene. What does it look like? Is it different by day than by night?.  , Go back and look at the questions you used for forming the protagonist, and develop the antagonist's personality just as fully. In particular, think about their relationship to the protagonist.  , Make sure you have all of your ducks in a row before you begin writing.   Make a list of the suspects. Detail their basic personality. Do the same for witnesses and any other characters. Be sure to have in mind how the mystery is solved!  , The detective work must be good. Develop how your protagonist ultimately solves the case, keeping their personality and qualities in mind. Make sure it isn't cheesy or too obvious.  , Start with an introductory chapter or two, to introduce the characters and setting. Then make the crime scene happen.  , For example: ""Annie entered the office. She was a tall woman with thin legs and hands. Her face looks like a diamond..."". Make sure that you give the reader a vivid picture of each character.  , The more suspense you insert into the unfolding of the story, the more interesting the story will be. Make the protagonist get stuck in a couple of impossible-seeming situations and obstacles. Don't make the mystery too easy to solve!  , Be sure the ending is clear on who committed the crime and why, and how it was solved. There is nothing worse than leaving a mystery story extremely confused about what was going on!  , Rewrite as needed, and reword dull passages to make them more interesting. Cut out as many unnecessary fillers as you can.

Sussex rabbits require human companionship to thrive. They are also prone to overheating, hypothermia, and attacks by predators.Even if you are certain that your Sussex rabbit is safe in her cage, rabbits are known to have heart attacks from fear. Keeping your Sussex rabbit outside may also cause her to become antisocial.; , There are wide variety of indoor cages and hutches for rabbits. You can house your rabbit in a room that is rabbit-proofed, keep your rabbit in a puppy playpen, or purchase a rabbit condo.Whatever you choose, make sure that your Sussex rabbit has plenty of space to move around.   The minimum length of an indoor hutch and run should be four feet, but five feet is better. The width should be about two feet and the enclosure should be high enough so that your Sussex rabbit can stand up on her hind legs without her ears touching the top.Do not get a wire bottom cage because it can hurt your Sussex rabbit’s feet. Look for a cage that has a solid metal bottom or cover the bottom of your rabbit’s cage with plywood., Make sure the floor of your Sussex rabbit’s cage is covered with at least two to three inches of bedding. There are numerous substances that you can use for bedding, such as straw (warm and soft), paper pulp (recycled material, safe and high absorbent), and shredded cardboard.Do not use sawdust because it can irritate your rabbit. Never use cedar or pine shavings in your Sussex rabbit’s as bedding or in your rabbit’s litter box. These materials can cause your Sussex rabbit to develop respiratory and liver problems., Rabbits feel more secure if they have a place to retreat to when they feel frightened or stressed. You can provide your rabbit with a hiding place by putting a cardboard box or wooden box with a hole cut out of it into your rabbit’s cage.If you have more than one rabbit, then you will need to provide a separate hiding place for each rabbit.  , To prevent your Sussex rabbit from urinating and defecating all over her cage, place a small litter box in a corner of your rabbit’s cage. Then, put a few sheets of newspaper into the litter box and layer hay on top of the newspaper. Clean the litter box daily to keep your rabbit’s cage from smelling.You can always move your rabbit’s litter box to a different corner if she does not seem to be suing it where it is. Move it to the corner that she uses to urinate and defecate. Try placing a couple of litter boxes in your house so your Sussex rabbit can use them when she is out of the cage. Be aware that rabbits pass two different types of pellets. One type is small and dry and the other type is larger and sticky, called a cecotrophy. The cecotrophy contains food that has been partially digested but that still contains nutrition. Your Sussex rabbit will re-eat these. Never remove cecotropes from your rabbit’s litter box or cage.

Delivery needs to be 'open' - freely accessible, no password protection - and ideally editable (at the very least, able to be copied).   You do not need to always make a new website: you could develop and upload a text-based document; create a bank of new images in an existing space; edit an existing space, like a wiki; create a closed resource but share how you made it openly through social media; or you could develop a new webpage. These are just a few examples.  , Good learning resources often take a lot of time to develop through reflection and sourcing content. This is especially true with OERs, as finding open content - or authoring your own images and text, etc. - can take a lot of time. That said, it's well worth the effort.   Often you will find yourself stumbling upon something new and unexpected through your development journey. In turn, this may inspire you to decide to completely change what you initially had in mind. No worries, just run with it! The time you had spent up to then was not wasted, it helped you achieve your new and exciting plan.  , Things can seem scary, then you put flowers in it! Be prepared to take risks and try something new––you have nothing to lose but a lot to gain from giving a new idea a go.  , Learning resources are everywhere and so are ideas for new ones. Jump in at the deep end and fully immerse yourself in different spaces and resources. For inspiration and potentially sourcing content, check out the following ideas:   Blogs Mailing lists Stumble Upon websites MOOCs OER and CC content banks and search engines Online articles Social media … etc. (often the first jump is the hardest, then it's a lot of fun!)  , Do not feel like you have to make everything from scratch - there are loads of great ideas and resources out there, available for use in a new context. It is important to note that content can be used in various ways:   If forming part of the core activity, open access content can be pulled out and reused directly, partially or simply be inspiring; There is also the opportunity to use or sign-post to other non-CC content, providing you have obtained the author's direct permission to use it in this context (and there is no harm in asking); However, should the content be supplementary to the core activity (for example, you might also like to look at this link) the sign-posted content is not necessarily required to hold a CC license too (however, should high-volumes of traffic be expected, such as for use in a MOOC, it is polite and thoughtful to give the author a heads-up, as it could be sitting on a personally-hosted server.)  , Not everything on the internet is an open resource - just because it appears open, does not mean there is an open license to use it. This is particularly true for images, where the image may be found in multiple places with different licenses available. It is important to try to find the original image (or at least show that you made every effort to find it) rather than simply choosing the version with the most open attribution! If in doubt, try a different image.   Start from a position of open. Using creative commons search engines to source images where you do not hold the license personally makes the development of open content easier (although do double-check the licenses just to be sure!). Keep an eye on the particular license of the content, for example, share-alike, which stipulates you must use the exact same license for the final work the resource is incorporated into (more information available in the video)  , If someone has taken the time to create a(n open) resource, acknowledge their effort through attribution. Even if it is not a requirement of the license, it is a good habit to develop and a nice way to say thank you. It also makes it easier for others to use the resource after you.  , So you've immersed yourself in exciting resources, you've been inspired, you have a list of content to use - now all you've go to do is link it back to your vision for the learning activity, applying all the steps and insight previously gained. Again, leave yourself plenty of time!  , Don't forget to apply an open license to what you produce - Creativecommons.org helps you build a suitable CC license for your content, which can be embedded into your resource in lots of different forms. Displaying an open-license badge signifies to other users that your content is part of a growing community of open practice and resources. Lovely!

Knowing what to expect ahead of time can help you navigate these stresses and stay on time. A routine can be very helpful.  , Set the alarm so that you have enough time to fully prepare for the day. Your wake up time should allow you to complete your routine without feeling rushed or panicked. At the same time, you shouldn't wake up so early that you will be fatigued.   Avoid pressing the snooze button. The temptation to sleep just five more minutes can be irresistible. Resist it! It will make you late. Worse still, it often leads to multiple snoozing. Set two alarms if you are a compulsive, multiple snoozer. Put one out of reach, maybe even across the room!, Between showering, dressing, eating, and putting on makeup, you won't have the luxury of extra time. Consider tracking yourself during these activities to see how long you spend on each one.Keep grooming at a reasonable minimum. Doing your makeup and hair and dressing is a time killer, and your ambitions to be punctual may well die in front of the bathroom mirror. This doesn't mean neglect your yourself. Just resist the urge to be perfect. There may be occasions when you should look your absolute best. On those days, plan to spend the extra time. Otherwise aim for efficiency., Mornings ought to be about luxury, about watching the news, reading the paper, checking your texts, or nursing a cup of tea or coffee. Most of us can only afford a small indulgence, unfortunately. Resist the urge. It will cost you precious time.   Limit your morning television carefully. The local traffic and weather should be enough until you can catch the 5 o'clock broadcast. If you like to read the paper or the news online, leave it as a treat for the afternoon or between classes. It, like television, will wait for your homecoming.  , Many times a student has chased the school bus down the block at least once. Don't be that person. Be outside and at your stop on time. Missing your bus or carpool can set you back by a good twenty minutes or more, depending on where you live.  , It may be that your lateness comes from living in a full house - from daily confusion, chaos, and bottlenecks for space. Talk to your parents and siblings honestly and try to come up with a system.Take turns in the bathroom. The bathroom is prime real estate in the morning for washing, dressing, and tooth brushing. Establish time limits for its use, negotiate slots, or organize it better.If you have siblings, help your parents. Your mom and dad may have the best intentions but struggle to get your younger brother, or your teenage sister, up and moving. Be considerate. Try to make their job easier and lend a hand.  , Let the ticking of the clock be your constant reminder. Keep clocks in every room if you can, so that it always possible to see the hour.

Put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds. You don't want to get the water too hot, as that could burn your hands or face. You'll also need a washcloth to apply it to your face.   As an alternative, you can warm up a hot pack that’s typically used for injuries in the microwave to achieve a similar result.; , You want the washcloth to absorb the warm water. Therefore, all you need to do is dunk the washcloth in the cup, and let it sit for a few seconds., Once the washcloth has absorbed most of the water, take it out. Hold it over the sink so you don't get water everywhere, and then wring it out so it's just damp rather than dripping.  , Fold or roll the washcloth so it easily fits over your eyebrows. Hold it there for a couple of minutes. The washcloth should stay warm the whole time. After a couple of minutes, take it off, and proceed with plucking your eyebrows as normal.If you’re using a hot pack instead, hold it to your eyebrows in this same way.   The idea behind this method is the heat helps the pores open up. In turn, the hairs you are plucking will come out more easily. That makes the whole process less painful for you.  , Another way to make the process less painful is to pluck your eyebrows after a shower. While you're in the shower, the steam opens up your pores, and as noted in the previous step, having open pores makes the process of plucking much easier and not as painful., Unless you stay on top of sharpening them and cleaning them with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball, using an old pair of tweezers will make it harder to grasp hairs.If you can't grab the hair effectively, you might accidentally get your skin. Try picking up a new pair of tweezers to make it easier.Don't pick sharp, pointed tweezers. Instead, opt for a slanted style that comes to a point but has an edge where the tweezers meet. Having an edge makes it easier to pick up hairs., You can apply a numbing gel to your eyebrows. The numbing gel will numb your skin, making it less painful to pluck out hairs.For instance, a dental numbing gel meant for babies is a good one to try. Just use a cotton swab to dab the gel along your eyebrows. Wait for the skin to get numb before plucking.  , To help cool down any pain afterwards, add a bit of aloe vera gel to the area. The gel will help soothe skin, as well as help it heal from the irritation of plucking.Aloe vera gel can be purchased at almost any drugstore or grocery store. You can also use aloe vera from a plant. Simply break off a piece, and squeeze out the aloe vera to use. If you don't have aloe vera on hand, try an ice cube to numb your skin., Using your fingers, stretch the skin near your eyebrows so it's tight. Stretching the skin stretches the pores, making it easier to pluck out hairs. When it's easier, it's less painful., It's always best to grab the base of the hair rather than try to pull from the tip. The reason is your tweezers may slip off, and then you'll need to pull the hair again, causing extra pain. In addition, you might split a hair instead pulling it out properly., You should pluck hairs in the direction they grow to make it easier for them to come out. If you don't, the hair could split or break, meaning you need to go in for another go. You don't want to pluck each hair twice, as that's just more pain for you. This is a good rule of thumb for all types of hair removal.",660,"['new tweezers', 'washcloth', 'hot pack', 'shower', 'cup', 'numbing gel', 'skin', 'right direction', 'eyebrows', 'water', 'base']"

Take a deep breath, breathing all the way down to your belly, and breathing out slowly through your nose. Repeat this slow, deep breathing several times. Make sure your feet are placed firmly against the floor, so that you’re well-grounded.Bring to mind a positive visualization. For example, imagine yourself looking sleek and sexy on the dance floor, or someone attractive laughing at your sense of humor. Realize that no one’s paying attention to you, so there’s no need to feel self-conscious. After all, most people attending parties are also nervous. Repeat this process anytime you start to feel nervous at the party.; , You may be feeling terrified, but if you smile you’re more likely to look confident. Even if you don't know anyone else at the party, you can increase your social abilities through smiling. In addition, if you're feeling nervous, smiling can help to improve your mood, and reduce stress.People often respond to a smiling person with a smile of their own, which will make you feel even better. Even a slight smile will be enough to help your facial muscles relax, and your appearance seem less threatening to other party guests. When you look confident, you’ll start to feel confident.  , What kind of party is it? Social interactions will vary depending on the reason you’re gathered together. If you’re attending a frat party, you’ll need different social skills than you might at a Christmas carol party held by your mom’s church choir.Remember that other people may not know one another either. Considering the nature of the party, try to gauge how likely it is that many people may be making their first introductions.  , It will help you feel at ease to figure out the physical layout of the party, if it’s unfamiliar to you. Figure out where the bathroom is, where the food is, where the drinks are, as a way to get comfortable at the party.   Making your way around the party will also help you take stock of how many people are there, and what kind of party it is. There might be different activities going on in different parts of the space. If this is the case, you can start with the area in which you feel most at ease.  , Are people seated at tables in small groups? Or are there lots of people walking about? You can model your physical behavior on what others are doing. For example, if people are dancing, notice if they’re dancing alone or if they’re paired up. Try to position yourself in a part of the room where you’re likely to be most comfortable.  , If you focus on what you have in common, you’re likely to start to feel more confident. One of the reasons that strangers often talk about the weather is that it’s one thing we all have in common. This isn’t a bad place to start, but try to think of other options. For example, you might notice that someone’s wearing a tee-shirt of your favorite band, which makes for a good conversation starter.If you’re feeling self-conscious, finding similarities with others can help you calm down. Even in a new city or a country where you don’t speak the language, you’ll be able to find similarities if you’re focused on finding them.  , This can be a good way to get adjusted to the party, especially if you have a social connection to the host. Asking what you can do to help with the food or drinks is often appreciated, and gives you a good way to circulate through the party as well.Even if the host doesn’t need your help, she may pick up on your unspoken apprehension and provide something for you to do, or someone to introduce you to. If you’ve brought some food or a bottle of wine with you to the party, this provides an instant project for your arrival. Upon arrival, you can ask where would be the best place to put it, or where the host would like you to put it.  , Food makes a great topic of conversation between people who don’t know each other. Find someone who looks friendly at the buffet table, and make a pleasant remark about the food. For example, you might say something about how much you like one of the items or how glad you are to see that they’ve included vegetarian options.Asking a question about the food is another good conversation starter. You might say, “Everything looks so good. Which kind do you think you’re going to pick?” You can follow up by introducing yourself or making follow-up statements. If the other person doesn’t reciprocate, it’s quite easy to move along.  ",810,"['way', 'purpose', 'anxiety', 'buffet table', 'party', 'guests', 'host', 'party guests']"

If you want to mix the dough in a bread machine, put the ingredients into the machine's bucket. You'll need:3 cups (361 g) unbleached all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons (4.5 g) instant yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons (6 g) sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons (7 g) salt 1 large egg 2 tablespoons (28 g) unsalted butter, softened 3/4 cup (180 ml) lukewarm water; , If you want to mix the dough by hand, you can use your fingers or a firm, wooden spoon to combine the dough. Or beat the mixture with a stand mixer until you get a smooth dough. The kaiser roll dough should be elastic and soft.If you're using a bread machine, follow your machine's instructions for the dough cycle.  , Lightly grease a large bowl and scoop the dough into it. Cover the bowl with greased plastic wrap and put the bowl in a warm place to prove. Let the dough rest for about one hour, so the dough rises and looks puffy.If you're using a bread machine, you'll still need to transfer the dough to a greased bowl.  , Gently punch your fist down into the risen dough. Spread a little oil or cooking spray on a work surface and scoop the dough onto it. Use your fingers or a bench scraper to divide the dough into six pieces.Avoid using flour on the work surface. If the dough has too much flour, the rolls will be dense and tough.  , Take each piece of dough and roll them between your palms to make six round balls. Get out a baking sheet and lay a sheet of parchment paper on it or spray it with cooking spray. Set each ball on the baking sheet., Take a Kaiser roll stamp and place it directly over a ball of dough. Push down on the stamp, so you almost press down to the bottom. Do this for each ball of dough.Ensure that you cut deep enough or the segmented shape won't show up once the dough bakes. But, if you cut all the way to the bottom of the ball, the roll will split off into five separate pieces.  , Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Once you've shaped or stamped the rolls, put them cut-side down on the baking sheet and cover them with plastic wrap. Set them in a warm place to prove for 45 minutes to 1 hour.The rolls should almost double in size once they've finished proving.  , Take each piece of dough and roll them between your palms to make six round balls. Get out a baking sheet and lay a sheet of parchment paper on it or spray it with cooking spray. Set each ball on the baking sheet., Roll a ball of dough between your palms, so you get a long strip of dough (about 12 to 14-inches or 30 to 35-cm long). Repeat this for each of the balls of dough, so you have six strips of dough., Hold both ends of one strip of dough and loop the left end over the right end. You should now have a loose knot. Do this for each strip of dough.This knot is known as a granny knot. Remember to keep it loose, so you don't stretch the dough too much.  , Take one end of the strip and wrap the dough around the center loop twice. Do this for the other end of the strip and try to wrap the loops in the same direction.The roll should now look like a rosette or Kaiser roll.  , Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Once you've shaped or stamped the rolls, put them cut-side down on the baking sheet and cover them with plastic wrap. Set them in a warm place to prove for 45 minutes to 1 hour.The rolls should almost double in size once they've finished proving.  , During the last 30 minutes of proving, turn on the oven to 425 degrees F (220 C). It's important to preheat the oven while the rolls are still proving. If you wait until they've finished proving before you turn on the oven, the rolls might rise too much and deflate as they bake., Turn all the rolls over, so they're cut-side up (if you stamped them) or seam-side down (if you rolled them). If you want a decorative top, pour 1 tablespoon of milk in a bowl. Dip the top of each roll in the milk and sprinkle the tops with poppy or sesame seeds. Place them back on the baking sheet.For six kaiser rolls, you'll need about 2 tablespoons (18 g) of seeds.  , Put the rolls in the preheated oven and bake them for 15 to 17 minutes. The rolls should turn golden brown and feel soft once they've finished baking. Take them out of the oven to cool on a wire rack.To store leftover rolls, wrap them in plastic wrap and let them sit at room temperature. They'll keep for a few days.

Each state determines the structure and options that go along with its own plan. Some states offer matching grants and other benefits to in-state residents who buy into the state-sponsored 529 plan.Some of the benefits of investing in your own state’s sponsored 529 plan are:state tax deductions matching grants scholarship opportunities protection from creditors exemption from state financial aid calculations; , If you look at plans from states other than the one where you reside, you may find that another state offers a plan with strong benefits and does not have an in-state residence requirement. You might not benefit from all the options that are available to an in-state resident, but you may find that other benefits are still strong enough to make it a good choice.The College Savings Plans Network, CSPN.org, has a search feature that makes it easy to compare plans from multiple states.  , The Private College 529 Plan is a prepaid tuition plan that is owned and sponsored through a consortium of over 270 private colleges and universities around the country. A private plan will not provide the tax benefits that many state-sponsored plans provide. However, it is still an excellent way to save for college and secure your investment over time. By locking in the college credits now, you are guaranteed to have the payments for college in the future., A prepaid tuition plan allows you to lock in tuition rates at today’s prices, at eligible public and private universities. Most prepaid tuition plans are sponsored by the state government and have some residence requirements. These plans generally have a limited enrollment period. Your investment in a prepaid tuition plan is guaranteed by your state, in most cases. With a prepaid tuition plan, you generally purchase “credits” or “units” at today’s rates. When your child attends college, the plan will pay for the number of credits purchased, at the future tuition rate. So while your money does not exactly earn interest in the traditional sense, you can determine the growth by comparing tuition costs over time. Selecting a state-sponsored plan does not lock you in to a state college or university. With most plans, the money that you invest can be used for tuition and fees and any college or university, public or private.  , These fees will generally be enrollment fees and administrative management fees.The fees will vary from state to state, so ask before you invest.  , With a college savings plan, you invest in a choice of investment options, such as stock mutual funds, bond mutual funds and money market accounts. The money is invested and managed by a broker. Investments are more flexible than most prepaid tuition plans, but the money is not guaranteed by the state. Your investments are subject to fluctuations in the market and may even decrease in value., This type of plan is likely to have enrollment fees, annual maintenance fees, and, depending on the broker who is selling or investing the account, a range of additional broker’s fees. The fees will vary depending on the broker and the investments that you select. Ask questions about fees and get informed before you invest your money.You may be able to reduce your broker’s fees if you invest a large enough amount of money and maintain the stated minimum balance. Ask the broker about these “break-point discounts” if you are interested.  , In some states, you can buy directly into a college savings plan without paying some of the fees associated with other plans. If a plan is labeled as “Direct Sold,” then you are buying directly into the plan, without the use of an adviser or broker, and thus can avoid some fees.

They're typically orange and typically about 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm) in diameter. They're fired individually and simultaneously from two different points at each side of an arc of stations, where you'll rotate, firing between 2 and 4 shots at each target. A round of skeet involves 25 shots.; , Generally speaking, a skeet gun is an over-under double-barrel shotgun. Though any type of shotgun would be appropriate for the task of shooting skeet, this type of gun is often referred to as a ""skeet gun"" among experienced shooters for its accuracy and range.   Consider adding relatively open chokes to improve your accuracy and ensure that you'll hit the target regularly. This is a common addition among experienced skeet shooters.  , When shooting skeet, you'll move between 7 different stations in an arc (21 yards from the target launch) and one point from slightly closer up. You're essentially aiming in the same general direction each time (down range) but you'll change your angle on the targets when you move from point to point. There are two traps which release clay targets from either side of the range, one low target and one higher target, both of which will cross your field of vision and your firing line. The object is to hit both of the targets.  , The order of the targets being released changes from station to station. Generally, you'll only shoot one target from each trap, though this changes at different points along the way. Learning the pattern is part of the strategy of the event.At stations 1 and 2 a single target is released from the higher trap, then a single target is released from the lower trap (sometimes called ""high house"" and ""low house""). Then, there'll be another target released from the low trap, and then targets released simultaneously. On the simultaneous release, the object is to shoot the higher target first. A total of four shorts will be taken at each station.  At stations 3 through 5 a single target will be released from the higher target, then a single target released from the lower house, for a total of two shots at each station.  At stations 6 and 7 The pattern is exactly the same as stations one and two. A high target, a low target, and then simultaneous targets. The only difference is that the lower target should be shot first this time. There will be a total of four shots taken at each of these stations.  At station 8, the closer-up station, you'll shoot a high target and a low target. If you've not missed up until this point, there'll be a bonus shot on a target released from the lower house.  , If you've never shot clay before, stand inside any one of 7 stations positioned equidistantly around a half-circle on one side of the skeet field, between the high and low houses and take a few practice shots to get used to the flight pattern of the targets. Practice to get a sense of their timing and their basic trajectory.  , Facing the target, keep your back straight and spread your feet to a comfortable width. Bend your forward knee slightly and place your weight on your forward foot. Bring the gun to your shoulder and keep it tight in. Maintain good cheek weld on the stock and get a good sight picture with your gun.  , As you mount the gun, practice tracking your shots with the safety on and the rifle unloaded a few times to get a sense of the motion. The targets move pretty fast so it's no wonder that experienced shooters have to develop a fair amount of muscle memory to shoot well. It's got less to do with perfect ""aim"" and more to do with these mechanics. Once you've gotten your swing loose, it's time to shoot a few targets.  , Getting a sense of the trajectory and the lead you need to give each target will take some time, but once you've got it dialed in, you'll be winging 'em out of the sky. Adjust your lead time if you are missing the targets too often and move from one target to the next. Use your natural swing as much as possible to quickly track each target and squeeze the trigger., Just as in golf and basketball, accurate target shooting like this involves a certain amount of follow through. Imagine that your swing is like an arc that you push a button on to start and pull the trigger to activation at some point along the way. The arc doesn't stop after you fire. Keep moving the gun through your swing after you pull the trigger, but remove your finger from the trigger when you're finished.  , To get regular access to the club’s facilities, join a skeet club. There, you can meet other shooters, learn tips, and even start competing. Some clubs have skeet leagues you can join.  , As an NSSA member, you’ll be able to shoot in registered tournaments, improving your accuracy and your scores, and even acquiring a ranking.   The levels are generally classed at different skill levels, so you can compete against shooters with a similar handicap when you're first getting started. Don't worry about being the best yet. Focus on the mechanics and keep shooting and you'll eventually climb up., An experienced shooter can offer you helpful advice, critiques, and pointers to straighten that learning curve. As you improve, a coach can continue helping as you compete, kind of like a caddy does a golfer. Certified skeet-shooting instructors are an invaluable help when you're first learning.  , Reading about it won't help you get any more accurate. Get out there. Shooting regularly will help build in the necessary muscle memory and get you shooting accurately. After a while, it'll be raining clay.

"[""understand what they're going through"", 'watch for the symptoms', 'if this is the first time the individual has experienced this', 'seek emergency medical attention', 'find out the cause of the attack']",How to Help Someone Having a Panic Attack1," People with panic disorder have sudden and repeated attacks of fear that last for several minutes, up to an hour, but rarely over that because the body simply does not physically have enough energy to panic for that long. Panic attacks are characterized by a fear of disaster or of losing control even when there is no real danger.A panic attack can occur without warning and for no obvious reason. In extreme cases, the symptoms may be accompanied by an acute fear of dying. Although they are quite distressing and can last from 5 minutes to somewhere over an hour, panic attacks are not life-threatening on their own.   Panic attacks arouse the body to a peak level of excitement which makes the individual feel not in control of him or herself. The mind is preparing for a false fight or flight mode, forcing the body to take over to help the victim face or run from the perceived danger, real or not. The hormones cortisol and adrenaline are released from the adrenal glands into the blood stream and the process begins -- this forms the heart of a panic attack. The mind cannot distinguish the difference between a real danger from the one that is in the mind. If you believe it, then it is real as far as your mind is concerned. They may act as if their life is in danger, and they feel like it is. Try to put it in perspective; if someone was holding a knife to your throat and saying ""I'm going to slit your throat. But I'm going to wait and keep you guessing when I'll decide to do it. It could be any time now."" There has never been a recorded instance of a person dying of a panic attack.They can only be fatal if accompanied by pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma, or if extreme behaviors subsequently result (like jumping out of a window).; , If the person has never experienced a panic attack before, they'll be panicking on two different levels -- the second for not knowing what's going on. If you can pinpoint that they're going through a panic attack, this alleviates half the problem. Symptoms include:Palpitations or chest pain Speeding up of the heart rate (rapid heartbeat) Hyperventilation (over-breathing) Trembling Dizziness/lightheadedness/feeling faint (this is usually from hyperventilating) Tingling/numbness in fingers or toes Ringing in the ears or temporary loss or hearing Sweating Nausea Abdominal cramping Hot flashes or chills Dry mouth Difficulty swallowing Depersonalization (disconnected feeling) Headache  , When in doubt, it is always best to seek immediate medical attention. This is doubly important if the individual has diabetes, asthma or other medical problems. It is important to note that the signs and symptoms of a panic attack can be similar to those of a heart attack. Do keep this in mind when assessing the situation.  , Talk to the individual and determine if he or she is having a panic attack and not another kind of medical emergency (such as a heart or asthma attack) which would require immediate medical attention. If they've experienced it before, they may be able to clue you in to what's going on.   Many panic attacks don't have a cause or, at the very least, the person panicking isn't consciously aware of what the cause is. Because of this, determining the cause may not be doable. If the person doesn't know why, take their word for it and stop asking. Not everything is for a good reason.

Leave the clock border in tact--this is where you will place the LEGO figures. If you have to take the clock entirely apart, leave the clock border/frame on the sidelines, as you will be painting the clock face anyway. No point getting paint on the border.       Clean area around the clock face and prepare it for painting. Make sure you remove any debris or dust using a damp paper towel. Be sure if you wipe dust off the face you allow it to dry before painting.      ; , Depending on the look you are going for, cover the clock face with the paint color of your choice. don't forget to remove the clock's arms.   Use a stencil to create a Star Wars motif on the clock face. The Internet is filled with sites that provide you with a variety of shapes that can be transferred to the clock surface.       Consider using either (or both) spray paint and/or regular acrylic paint. If you are painting a large surface, spray paint may work wonders and get the job done quicker.       Return the clock arms to its original position after the paint has dried and after applying the background.       Wait up to 10 hours or overnight before putting the clock back together to ensure the paint has fully dried.        , You will be adding figures and possibly LEGO bricks around the perimeter of the clock. Make sure you have enough room so the hands don’t get stuck on a Lego block or person.   Trim the hands if necessary. Most likely the pieces should fit nicely along the edges and trimming the hands should not be necessary. However, make sure either you place the LEGO pieces strategically around the outermost edges or you use sharp scissors to trim down the hands.        , Use your imagination and a lot of glue to affix colorful Lego bricks and the characters around the perimeter of the clock border.  Use liquid nails or super glue to place LEGO bricks around the clock frame. Skip the areas that point toward numbers--this is where your Lego characters will be placed.       Return the clock glass to its original place.       Cut small strips of self-adhesive Velcro tape and place tape on the perimeter of the clock, in line with each number. The pieces of tape will be placed in line with each clock number so make sure you cut a piece that will be long enough to hold the Star Wars character but not too long that it blends into the next number. As an alternative you can use a lego block or piece.       Cut small strips of self-adhesive Velcro tape to be placed on the back of each LEGO Star Wars character. Make sure they are tapped firmly on the backs of each character.       Attach characters to the pieces of Velcro tape on the clock.

Or, it might be your mind if it's full of racing, uncontrollable, negative or unhappy thoughts. Or perhaps it's your skin, your knees, your lymphatic system, your broken heart – just pick whichever part of your body is hurting most or causing you the most discomfort in your opinion.; , What do you notice when you do this? For most people, you'll find that your body as a whole, including the painful area, tenses up. Be aware that this is a common strategy that we use to try to deal with pain – yet you've just learned that it doesn't work so well!  , This time, pretend that the pain is no longer present. Ignore the pain and tell yourself that you're not hurting. This strategy is like playing peekaboo – first you see it but then when you no longer pay attention to it, you expect it to go away even though it's still very much there. Consider how this makes you feel – does the pain go away? No? You've just discovered another common strategy for dealing with pain that doesn't work!  , Now say the following phrase to yourself, either in your head or out loud: ""I am resting for now."" Then just pause. Think about what you notice now. For many people, focusing on resting works far better than working at trying to fix something relentlessly or to try to hide from it. Indeed, Dan Howard says that the more you work at trying to stop the pain, the less successful you will be. Instead, intentional resting requires that you notice what is going on in your body and then choose to rest what hurts.   This exercise can be done anywhere – you don't have to stop what you're doing but can incorporate this desire to rest the hurting part of your body into whatever it is you're doing. It can be done when walking, exercising, sitting, lying down, or being around other people.  , This isn't by any means an exact science and it'll require some trial and error on your own behalf to find what works for you. For example, Dan Howard has found that some parts of his body respond better to saying ""I'm resting into my "" than saying ""I'm resting for "". The aim is to find a settling feeling, a feeling that you've landed into deep restfulness for that pained part of yourself and you're releasing yourself from unease, anxiety and discomfort. It's a healing process and a restorative process.   It may be as simple as saying to the hurting part of your body: ""Rest"". Give it the permission to rest.  , It may take a number of attempts before the pieces fall into place and you discover how intentional rest soothes you and allows you to truly rest to the point of restoring your energy and reducing any pain.  , Rest does matter and yet it is tied up in so many negative connotations such as being lazy, selfish or unaware that many of us are too guilt-ridden to treat rest as the restorative we deserve. Martha Beck points out that we need to watch animals to be reminded what real rest is like. She relates an incident where she was watching a pride of lions resting after an unsuccessful hunt. Instead of sitting around down and low about it (and analyzing what went wrong if they could do such a thing), they sat, purred and rested for hours, surrendering to the need to regain strength rather than wallow in defeat.Yes, life can be hard and sometimes life stacks up all the odds against us and causes us to feel that we never get a break. However, by choosing to rest intentionally, you can heal the scars and restore your energy to face the challenges with greater strength and sense of purpose.

You are the stranger trying to buy them and take them away from the absent parent.; , You can have your opinion, but don't judge and don't criticize. Note mentally your thoughts, but keep them locked.  , The stepparent chose you, but the kids will always come first. Be understanding. No one ever told you it would be easy. If you live together, be prepared to do things by yourself pretty often. The habits will change and include you, but it could take time.  , If the kids come to you and ask embarrassing questions, be prepared to never say a bad word about the absent parent. Even if daddy is a real jerk who left wife and kids for a young and big-breasted woman, you are not allowed to criticize. Not yet.

Good points for you!  , ""Can I ask your son to help clear the table ?"" or ""May I take the kids out for an ice cream?"".

This one is pretty hard, but please try never to criticize the way your companion parents. At this point in your relationship, you have probably seen things you don't approve. But a conflict is not the perfect timing for that. If you disapprove something about the kids' education, try to speak quietly with your partner.

Make sure you include your partner's children in any family planning you do - sure, they can't be the ones to decide whether you have more children or not, but they can be involved. Giving them some insight and input into the decision will help them feel more like part of the family, and will ease any concerns that you're ""replacing"" them with a new child.

Grocery stores, museums, coffee shops and dog parks are great places to meet women who are enjoying themselves and usually feeling relaxed.When a woman is at a bar or club, she is already on her guard. She may not be looking for a long-term relationship, or she might be out with the girls for the night. The place is not ideal for connecting with someone more than casually.  , People generally appreciate a good sense of humor. Be friendly and make light-hearted jokes to make the girl laugh.There are a lot of different situations that lend themselves to demonstrating your sense of humor. Try making jokes at the following things:The circumstance around you. If you’re at a park or walking down the street and you notice something funny, say something about it. Make a joke about yourself. If you’re really tall, talk about how you can see the next city from your viewpoint. Tell a funny story about yourself. Did you get into a silly fight in middle school? Tell her about it, and be sure to include the details about the ridiculous clothes you wore at the time or what song you rocked out to right before you got into the fight. Talk about current events. Some things that happen in the news or with celebrities can be good material for making jokes. These jokes might work well as your personal inside jokes later on. Careful not to use crude or offensive humor. Until you know someone very well, this type of humor should be avoided at all costs.  , Show her that you’ve noticed something about her by complimenting her on it. For example, you might tell her:   ”I really like your hair long like that.” “You made some really smart points in the class debate today.””You’re really easy to talk to.”  , Once you find out the girl’s name, be sure to use it several times in the conversation. You might want to write it down later to help you remember it.  , You might be nervous about talking with a girl because she might reject you. Don’t let fears of rejection prevent you from striking up a conversation. At the very worst, she will ignore you or tell you to go away. But at best, she will return the conversation.This also helps demonstrate your confidence. View this as an opportunity for acceptance.  , When you meet someone new, give her a chance even if she doesn’t immediately fulfill your ideal of the perfect girlfriend. Don’t eliminate someone for silly or superficial reasons.   Make sure you don’t only compliment this person on her physical appearance. You can tell her that she looks pretty, but make sure you also compliment her on her artistic sense or her ability to weave through rush-hour traffic.  , If you like someone but your first conversation didn’t go well, definitely talk with her again. It may be that she was distracted or under a lot of stress when you first met.   You might need to arrange “accidentally” bumping into her. For example, if you initially met her at the dog park, keep taking your dog there regularly until you see her again.  , Don’t make a girl feel uncomfortable by acting possessive, following her around, or trying to talk to her about inappropriate things.

Don't try to be quick witted if you simply aren't wired that way; you risk looking foolish and being so frustrated with yourself that the attempt isn't worth it.   Memorization and practice can help you get the most out of the abilities you have, and may get you through some good verbal exchanges here and there. Like artists in other fields, though, the masters of witty comebacks seem to have an innate gift to pair with their demeanor and preparation.; , There is no magic formula for developing a quicker wit, but improving your listening skills can help immensely. Look at the other person, and focus on their words and what they mean by them. The wittiest comebacks are created in direct response to what has been said, not pulled out of a stockpile of witticisms that sort of fit the situation.Practice focusing on what is being said instead of letting your mind wander off trying to formulate comebacks. Try practice activities like ""verbal volleyball,"" in which you and a partner take turns inventing a story one word at a time -- they say a word, you listen closely and come up with the next word as quickly as you can, and so on., Try writing your own version of a conversation that you wished you'd been witty in. Replace that past attempt with a better script and work from this point to guide your future wittiness.However, remember that the best comebacks are created in the moment, not rehashed from similar circumstances in the past. Use this exercise for inspiration and practice, not as a source for specific comebacks.  , If you think about the insult, you'll dwell on it, letting it get to you personally. Instead, don't focus on the insult but on responding quickly.The trick behind witty comebacks is speed. Don't analyze the ramifications of what has just been said; instead treat it like the game it is and the insult merely becomes a shuttle to be hit back. For instance, if someone ends an insult with “and you smell, too,"" don’t mull over your hygiene routine while formulating a response. Focus strictly on the words and come back with something like “Yes, but at least my stink will shower off, unlike your rancid personality.""  , Enter the fray and enjoy the spirit of the confrontation instead of fearing it or downplaying it. See confrontation as an invitation to play rather than a reason to feel insulted. If you simply can’t make yourself see things this way, you may be better off avoiding witty comeback attempts in favor of another approach.Seize the opportunity to point out any contradictions the other person makes while trying to show off their wit. Doing so usually devalues an insult in the eyes of the insulter. However, don't pick something apart for longer than you need to. If you get into a long-winded reply, they might interrupt you with another comeback, thereby making what you were saying irrelevant. For example, if they say you're not worth their time to insult, reply ""Well, I'm glad to hear you weren't actually trying to insult me the past five minutes.""  , Sarcasm has its place if it’s treated with cleverness and is not overdone. If someone tries to insult you with a nonsensical comment, feel free to drawl sarcastically, ""Well, there's an intelligent answer."" Brevity is helpful here as well; a sarcastic but rambling monologue will not have the same impact.   Remember that sarcasm also involves good timing and proper tone of voice. Think of Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series or Oscar Wilde, both good practitioners of sarcasm that is pulled off succinctly and effectively. Use sarcasm playfully, not to cut someone to the core. Consider your opponent and whether they’re equipped to see sarcasm for what it is and not take it too personally.For instance: ""Oh, that last insult was so close to making sense. Please keep trying.""  , The most famous examples of witty retorts are invariably short and sweet, finishing the job all at once.In most cases, your witty comeback should be sufficient to end the matter there and then. Continuing to discuss, argue, or toss points around will likely weaken the impact of what you've said.   It's up to you whether you change the topic, walk away to resume conversing with this person another time, or pretend they're not even there anymore. The key thing is to have the upper hand before you move on. Don't just walk away in the middle of being insulted, because it suggests you can't take it. However, you can stand up for yourself if necessary by saying: ""I'll come back when your tantrum is over so we can get back to trading insults."" That puts the onus on your opponent to behave more appropriately and gives you a dignified exit.  , Don't get angry, or even a little annoyed. Bear in mind that your opponent's insults are not worth your time or anger. Detach yourself from personal dislike of a person and focus on what's been said in a calm, objective manner instead. Focus on being witty and stick with your resolve to stay calm.Think of it like stepping to the plate against the other team’s ace pitcher. Don’t focus on whether or not he’s a jerk; calmly focus on the ball and driving it into the gap for the game-winning hit. Practice looking perfectly calm, even amused or bemused, in front of a mirror. Even if you're extremely angry on the inside, on the outside, you are calm – tell yourself this and your thoughts will respond in kind.  , While you're learning to be witty, be tactful and diplomatic in the meantime. If wittiness never comes to you, at least people will be unaware of all your striving to be witty and will just presume you're polite!

If you ask for their advice or involvement in the process, they may be more willing to take your side.Ask them to help you do more research on the topic. Say something like, “I would like to drive with my friend to visit her sister at college. Can you help us figure out how long that would take and what the best route would be?” You could also say something such as, “I really think I want to pursue a Ph.D. in art history. Can you help me figure out which study abroad program would be most beneficial for helping me reach this goal?”  , It’s not a good idea to ask your parents for new privileges as you’re all trying to get to school or work on time. By having a calm discussion with them, you’re more likely to convince them to see your side.   Figure out a time to talk with them when you will not be rushed. If you have younger siblings, try to talk when they are not home. That way, you won’t be distracted or interrupted.  , By getting right to the point, you can more quickly start to explain to your parents what you want and why you think you deserve that new privilege. Stay calm and be respectful during your conversation.   Say something like, “Mom and dad, I’m getting older, and I think I’ve shown I’m responsible enough to have my curfew extended.” Another approach could be, “I’ve really gotten interested in French history and culture through my French classes at school, I would like to study in Paris next year to really immerse myself in the culture.” You could also remind them of how they could help themselves by granting you new freedoms: “I think you would have a better time at your cousin’s wedding if you made it a romantic weekend. I am happy to stay home by myself for a few days while you get away and relax.”  , Take time during the discussion to show your parents how much you have matured recently, whether through improving your grades or volunteering at an animal hospital. In the hustle and bustle of daily life, sometimes everyone forgets to notice the changes going on around them.   You could show them how much your bank account has grown recently through your dedication to saving and/or your part-time job. Be sure to remind them of all you have done recently around the house to make your home a better place. If you’ve recently improved your math grade, make it a point to tell your parents during this discussion. Anything you can add about your added maturity and sense of responsibility will help you.  , If you let them know that you’ve taken the time to research and think about what you’re asking for, they will be more likely to take your request seriously.   Use your research to say something like, “I know it will be expensive for me to study in Paris next year, but here’s how I plan to pay for most of it.” Or, you could take another approach, “Studies show that those who study abroad have an increased chance of attending graduate school.” If your request involves extending your curfew, say something like, “Mom and dad, the concert I want to attend ends later than my curfew. The concert venue is in a safe location, and I will be with several friends. I think that I deserve an extended curfew because I know how to be safe and I will be responsible.”  , Despite all of your planning and persuasive efforts, your parents may not agree to additional freedoms or privileges for you just yet.   Calmly ask about their objections. You could say, “I’m really disappointed that you feel this way. Why do you think this is a bad idea?” Don’t yell or cry; that response will further convince them you are not mature enough for extended privileges. Ask what you can do to prove to them you are ready for this step. You could say something such as, “I understand you think I’m not ready to travel alone yet, but can we talk about this in a month or two? I think I’ll be able to show you that I’m responsible and ready for this privilege before we discuss this again.”  ",734,"['time', 'privilege', 'decision', 'parents', 'request', 'discussion']"

If this pressure is applied wrong, the result might be wearing away the enamel of the tooth's surface — and this is the least of the problems. If the pressure forces your tooth too much in one direction, bone resorption can occur and cause the tooth (or teeth) to become loose. You can also impact the blood flow to the tooth, which causes the tooth to die. If your tooth dies, it will eventually have to be removed.   If your teeth teeth become loose, it will be harder to chew food, and your tooth might eventually fall out. Your tooth can become discolored. Its naturally ivory/white color will turn to dull gray or black. This is s sign that the pulp containing the nerve and blood vessels has died, leaving internal stains.; , An improperly fitting retainer will irritate your gums. It may cause bleeding, infection, and inflammation. Because your gums are essential to maintaining your teeth's health, damage to your gums results in damage to the bone support and ligaments that hold your tooth in place.   If you notice any irritation to your gums, remove your retainer immediately. Your gums can recede or pull away from your tooth. This exposes more of the tooth's surface to bacteria, and weakens the overall strength of the tooth. This can cause sensitivity and affect the look of your smile.  , If you purchase your retainers from an orthodontist, it will be made of substance approved by the FDA for safe oral use; however, making your own retainer may mean you use plastics contaminated by BPA, a common material in many commercial products that may cause serious health problems.Even low doses of BPA ingested over time may result in chronic health issues. Making a retainer out of wax means that you are likely to be wearing BPA-rich material in your mouth.  , An orthodontist is a dental specialist. They must attend four to eight years of post-undergraduate education in order to practice. There are only 63 programs in orthodontics in the United States, and they are quite competitive to attend.If orthodontics weren't a challenging field, it wouldn't require so much education. You need to know physics, geometry and have a good spatial vision so you can predict the final result. The practice of orthodontics and dentistry is a medical practice, affecting not only the mouth but the overall body health. An infection caused by improper use of retainer can result in infection carried to the bloodstream.  , You can use the red wax wrapping from popular cheese products, such as Babybel cheese, or you can use the clear wax wrapping of certain candies. For example, some stores sell miniature soda bottles made of wax. Consider, too, using orthodontic wax, which you may be able to find at the drugstore.   Your choice can be based on the color of wax, or on the most available product. Dispose of the cheese or soda in whatever way you want to. All you really need is the waxy coating.  , If you don't have access to boiling water, very hot tap water will also work. Put the wax into the water and let it soak for short time. Being immersed in hot water will soften the wax.   You'll want to take the wax out while the water is still hot. Putting wax into the microwave to heat it isn't recommended.  , Holding the waxy product between your thumbs and fingers, press repeatedly until the wax shapes itself into a flattish oval shape. You want the shape to eventually fit over your teeth.   Don't let the wax get larger than your mouth. If the wax is too small, it won't fit over the width of your mouth.  , With your thumb and your first finger, press the wax between your upper lip and your upper teeth. Hold the wax gently against your teeth and gums as you spread it, until it cools down and gets harder.   Don't scrape your gums. You'll have to be gentle as you work. It helps to use a mirror while you spread the wax.  , Working from left to right, pinch the wax with your thumb and index finger against your teeth until it's smooth and flat. Make sure that the wax doesn't rub against or dig into your upper gum.   Gently press the wax against the roof of your mouth with your thumb until it cools down and gets harder. Your fake retainer can be as wide as you want it to be. Usually, it will cover all of your front upper teeth. The retainer will harden as it cools.

A good protectant spray will let leather or canvas breathe, while also preventing stains and water from absorbing. It will also help wipe off mud, grass or grime on all kinds of shoe materials. Liberally repeat application every few weeks. It will not discolor your white shoes. ; , The longer you let stains set in, the harder they will be to remove. Prevent this problem by wiping off things, like mud or wet sand, as soon as you can. Use a damp cloth or sponge with a drop of dish soap, or use pre-moistened sneaker wipes. Throw some sneaker wipes in your gym bag, or keep them for on the go activities.  , Yes, the same cleaner you use to wipe down your countertops will keep your white sneakers looking brand spanking new. Every time you come home from wearing your shoes, spray a little Fantastik, 409, or whatever your poison may be and wipe it off with a paper towel or dishcloth.   Do not use a cleaner with bleach, because it can discolor shoes. Spray just enough to clean dirt and scuffs. You don't need to drench them.  , The same stain remover pen that spot-cleans your clothes works great on your white canvas sneakers too. Whenever you get a grass stain or mud splatter on your shoes, treat it with a stain remover pen ASAP to keep them clean. Work the pen over stitching to keep it as bright as the rest of the shoe too.   Remember this is a spot treatment. There's no need to completely cover your shoes in stain remover.  , Sometimes all the prevention possible will not keep your white sneakers always looking clean. Before you do a thorough cleaning with a damp sponge, brush or wipe off any dirt, mud, grass clippings or sand. It’s important to get rid of excess debris, while your shoes are dry, so you don’t set stains in more.  , Remove your laces to get them, and your shoes, looking as clean as possible. If you attempt to wash your shoes with the laces still in them, grime will accumulate around the openings. Place laces in a small mesh laundry bag to keep them from wrapping around other laundry. Set them out to dry and do not place them in the dryer to avoid shrinkage., Drop one to two drops of dish soap on a damp sponge or dish rag. Place your sponge in a bowl of water or rinse it in the sink to dilute. Don’t use too much soap on your nice, white sneakers! Wring your sponge or rag out to remove excess water, and gently wipe your shoes down from tongue to sole. Do not scrub leather. Carefully rub dirt and repeat if necessary.  , Take a wet dish rag with a dime-sized amount of laundry soap to clean canvas. Wring the dish rag out and wipe down your shoes thoroughly. Wet the rag again to remove all accumulated dirt and soap. Wipe down your shoes a second time. Repeat if necessary, and let them dry by a fan or in the open air for a few hours.   Do not place canvas in the washing machine. It can tear them and yellow your soles.  , Even after you have thoroughly brushed and cleaned your white sneakers, you may be left with discolored areas. Leather shoe polish can take care of this. Wipe polish on with a soft cloth, like an old t-shirt, and let it dry for a few minutes. Take a clean side of your old t-shirt to lightly buff out any scuff marks.   White leather shoe polish is good for solid white shoes. Use a neutral shoe polish on white shoes that have accent colors. A neutral polish goes on clear and can be used on other leather shoes or bags., A magic eraser works wonders on smooth rubber soles, and leather for that matter. Dip your magic eraser in water and squeeze out the excess. Gently scrub your soles and wipe water off with a paper towel. Repeat this process until you remove as many scuff marks and stains as you can.   This works best on smooth soles. A magic eraser will not get into textured areas as easily.  , Rubber soles can be a tricky area to keep clean on white sneakers, especially if the soles are textured. Spot clean scuffs or grass stains and get into crevices with a toothbrush. Spray an all-purpose cleaner on your toothbrush or use soap and water, and scrub away.  , The sun can yellow-white rubber soles. Keep your shoes in a closet or under a bed. Make sure they're stored away from large, open windows and never keep your shoes outside.

"['pick out a bar of soap to use', 'grate the soap into a bowl', 'blend the soap with boiled water', 'add glycerin to the mixture', 'customize it with extra ingredients', 'create the right consistency', 'pour the soap into containers']",How to Make Liquid Soap1," You can make liquid soap from any bar of soap you have around the house. Use whatever leftover or half-used bars you have, or put some extra thought into your choice to create a liquid soap you can use for a specific purpose.For example:   Use a bar of facial soap to make a liquid soap you can use on your face. Use a bar of antibacterial soap to make a good cleansing hand soap to use in your kitchen or bathroom. Use a bar of moisturizing soap to make a liquid soap you can use as body wash. Use unscented soap if you want to add your own scent to create customized liquid soap.; , Use a fine cheese grater to grate the entire bar of soap into a bowl. Use the finest grater you have so that when it's time for the soap to melt, the process goes more quickly. You can cut the soap into chunks if that helps you grate it more easily.   You should end up with about 1 cup (229 g) of soap flakes. If you have less, grate a second bar of soap. This recipe can easily be doubled or tripled if you want to make a lot of liquid soap. It makes a great gift, especially when it's stored in pretty jars.  , Boil 1 cup (235 ml) of water, then pour into a blender along with the grated soap. Whip the water and soap until it takes on the consistency of paste.   Making soap in your blender may leave a residue that's hard to clean out, so if you'd prefer not to use it, you can make your soap on the stove instead. Simply add the soap flakes to the water once it has started to boil on your stove. Try making soap in the microwave as another alternative. Place a cup of water in a microwave safe dish, bring it to a boil in the microwave, add the flakes, and let them sit for a few minutes to melt. Place the dish back in the microwave and heat it up in 30-second increments if it needs more heat.  , Glycerin acts as a moisturizer for the skin, making liquid soap a little gentler on your body than regular bar soap. Mix in 1 tsp. (5 g) glycerin, stirring until it is thoroughly combined.  , Here's where you can get creative with your liquid soap, especially if you started with an unscented bar. Consider adding the following ingredients if you want to make your liquid soap special:   Mix in honey or lotion to add moisture. Stir in a few drops of essential oil to scent the soap. Add 10 to 20 drops each of tea tree and lavender essential oils to make your soap naturally antibacterial. Use some natural food coloring to change the color. Avoid using standard chemical-based coloring, since it's not good for your skin to absorb.  , Continue to whip the mixture in the blender once it has thoroughly cooled. Gradually pour water into the mixture as it whips until your soap is an ideal consistency. If you're not using a blender, just stir in the water and whisk it vigorously., Once it has completely cooled, you can pour it into jars or pump containers using a funnel. If you have a large amount of soap, put whatever doesn't fit in your containers into a large bottle or jug. Keep the remaining soap on hand to use when refilling your smaller bottles.

"['consider making an inter band contract or ""band agreement.""', 'find a practice space', 'practice!', 'begin writing songs', 'come up with a name', 'record a demo or record']",How to Form a Band2," It is hard to get four or five musicians with individual lives to commit to each other and the musical project. One band member who is never available to rehearse or do shows can kill a band. This ""contract"" will offer some protection for what a member can do with the name, payment, ownership of songs, equipment, etc., if/when he/she leaves the band.   Solving this now will help to avoid disputes in the future. Keep in mind though, it's common that these kinds of issues will turn off potential band mates. So, make sure they are in agreement and vested before forcing a contract on them. Have it drafted by an unbiased third party (or take templates off the Internet). If one person writes it, it may seem like a power trip. If the members agree, you may choose a single person to write the contract, but have all members agree on the rules of the contract, and be in unanimous agreement before signing.  , Will it be in someone's basement? Garage? Will you keep all of your equipment there? Get permission from whoever owns the property you and your band choose for your practice space.  , Becoming a good band takes time and effort. Practice will also ensure that you and your band-mates develop a rapport. In addition, recording time is expensive. The better practiced you are the quicker you can get in the studio and out the door. As an artist, you're probably not made of money.   A good work ethic is important to success. If someone is unwilling to practice, they may be dead weight that needs to be removed. Make practicing a routinely thing -- the band needs to be a priority if taken seriously.  , Write as many as you can, without sacrificing quality for quantity. However, know that to have a headline at a show you'll need to have a repertoire of at least 11 or 12 songs to get through your time slot.   An opening band can have as few as 4-5 songs, so try to get your very best 5 songs together and open for more known bands at first to ease into the scene. You also may want to copyright your work. You can copyright them at copyright.gov. It is a fairly simple process. All you need to do is fill out a PA (performing rights) form (not an RA (sound recording) form; that will come later, when you sign a record deal).  , You could pick something meaningful...or just one that sounds cool. Typically the entire band will decide on the name. The best names are usually short and easy to read and spell; that way it's easy to remember. It's called branding! On another note, do NOT use a name that is already trademarked, unless you plan on being a tribute band.   Do research on other bands. If you're a band based out of Seattle by the name of ""Hockey Scientists"" and there's a band in Portland called ""Golf Doctors,"" you may want to go another direction. If you really get stuck on a name, have everyone come up with 5 adjectives and 5 nouns, then try to agree on a band name using one of each.  , This will be your best piece of promotional material. It can be sold at shows, used to get record deals, agents, managers, etc., and used to promote to fans online.   As always, utilize Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites, too. Consider recording a small snippet of a few songs to send to bar managers and the like. You'll be able to shoot them a short email telling them you'd love to play at their venue -- and for thirty seconds of their time and the click of a button, they can hear your sound.

"['tailor your message', 'prepare the required components', 'polish your presentation', 'follow the guidelines precisely', 'continue to build your business']",How to Apply for an Entrepreneurial Grant3," If you are applying for multiple grants, it is okay to have a general business plan that you will submit to each funding organization. However, before you submit each application, you want to make sure to include some information that is specific to that grant. For example, you can mention the goals of the funding organization.In your executive summary, you can discuss some specific ways that your business can help the funding organization meet its goals. Add a few different sentences about this for each application you submit. For example, you could say, ""Our company, ABC Communications, will work towards meeting some of the same goals as XYZ Grant Funding. For instance, both organizations value adding jobs to the community."" You could also write something such as, ""XYZ Grant Funding has a long history of helping organizations succeed in making agricultural innovations. At ABC Farms, we will continue to seek innovations in that field."" You can also adjust the other components of your application to fit the criteria for each grant. Try to avoid phrases such as ""To whom it may concern"". Instead, do some research and find out the name of the person who will likely be reading your grant and address it to her.  , Each grant that you apply for will have its own specific list of requirements. However, there are several documents that you will need to include in most grant applications. It is a good idea to keep several copies of these handy, as well as easily accessible electronic versions.Most grants will require you to submit financial information. This could include proof of income, past tax returns, and other financial documents, such as bank statements. If your business is already functioning, you may need to submit a business credit report. This is similar to a personal credit report, and will help demonstrate the credit of your business. You may also need to submit legal documents. Be prepared to send copies of any commercial leases or any necessary business permits.  , Before you submit your application, it is important to make sure that your materials all look professional. Spend some time working on the layout of your business plan. Ensure that every component is clearly labeled and attractively presented.Use titles and subtitles to make sure that the reader can easily find all of the information included in your application. Choose a font that is easy to read. Look over your graphs and tables. Make sure that they are easy to read and clearly convey the information that you are presenting.  , Before you submit your application, review the guidelines again. If you do not submit your application properly, it could be disqualified. Make a checklist of all requirements and ensure that you have met them.Adhere to delivery guidelines. Many grants today require electronic submission, so make sure that you send the materials as requested. If you have questions about the guidelines, make sure to ask. It is better to clarify than to submit something incorrectly.  , Remember that most grants require an extensive application process. While you are completing your application, keep working on other aspects of your business. Even if you are successful at securing the grant, it might take a while for the funds to be delivered.Grants are not guaranteed, so continue to search for alternative revenue sources while you are working on applications.

Also, avoid checking the box during wet and/or cold weather, especially if it is less than 50 °F (10 °C) outside. Instead, check the box during calm, dry weather conditions. Remember that you only need to monitor the box during nesting season, i.e., late March through August.Avoid checking the box 12 to 14 days after the bird's eggs have hatched. Checking the box during this time can cause premature fledging. Do not check the box too frequently, i.e., every day. Instead, check the box only once or twice a week, or every seven to 10 days. How frequently you check the box depends on how serious predator problems are, how much data you want to collect, and how much time you have.  , Before opening the box, make your presence known. If you do not, you might startle the female, and a startled female could damage the eggs.Make your presence known by whistling, calling out, and/or lightly tapping on the side of the box.  , Once you have made your presence known, slowly open the box. Do not yank it open. Spend less than a minute when checking the box to avoid stressing the birds, or chilling the eggs or nestlings.Once you are finished checking, slowly close the box, as well. You want to close it slowly because a sitting female or one of the nestlings might decide to fly out. If they do, you do not want to inadvertently hurt the birds by closing the door too quickly.  , Every time you check the box, record what you see. This way, you can avoid checking the box during the critical period when disturbing the box could cause premature fledging. This critical period is 12 to 14 days after the nestlings have hatched. You will also be able to determine when fledging may occur, i.e., 17 to 18 days after hatching. It is ok to check the box during the official fledging period.Record the day egg hatching begins and when the last egg is laid. This will help you calculate when the critical period will take place. Remember, do not check the box during the critical period in order to avoid premature fledging. Also record what kind of nest you see, how many eggs and nestlings there are, and any evidence of problems.  , There are a variety of pests that can make a home out of your nesting box. These pests include House Sparrows, paper wasps, fire ants, bumblebees and honeybees, blowfly larvae, mice, and snakes. When monitoring the box for these pests, always use caution and never reach in with your hands.House Sparrows are non-native birds that may attack and destroy eggs, nestlings, and incubating adults of native bird species. By identifying a House Sparrow's eggs, you can remove their nests from your box. Because these birds are non-native species, you may legally remove their nests, eggs, and young. A House Sparrow's eggs may be cream, white, grey, or green in color. All of the eggs are speckled with irregular fine, brown speckles. The shell is also smooth with a slight gloss.",523,"['good records', 'pests', 'afternoon', 'minute', 'box', 'noise']"

The type of RAM is DDR3 SDRAM and the speed is 1333 MHz. This laptop has two RAM slots so take advantage of this and consider buying two sticks of 4GB RAM for optimal performance. When you go to the store make sure the RAM meets all of these specifications. If you are not sure if it is the correct type of RAM, ask a customer service representative to confirm it. If you are buying two sticks of 4GB then it should cost approximately 20-25 dollars. You could also buy it online if you prefer.; ,   Establish a safe and comfortable area to perform your RAM upgrade such as a clear table. You will need your laptop, a Philips screwdriver, and your new RAM  ,   Make sure your laptop is shut down and that the battery is removed. You are going to be dealing with fragile computer components that can be damaged by static charges. Touch something metal and grounded before you touch the RAM or the inside of the laptop to ensure that you are not carrying a static charge.  ,       Make sure they are all fully unscrewed so that the casing can be removed.

You have probably seen water form beads on a window or table. This happens because of the surface tension of the water. If you add a surfactant, the water will spread and wet more of the surface.Surfactants can be classified by their ionic properties or electrical charge: anionic (negative charge), cationic (positive charge), nonionic (no charge), and amphoteric (either positive or negative charge). Soap is anionic surfactant while detergents are made up of one or more surfactants of various charges.; , Detergents are made up of fatty acids and sodium or potassium salts. Triglycerides are compounds derived from animal or plant fats and oils composed of three fatty acids and glycerine.Fatty acids are weak acids composed of a hydrocarbon chain attached to a carboxylic acid group (one hydrogen, two oxygens, and one carbon).  , An alkali salt is a soluble, basic (pH > 7.0) portion of an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium. Alkali salts are able to react with and neutralize acids due to their basic chemistry. Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are the two most common salts used to make soaps and detergents.The alkali salt attaches to the carboxylic acid group to form carboxylate. The entire molecule of carboxylate and fatty acid is soap. These chemicals are very caustic and can cause severe injury if handled improperly. Sodium hydroxide is used to make harder soaps, while potassium hydroxide is used to make softer, liquid soaps.  , In chemistry hydrophobic compounds are ones that “run away” from water. They are not water soluble. Hydrophilic are “water loving” compounds and are soluble in water. Soap is unique in that it has a hydrophobic end (fatty acid chain) and a hydrophilic end (carboxylate).The hydrophobic end is capable of binding stains such as grease and oil that are also hydrophobic, while the hydrophilic end is attracted to water and allows the stain to be washed away.Detergents work better when washing with hard water (water with mineral salts) because they have multiple surfactants.  , To make a detergent, you need fat and sodium hydroxide. Fats can be obtained from animals in the form of tallow and/or plants such as coconut or palm oil. Sodium hydroxide is also known as lye and is an essential component for making soap.Sodium hydroxide, or lye, is extremely caustic and must be handled properly. Wearing gloves, goggles, and long sleeves is essential while making detergents.  , Because lye is a caustic substance, you want to use caution when working with it to avoid injury. When making a detergent, never make it near children or pets. Work in a well-ventilated area with open windows and doors. Because lye is a strong base, you always want to add it to the water. Adding water directly to the lye super heats the water and can cause explosions.Work near a water source to quickly clean up any spills. If you get any lye in your eyes, you must wash them for at least 15 minutes to make sure all of the chemical is washed out.  , The first step of detergent-making is called saponification. The fat and oils contain fatty acid chains and triglycerides necessary for the detergent. When mixed with the sodium hydroxide and heated, the glycerine molecules are removed and the sodium hydroxide combines with the carboxylic acid of the fatty acid.The resulting soap is a long chain of carboxylic acid., The detergent is not very soluble in salt water, while glycerine is highly soluble. Most of the glycerine is removed because it is valuable, although a little is left in the soap to make it smoother. When the salt is added the mixture separates into two layers: crude soap and brine/glycerine.The soap rises to the top of the solution while the brine/glycerine sinks to the bottom. This process is usually repeated multiple times to remove as much glycerine as possible.  , At this stage, the soap is not nearly as caustic as pure lye, but it is still too high to use. The base can be neutralized using a weak acid such as citric or phosphoric acid. The acid removes the remaining sodium hydroxide and makes the detergent safe for use.After neutralization, the soap is dried and then ready for use.  , The most important concept related to the chemistry of detergents is the fact that they have both a hydrophobic end and a hydrophilic end. To remember which part does what, remember that a phobia is a fear of something. Since hydro, refers to water, hydrophobic means “water-fearing.”If you can remember what hydrophobic is, you just have to keep in mind that hydrophilic is the opposite and means “water-loving.”  , Anionic detergents have a negative charge on the hydrophilic end while cationic detergents have a positive charge on the hydrophilic end. They are considered more harsh because they modify protein structures.Cationic detergents are also capable of killing microbes and work very well to neutralize residual anionic detergents molecules.Anionic detergents are commonly used for scrubbing floors.Cationic detergents are commonly used to wash clothes and in shampoo.  , Nonionic detergents are a subgroup of detergents that have no electrical charge. Because of this lack of charge, they do not react with hard water ions making them less useful for washing clothes. They tend to foam less than ionic detergents as well.They are generally used as dish-washing liquids.

"['name a star for its brightness within its constellation', 'name a star for its position within its constellation', 'name a star according to its right ascension and declination', 'without regard to its constellation']",How to Name a Star2," Around 1600, German astronomer Johannes Bayer developed the first modern system for naming stars based on their apparent brightness within their constellation. He used Greek letters to rank stars from brightest to dimmest (""Alpha"" being brightest and ""Omega"" being dimmest), followed by upper and lowercase Roman letters when he ran out of Greek letters. A star's name was composed of its brightness rank and the possessive form of its name, thus the brightest star in the constellation Centaurus was designated Alpha Centauri under Bayer's system.   Bayer's system did not always name stars purely by their brightness; sometimes he also took the position of the star within its constellation into account. Bayer designated Castor as ""Alpha Geminorum"" and Pollux as ""Beta Geminorum,"" even though Pollux is actually brighter than Castor, because Castor appears above and to the right of Pollux in the sky. Bayer's method was later modified by adding letters after star names to indicate individual stars within a multiple star system, such as Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, and numbers after the magnitude designator, as in Pi-1 Orionis, Pi-2 Orionis, and so on.  , Developed by John Flamsteed in the 18th century, the Flamsteed method numbered the westernmost star within a constellation as ""1,"" the next westernmost as ""2,"" and so on, using the possessive name as a suffix. The westernmost star in Leo would thus be designated 1-Leonis in the Flamsteed system.   The Bayer and Flamsteed naming conventions are often used in conjunction with proper star names. If a star has a proper name, it is generally known by that; if not, by its Bayer name; if it has neither a proper name or a Bayer name, then by its Flamsteed number. The main exception to this rule is Alpha Centauri, which is known by its Bayer name instead of its proper name of Toliman (and by aviators and mariners as Rigil Kentaurus).  , Because the system of proper names, Bayer names, and Flamsteed numbers favors brighter stars and ignores the larger number of dimmer stars, a different method was necessary to catalog all the stars in the night sky. This method involves cataloging a star by its right ascension, its distance from the vernal equinox, and its declination from the Celestial Equator. Such catalogs often break the sky into strips of either right ascension (celestial longitude) or declination (celestial latitude) and enumerate stars within these strips.   The Harvard Revised Bright Star Catalogue (now compiled at Yale University) lists 9000 stars down to 6th magnitude from west to east. The star Vega in the constellation Lyra is known as HR 7001 in this catalogue. The 19th century Bonner Durchmusterung (Bonn Survey) covered stars visible in the northern sky down to 10th magnitude, dividing each degree of declination into its strip. In this catalog, Vega would be designated BD38 3238. (A companion survey, the Cordoba Durchmusterung, covered the southern sky.) The most commonly used star catalog today is the Henry Draper catalog, which numbers its stars solely by right ascension. In it, Vega is designated HD 172167. Other star catalogs include the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observation and the Hipparcos International Catalogue; Vega is designated as SAO 067174 and HIC 91262 in these catalogs, respectively.

This will be the main engine you're going to be using for your scripts and parts. When opening ROBLOX Studio, you'll be greeted to an empty baseplate.       Insert a part. A part is any sort of brick or block on a said game. To the right, on the explorer, you'll see a brick named ""Part"".                If you don't have explorer opened, head over to the ""View"" tab on ROBLOX Studio, and enable Explorer, as this is a key component in making the trigger. While you're at it, if you don't have Properties opened, feel free to enable Properties. It can be found next to the Explorer tab.               When inserting a part into the game, click on the Part in the Explorer itself. The Part should be selected, if not already, and right-click on it. Scroll over to ""Insert Object"", and pick ""Script"".       Upon clicking on Script, you will be greeted with a code-like sheet, with the command ""print(""Hello, World!"")"". This is the most basic and widely world known command. It allows the computer to print the words, ""Hello, World!"". Delete the command, and here, you will start scripting the function.; , Because function is already defined in the ROBLOX database, you don't need to redefine it. Start off by simply printing out the function you will be using: function onTouched(). The end command should show up. This should be ignored for now, and you want to start working directly underneath function onTouched()., However, if you test the game out (F5), the computer won't do anything. This is because you haven't told the computer what to do. You just simply defined that something WILL happen when we touch this object., In this instance, what you want to do, is to create a directory to the part you want happen., The script should automatically have the ""end"" code after it., Workspace follows that, because that's what you can see in the Explorer as the first line of directory. Because Baseplate is seen inside Workspace, you only need to then direct it onto script.,, You want it so that once the Baseplate is destroyed, the script no longer works. This is similar to before, except for the directory. Like how we destroyed the baseplate, the Destroy() command will be used in this. The directory is pretty easy, and doesn't take long at all. Because you only want the script to malfunction upon usage, you can simply insert: script: Destroy()., If you place it above our previous line of code, the script will just destroy itself without doing anything to the baseplate., So, that's our main body of code done. But, when you test the game out, it doesn't do anything. Why is that? With any script, you haven't called our function. This is the key piece of code, otherwise everything wouldn't work, and it's the CallOut code. Coding is similar to an essay, you've done all of the introduction (functions), and the main body, but you're left with the conclusion. In this piece of coding, you need to redefine what we meant with onTouched., In this case, the Parent would be the Part, so that now the Part will be selected. To make something happen on touch, we want to use the special code, ""Touched"", and just connect it as whatever we called our function (onTouched). The conclusion should appear something as script.Parent.Touched:connect (onTouched), To recap, your script should appear something like this:",581,"['state', 'command', 'function', 'end command', 'workspace', 'part', 'error', 'object', 'note', 'step', 'previous line', 'first directory', 'roblox studio', 'computer', 'parent', 'piece', 'code', 'baseplate', 'something', 'overall roblox studio', 'script', 'game.workspace.baseplate', 'directory']"
"['embrace both good and bad emotions', 'learn to label what you’re feeling', 'pay attention to how different emotions feel in your body', 'see the link between your emotions', 'your thoughts', 'and your actions']",How to Know if Your Emotions Are Hurting Your Health2," Both positive and negative emotions are essential to living a balanced life. Consider this: if you did not know what sadness felt like, would you be able to truly enjoy happiness? Although negative emotions are uncomfortable, they are necessary for the full human experience—and, they also teach us useful lessons.Don’t suppress negative emotions like anger, shame, sadness, or embarrassment. The next time they arise, let yourself feel them. In addition to leaning into these emotions, you should also aim to find meaning in them. What are they trying to tell you? What can you learn from this experience? Just be sure to express difficult emotions in appropriate ways. For instance, if you are angry, it is more practical to scream in your car when you're driving alone, as opposed to punching the person who fueled your anger. Let out your emotions in adaptive ways like kickboxing, singing, or painting a sad picture.  , To minimize the impact your emotions have on your health, you must become more aware of them and what they are trying to tell you. You can do this by taking the time to name what you are experiencing. Labeling your emotions can shed insight into the deeper problem, and provide a foundation for an effective coping solution.Consider this scenario, for example. A man is publicly criticized at work. He goes home and shouts at his wife and children. They ask what’s wrong, and he says “I’m mad.” While mad might be correct on the surface, deep down he is also feeling some other emotions like humiliation. Getting to the core of what you’re feeling helps you devise a plan to handle these emotions.  , Self-awareness is also connected to knowing how emotions affect you physiologically. Identifying the sensations and locations where different feelings manifest in your body can help clue you into what you’re experiencing.   Learn how to find the connection between your physical body and your emotions by documenting what you feel during different emotional states. For instance, if you wanted to hang out with a friend and they were too busy, you might feel rejected or sad. This might feel like a lump in your throat or a knot in your stomach. Jot down a few adjectives that describe what emotions you feel throughout a week. Then, look back over your list to find recurring patterns. Trust yourself. You will get better with time and practice., Being able to recognize your emotions and their impact on your life is key to emotional intelligence. In addition to labeling emotions and figuring out how they affect your physical body, you also want to pay attention to how they influence your thoughts and behaviors.To carry the previous example forward, when you are feeling rejected, you might have tightness in your throat. You might also notice that your thoughts are “I don’t have any friends,” or “I’m a loser.” Then, you find yourself abusing alcohol or drugs to numb this feeling. Emotional awareness helps you identify the emotion and find healthier ways of coping with negative feelings. Instead of emotional numbing in the form of substance use, for instance, you might call up another friend to see if they are available or watch your favorite comedy to cheer you up.

It will also depend on the size of your yard and garden, and whether or not you have pets and other animals on your property.   Some animals, like earthworms and bees, actively improve your garden. Some, like butterflies, help your garden by looking pretty and not damaging it in the process. Some, like ladybugs, bats, spiders, and cats, eat or scare away others before they eat your garden. Not everything helpful to your garden should be encouraged into close contact with people, particularly children. You probably won't want a bee colony right by your house (but a beekeeper might volunteer to take it). Bigger animals might attack if too close, particularly if startled, even if you think they're tame.       Helpful animals include certain insects such as ladybugs and bees, insect-eating birds, earthworms (not in all places though), spiders (but beware of creating conditions, like woodpiles, particularly desirable to the few that can be dangerous), frogs, lizards, etc.       Animals that tend to be pests are those that have destructive habits and include rabbits, deer, mice, mosquitoes, squirrels, flies, aphids, moles, raccoons, possums, starlings, etc. However, it is really important to balance your sense of ""pest"" with the need to conserve local biodiversity and to be kind to fellow species. A mouse or a deer may be a pest if you gather many soft plants for it to eat. In its natural environment, including wilder parts of your yard, it can nibble down overgrown plants that would choke out a beautiful variety of species. Appreciate animals in their native regions as interesting, important parts of the web of life.      ; , Having more birds in your garden is beneficial for you because birds eat pest insects. In addition, people love watching birds set up homes, feed in, and fly around their own garden space, their intrinsic value being their beauty. Attracting birds to your garden will depend on the type of birds, as they'll all have their individual preferences, such as humming birds loving red flowers. Do research on the birds on your area and their preferences before purchasing and planting their favorite plants.   Read How to attract birds to your garden for more ideas.  , Butterflies are also attractive and most people are more than happy to have their garden filled with butterflies. Butterflies love a range of flowering plants, including buddleia, also known as the butterfly bush.   Read How to create a butterfly garden and How to attract butterflies for more ideas.  , Bees are the ultimate pollinators, vital to keep your garden, vegetables, and fruits growing strong. Attracting more of them to the garden makes common sense. Have many flowering plants in your garden, including lavender, to attract bees.   Read How to attract honey bees for some more ideas.  , Ladybugs feed on aphids and are excellent to have around your roses and other plants that aphids enjoy sucking the life out of. Ladybugs like the plant yarrow.   Read How to build a ladybug house for more ideas.  , Frogs eat insect larvae and insects, helping keep down the insect population; they are also excellent indicators of the health of your garden. Help make a suitable environment for them by providing a well cared for pond or by keeping a local stream clear of debris and pollution.  , Lizards eat a range of insects and they're enjoyable to watch as they sun themselves in the garden. Provide lots of hiding spaces for them by adding large rocks and nooks and crannies in your garden.  , There are a number of food solutions that you can produce for animals, especially during the leaner months of winter. Remember that it's important to feed the right food, and to not overdo the feeding. Some suggestions include:   How to make a bird feeder How to feed butterflies Leaving berries on the bottom of bushes for local ground-feeding wildlife to enjoy.  , What you may have considered a pest animal may turn out to be something you've allowed to happen, such as not using adequate fencing, planting the wrong plants, or leaving your garden too open, etc. If you can make the fixes and let wildlife be, then every being is better off for the space to live and be.   Remove invasive plant species from your garden. Often these are a cause of attracting unwanted animals and their further spread harms the local biodiversity.

Lightly blot the sheets to get as much of the liquid off as you can.Do not rub the stain as this will just make the liquid seep deeper into the mattress.; , Take the sheets off the bed right away and put them in your washing machine. Doing this will make it easier to remove any stains or smells on the sheets. If the smell of the liquid on the bed is really strong, you can add vinegar to the wash. The vinegar will help to remove the smell.If you are worried about the liquid staining the sheets, you can run the spot under hot water with a few dabs of laundry detergent. Then, wash the sheets as normal.  , Take the sheets out of the washer and smell them. If the odor is gone, put the sheets in the dryer on a gentle cycle. If the odor is still present, wash the sheets again using vinegar. Then, put the sheets in the dryer., Soak up as much of the excess liquid as you can on the mattress by blotting it with a clean towel or cloth. Blot the liquid until there is very little left on the surface of the mattress.Do not rub the mattress to remove the liquid, as this will just make the liquid absorb more into the mattress.  , Take a few teaspoons of baking soda and sprinkle it on the mattress. Let it sit on the mattress for a few minutes. The baking soda will help to absorb any remaining liquid on the mattress and remove odor.After the baking soda has been on the mattress for a few minutes, vacuum it up.  , Use an all-purpose cleaner for fabric on the mattress. You can also make your own cleaner by combining one part warm water and one part white vinegar. Spray the cleaner on the mattress and let it sit for three to five minutes.Make sure you cover all of the wet areas on the mattress with the cleaner. You can apply several layers of the cleaner to the mattress if the smell is strong.  , Use a dry towel or cloth to blot the mattress once the cleaner has been absorbed. Blot the entire mattress well. This will prevent mold in the mattress and ensure the mattress is as dry as possible., Sprinkle the mattress one more time with the baking soda. Then, let the mattress air dry for at least 18 hours. This will ensure the mattress has time to completely dry.You may need to sleep somewhere else for the night if you were planning on sleeping on the mattress. Do not try to sleep on the mattress until it is completely dry.  , Once the mattress has time to dry, use a vacuum to clean up the baking soda. You can then put the mattress outside or in an area with good ventilation in your home. This will allow any remaining smell to fade away.  Touch the mattress to confirm it is dry before you use it again. You can also smell the mattress to confirm the smell is gone.  , To protect the bed in the future, invest in a mattress cover made of plastic. The mattress cover will sit over the mattress and prevent liquid from absorbing into the mattress. You can find plastic mattress covers at your local hardware store or online., If you do not like the sound or feel of a plastic cover, you can get a washable protector made of breathable fabrics. The protector can then fit over the mattress and be washed in the washing machine when needed. Look for washable protectors for the bed at your local hardware store or online., Get bedding that is easy to wash and maintain, especially if there is a chance the bed will get wet in the future.

If you can't find sushi rice, or if you want a healthier option, try brown rice instead.The sushi rice does not need to have the extra flavoring in it.; , Just about anything that you'd put into a sushi roll or bento box is a safe bet for a sushi sandwich. This includes things like sushi-grade raw fish, fish roe, and cucumber. If you don't like sushi, you can use other items too, such as:Lettuce Shredded, pickled red cabbage Thinly sliced avocado Thinly sliced tomatoes Smoked salmon or sashimi Chicken katsu or pork tonkatsu Fried or baked tofu  , If you plan on making a chicken katsu or tonkatsu sandwich, you will need to fry the chicken or pork. Let them cool before using them. If you are using any fruits or vegetables, such as avocadoes, cucumbers, or tomatoes, cut them into thin slices. If you are using raw fish, make sure that it is sushi-grade first, then cut it into thin slices, like you would sashimi.  , Cut or tear off a sheet of plastic wrap that's bigger than your nori sheet. Place it onto your work surface, then place the nori shiny-side-down on top. Turn the nori at an angle with one of the corners pointing towards you. It should look a little like a diamond.  , Use a bamboo paddle to place ½ cup (125 grams) of cooked sushi rice onto the center of the nori sheet. Wet your fingers, then shape the rice into a 3½-inch (9-centimeter) square. The square needs to be right-side-up, with one of the flat sides facing you., You can also use vegan mayo or Sriracha. Add some seasoning, such as salt and pepper, if desired., Make sure that the ingredients all go in the same direction. Have them all point either side-to-side or top-to-bottom. Don't arrange them perpendicular to each other.   For extra flavor and texture, add some white or black sesame seeds. If you are making a sandwich using sushi-grade raw fish, consider adding some fish row.  , Use the remaining ½ cup (125 grams) of cooked sushi rice.

Dampen the corner with a wet finger, then fold the right corner over. Repeat the process for the top and bottom corners.Wrap tightly enough so that the nori is snug around the rice, but not so tightly that it rips.  , If you want to, you can add a julienned carrot (or a carrot matchstick) on top of the sandwich first. Make sure that it runs perpendicular to the ingredients inside. This way, the layers will look nicer when you cut the sandwich., You can also refrigerate it overnight. Some chefs recommend placing a cutting board, can, or box on top to help weigh the sandwich down.If you used raw fish inside the sandwich, it would be better if you ate it the same day that you made it.  , If you placed a julienned carrot on top of the sandwich, cut alongside the carrot, then remove the carrot.",537,"['plastic wrap', 'sheet', 'nori sheet', 'plastic sheet', 'sandwich', 'spread mayo', 'sandwich rest', 'ingredients', 'rice', 'top', 'minutes', 'nori', 'fillings', 'square layer']"

Décor is often a good indicator of price, so be alert. Tipping is not expected in Japan, so you can save even more by not doing so. It's a really good idea to have a menu-reading list on your smartphone or in your guidebook so that you know what you're eating and the value. And it pays to ask for meibutsu if you're a food lover––this is the word for ""speciality"" and will ensure that you get the most locally true cuisine possible.   Noodle bars and night street stalls specializing in noodles (ramen) are often a great way to get very full at an affordable choice. You'll know a ramen restaurant when you see customers seated at a long counter eating from steaming bowls. Udon and soba dishes are another cheap way to eat in Japan provided you choose a cheap restaurant.  Izakaya is the Japanese version of a pub-eatery, and you can get a selection of typical Japanese foods as well as Western foods as such places. It's casual food, and therefore usually fairly inexpensive.  Yakitori is a skewer of vegetables and charcoal-grilled chicken. It's usually served with beer or sake after work and it might be enough for a meal in some places. There are yakitori restaurants (yakitori-ya), often found near train stations. Just be aware that prices are usually for one yakitori, so add up the costs if you want more. Although sushi is considered to be a snack, it is possible to fill up on sushi as a meal. Look for automatic sushi places, known as kaiten-sushi, that serve sushi on an automatic conveyor belt. The color code on the plates you choose are the price indicators and they should match with a price chart on the wall. Choose carefully and you might be able to fill up for very little cost. Look for places where the locals eat, although you'll need a grasp of basic Japanese as such places rarely have menus and if they do, rarely anything in English. Look for nomiya and aka-chochin Japanese restaurants or chuka-ryori-ya cheap Chinese restaurants.  , Grocery stores sell plenty of prepared foods just like convenience stores but for a lot less money.  , These are almost everywhere in Japan and you can get a range of food and drink from them, including snacks, green tea, coffee, beer, etc.  , McDonald's and other fast food chains are everywhere. Try Mosburger, a Japanese hamburger chain.  , These are great budget places to eat, with lots of variety available. Along with grocery stores, these can be a great place for vegetarians, as there will be plenty of fruit, rice snacks and vegetables for sale.   Bakeries are another option, although most food sold in bakeries is fairly sweet and isn't going to be quite what you're used to.  , You might have heard that things in Japan are really expensive, however if you avoid alcohol and clothing you will find that everything else is quite reasonably priced. You should, of course, try sake while you are in Japan. Just don't plan on going out to bars every night.  , Convenience stores have great tasting, inexpensive pre-made meals. They have everything from prepared ramen to beef bowls. Some convenience stores even have fresh bakeries. Most will have microwaves and chopsticks and/or disposable utensils available. Many have counters where you can eat in the store, if you wish.  , They're cheaper and more personal than souvenirs or expensive artisan items, and they're the best way to jog your memory years later.

Practice these confidence techniques when you speak to your co-workers and bosses.; , Guys don’t typically shy away from physical activities and sports, so you can act like a guy by participating too. Some activities that are traditionally associated with guys include:Fishing Watching sports Biking Camping and hiking  , It seems that men are more willing to take risks when it comes to things like gambling and recreational activities, so part of acting like a guy can include being a little more willing to take risks than you might otherwise feel comfortable with.This might include:   Choosing to do something you know you might get in trouble for from your parents, such as playing good-natured practical jokes on friends and family. Just be careful that you don’t do anything illegal, because that’s not a good kind of risk. Engaging in activities where you could get hurt in a way that won’t be life-threatening, such as skateboarding, mountain biking, or trying weird new foods.  , Don’t be afraid to ask for something you want or need, and be specific about what it is. You can do this without being bossy or rude by still being polite and saying things like “please” and “thank you.” You can make your needs clear:   When you're at restaurants. Don’t let somebody else order for you, and be specific with the wait staff about what you want. For example, if you want your food a certain way, say “May I please have the veggie burger, hold the mayo, with a side-salad, and the dressing on the side. Thank you” When you're working on a project with others. If you know certain tasks need to be completed, don’t be afraid to delegate certain roles to your friends, co-workers, or classmates.Just make sure you're doing your fair share of the work as well! For example, you can say something like, “We’ll get this done faster if we divide the tasks. I will take care of the food preparation. Jill, can you handle the guest list? And Andrew, can you take on the decorations? Thanks everyone!” In relationships. Being clear about your needs means asking for help when you need it and telling friends and loved ones how they can best support you. For example, if you feel your significant other hasn’t been doing enough around the house, say, “I feel like I’ve been responsible for most of the chores around here, and I need your help. I’ve made a list and divided the housework between us, and I would appreciate if you could take care of the items on your list.”  , Assertiveness is all about being considerate of others while also expressing yourself.It’s compared to passiveness, where you allow others to tell you what to do, and aggressiveness, where you dictate to others.   You can be assertive by making your beliefs, feelings, and opinions clear to others without saying that someone else is right or wrong.During a school discussion, for example, you can say to a classmate, “I understand your opinion, but I believe that global warming is real and that it’s caused by humans because the scientific research backs that position.” Be assertive in all aspects of your life, including at work, with friends and family, in relationships, and in your dealings with strangers. For example, if a friend is doing something you don’t appreciate, you can say, “We’re friends and I respect you and our friendship. I would appreciate if you did the same, and stop calling me that name, because it’s rude and offensive.” Part of being assertive means being able to say “no” when you don’t agree with something, and standing up for the things you believe in. If someone tries to get you to do something you don’t agree with, just say, for instance, “I feel that everyone has a right to share this country, so I will not participate in your protest.”  , Men and women tend to walk differently because of biological, physiological, and social differences. To walk more like a guy, make sure you:Swing your hips less and your shoulders more Walk with your legs a little farther apart than you normally would Keep your elbows slightly winged out Project your head and chest slightly ahead so you're leading your walk with your upper body  , It’s always polite to have a firm handshake, but many people consider it even more important for guys than girls. To make sure you have a firm grip, don’t let your hand become limp when you're shaking. Keep your hand strong and engaged.   Don’t forget to make eye contact when you're shaking hands, as this is a sign of confidence and respect. A firm handshake is important any time you shake someone’s hand, including when you're first introduced, when you want to greet or bid farewell, or when you're congratulating.  , Again because of biological and social differences, men and women generally sit differently, and this includes on chairs, couches, seats, and on the ground.   To cross your legs, don’t cross one leg fully over the other. Instead, spread your knees apart a little and cross one ankle over the other. If you don’t want to cross your legs, keep your feet flat on the floor and your knees and feet slightly apart. When sitting, rest your hands on your knees or on the armrests.

"['choose the best towing option for your situation', 'use a trailer', 'think about using a tow dolly', 'try using a tow bar', 'find out about the other types of tow bars']",How to Prepare Your Car for Towing1," There are three basic options for hauling your car; it's up to you to determine which method best fits your situation. The three options covered in this article are: using a trailer, using a dolly, or using a tow bar.   The other option that is not listed in the following steps is using a strap, rope, or chain to pull your broken down car to the shop. This method calls for someone sitting in the car, working the turn signals, steering wheel, and brake pedal. If it's not an emergency, or if you have further than a few blocks to go, do not try this method, as it’s just not safe. If you have to tow your car in this manner, just remember to let the towed car handle the brake loads, and be sure to avoid letting your rope, strap, or chain get too much slack. You also need to remember to put on your hazard lights.; , The first, and likely least difficult, option is to use a trailer that allows you to raise all four wheels of your towed vehicle off of the ground. These are pricey to buy, but your local moving van service might have something you can rent. To use the trailer:   Drive, push or winch your car up onto the trailer. Lock your car down; there are generally strong nets you should place over the front wheels, and chains to ratchet down your rear axel.  , The next option is a tow dolly, which lets you get your front wheels up off the ground, letting the rear wheels roll on their own. These are especially handy for front wheel drive vehicles. As with trailers, drive, push or winch your car up onto the dolly. Wrap your wheels in the nets, and ratchet them down a little tighter than you think you need to. There may be a chain for your front axles, or a hook, even, depending on the dolly.   If you are using the dolly to haul rear wheel or four-wheel drive vehicles, you might want to disconnect the drive shaft, especially for long distance travel. The other option is to leave the towed car in neutral; for automatics, there is a consensus that this is a bad idea for long hauls, but when speaking of standard or 'stick' transmissions, opinions vary as to the necessity of disconnecting the drive shaft.  , The tow bar is a common, popular choice for RVers and toy haulers. It is often chosen for long distance travel. When using a tow bar, all four of your wheels will be left on the ground. They are much cheaper to buy than a trailer or dolly, and can be left on your towed vehicle (you'll see them on jeeps and buggies a lot) as a permanent part of the car’s setup.   The way you connect your tow bar to your car will depend on the model of bar that you use. Some tow bars connect to the frame of your car, while others hook to the front bumper. When you get to your destination, simply unhook the bar and you’re good to go.  , Tow bars also come in a variety that stays coupled to your towing hitch, and connects to the towed car via ""D-Rings"". It is put on in the same way, but can be removed more easily from the towed car, and you can generally leave the d-rings on without impacting your car's good looks if you are just moving it occasionally.   The third variety, commonly available from a moving company, just uses straps and pads to create a temporary hitch-able connection, which can be completely removed when you are done with your move, and requires no alterations to your towed car. Cushions press up against your bumper, straps wrap around your front axle or undercarriage, which results in a fairly solid, snug connection to your towing rig.

Appear worried on the night of a full moon. Remember, you have to change that night. Do not make people think that something really bad is happening and don't lie. So, just excuse yourself and disappear somewhere where no one can find you. (If you're younger, let your parents know, though or they might freak out and call someone.) Never stay around other people on a full moon night. If someone calls you when the moon is up, don't answer. But answer every time when they call you at other times during the month. That behavior will make it easier for them to spot that something is wrong with you and you have changed.; , Just make sure not to thrash out or terribly injure someone. Wolves are always very protective and help the pack in any way they can.  , This will depend on what wolf you want to be. The Alpha? Stand tall and walk with pride. Look up wolves and packs and ranks and how each rank acts. But every rank walks wolf-like. They can't help it because that's their nature. And since you are a werewolf, you're more used to that. It's like walking while wearing high heels. It will be uncomfortable, but it will not harm your feet and you will get used to it as you continue walking this way.  , Werewolves can look menacing and outright scary if they're angry. Practice putting on several different stares to perfect the impersonation.   One for your enemies. Make it deep and aggressive. Look straight into their eyes and charge around them. Smile at them with your mouth open. When wolves do that, it's a sign of challenge. The other one for your prey. Charge around your prey while observing very slight movement they make. Even if they move their feet a bit or just their finger. Spot it and make that clear. (Do not try smiling with your mouth open with this, since there is not going to be an equal fight. I don't mean that you are going to fight your prey or attack it, but that's how wolves are.) Last one, for interesting people and friends. Try to make it friendly and playful. Wolves are very playful with their friends.  , If there is no one like that, target your best friend. Creep around in places they are and stalk them, but don't scare them! Think that you are a wolf and you are their protector. Keep a close eye on them and make eye contact. In the beginning, they might be scared a little bit if they don't know you. But prove to them that you are a friend and make them feel safe around you.  , That will give an impression that you have been in the forest. If someone tells you, act scared and excuse yourself.  , Be sneaky. Keep your head a bit low and observe everyone's moves. Charge around them as if they are your prey.  , For example, curl up in a ball in a dark corner. Or lay with both hands and legs straight in front of you, like walking using all limbs. Except this time you're laying on your side.  , Don't break away from friends altogether, but if you were a werewolf you would feel more comfortable around canines. If you are hanging out way too much, you might also start smelling a bit like fur which is very good for your tries.  , Don't be cheesy though! Only do that if you're good at acting.  , Act angry and a bit worried. Give them the ""Enemy look"" and tell them never to bring up the subject again and leave. Don't get in a fight about it.  , Werewolves are known for their very hairy exteriors. If you want to start producing more hair (and you're a guy), you can try shaving and see if that helps you produce more hair.

How do the people treat each other and outsiders on an individual basis? Any out of the norm national or domestic traditions or practices? On a larger scale, what is the overall societal feel of the region? Perhaps it's coming apart at the seams from civil war, with roving death squads or maybe there's a tentative peace. On the other extreme it could be highly patriotic or religious, full of tight-knit, radical nationalists or zealots...        Fashion and Language: Decide how the people of the area dress, how they adorn themselves (popular jewelry, hairstyles, tattoos?), their language(s) and how they speak.        Calendar: What are some holidays, festivals or other popular observances?        Religion: What is the dominant religion, if any, and how powerful is the priesthood?        Art: Cover some artistic output and distinctions: music, high art and folk art, literature, folklore, theater, architecture...       Come up with one or two other societal and social aspects, like caste systems or major cultural taboos.        , Legal punishments and consequences. Are there any specific laws governing magic? Are servants and landholders free/serfs/indentured/slaves? What is the judicial system like, if there is one (a trial or hearings, representation, guilty-until-proven-innocent/vice versa, thrown in the dungeon and wait for the Holy Fruit Bats of Kayobish to decide...)? What other fundamental rights do people have under the law, again, if any (property rights, parental responsibilities, due process)? What are the rulers like?

What kinds of ""uncivilized"" humanoids live in the wilderness? Describe the major weather patterns of the region. How does the local geography and weather effect the populace, if at all (if it's a mercantile society are they coastal and sea-faring merchants or maybe land-bound nomad traders)? Create one or more encounter tables for the wilderness.  , Are there stone arches or canyons? Lush river valleys? A vast field of geysers? Forests, cave networks? A mile-high cliff or waterfall?

But somehow make a connection with another who feels or thinks very similarly and/or is very accepting to you as a person. This will bolster your own confidence in speaking up about your need to be accepted/respected by others. Often, once you have friends/family who believe similarly to yourself, you will feel supported enough to discuss openly your need for further social acceptance. Finding that accepting friend or family member might be achieved through seeking a social group or social network outside of your own neighborhood or family group.; , If it is at all possible, openly ask the family and friends you have about their acceptance of your beliefs and values. If you can ask for a conversation, you are already on the road to coming to terms about what it means for you to believe differently and still be able to successfully seek social acceptance.Sometimes once you establish your stance on certain beliefs or norms, others are more accepting than you might have anticipated. At the very least, you will have established their viewpoint rather than your assumption.  , Whenever you recognize resistance or especially if you experience open hostility for your beliefs, you must evaluate your position. Recognize, establish and accept your own need for maintaining social connections despite differences of belief systems. This will help you decide how much you are willing to do on your end of the relationship.  , Usually, sorting out your relationships is easier to do one on one.  , Take an understanding friend with you to any gathering where there is going to be heavy symbolism and/or rituals that are specific to others belief systems. Try to keep yourself open minded in how you react to these outward demonstrations of faith or values. Think of how you would react if you were attending the rituals of a tribe or group in a foreign country.  , You must accept yourself, respect your own need for sanctity of your beliefs as a first step in having others understand and respect you. Discreetly avoiding specific situations will not always be a viable alternative, but it is one tool that you can use at times to prevent open conflict in family or group gatherings.  , Also, ask permission to discuss giving the other person a chance to establish some control over the discussion.  , Review your feelings about how having your own beliefs which differ has affected your existence in the family/group/community. Be ready to discuss how you feel, without allowing the emotional impact of that feeling interfere with expressing your stance clearly. This is a difficult step. But allowing yourself to become demonstrably emotional while asking for understanding, can foster a weakening of your position. It can make your decision to stay rooted in your own beliefs seem less firm.  , Let them express openly how your beliefs and your stance make them feel. It is healthy to give them compassionate understanding, as that is exactly what you are wanting to obtain from them in return.  , You are, in fact, endeavoring to speak up about not just your right to have separate and distinct beliefs. You also are speaking up about your need for family and community relationships to be warmly experienced.  , This is the way to build a relationship with another on a firm foundation. You must find, embrace and remind them often of how very similar you are to them in many ways.  , If you are attempting to follow these steps to improve your relationships with family or community members then you are a fantastic human being who recognizes the importance of familial and communal belonging!

Do you have trouble with your character? Can you not read the lines clearly? Ask a friend for help.   Get into character.

If there's another source of noise - say, party revelers laughing and screaming - alert them to the situation and tell them to quiet down.   Do this quickly, but calmly. Don't yell at your guests; this will make the situation seem fishy, and possibly arouse the police officers' suspicion that something illegal is taking place. If illegal things are taking place, move them out of view of the front door immediately. Intoxicated party guests should go to another room.; , They are not allowed to enter the home unless they have a search or arrest warrant, they have reason to believe there's an emergency inside, or you invite them in.By stepping outside and closing the door, you make it clear that you have not granted them permission to enter your home. Note that local laws regarding the rights of police vary. Be aware of their rights in your particular situation. You might want to bring a friend outside with you, to serve as a witness for whatever goes down.  , Your tone with them should be conversational, but not overly friendly or casual. You are not required to speak to the police, but it can help defuse the situation if you're straightforward and easygoing about their visit., If they mention that neighbors complained your party was getting out of control, assure them that you will see to it that the problem is addressed. If this is the first time that evening that they have received this complaint, it is unlikely that they will be obliged to take further action, such as issuing a citation.   Avoid giving the police unnecessary details when answering questions. Say no more than you need to when you're discussing the situation. Do not lie to the police. If they ask you a question you're not comfortable answering, especially if it may get you in legal trouble, politely say that you decline to answer.In most states you are not required to show your ID to the police unless you're driving or being arrested. However, if the police ask for your ID and you feel comfortable showing it, there's no harm in making the process go more smoothly by handing it over. If you admit to any controlled substances being used other than alcohol, that may be enough probable cause for the cops to obtain a search warrant.  , In some cases the police may say they'd like to step inside and take a look around. They do not have the right to do this without your consent. State clearly and politely, ""With all due respect, I do not consent to having you enter my home.""If they ask ""Why not?"" then reply by saying that ""I can't let you inside without a warrant"". This politely but firmly demonstrates that you know and exercise your right to privacy inside your home. If you are uncertain about whether the police are giving you an order or making a request, ask them if you have to comply. If you are not obliged to comply, do not give verbal or written consent to let the police come in your house. Once you give them permission, they are allowed to thoroughly search the premises.  , If you don't comply with the order you risk getting arrested and/or entry being gained by force. By opening the door you're giving implied consent for them to enter, but in the end it's better to have your privacy invaded for half an hour than to be arrested and put in a cell overnight.  Do not admit to anything that would incriminate you. You have the right to remain silent; you should comply with the officer's request, but know when to stop talking. Never raise your voice or get belligerent with a police officer. This will certainly make things worse. If the police find illegal substances, know your rights. Tell them you want to speak to a lawyer.  , Send people home if you have to. The police are far less likely to be understanding if they are asked to come back a second time. If that happens, you can expect to get ticketed, if not arrested. They may even come back with a warrant in hand and some backup to raid the house. Don't risk it.

Despite airline regulations as to what temperatures the pet can travel in, the airport cargo area is likely to have temperature fluctuations. Carriers are generally not strapped down in case of turbulence. The carrier may be tossed and thrown like a piece of baggage. Delays can cause temperature changes in the hold that can injure or kill the animals. Even the best airlines have a statistically significant death rate for animals. Recognize that many airline employees are pet lovers and will look after your pet very well. Accidents do happen, though.   Some breeds of animals are more prone to problems when flying than others. Short-snouted dog breeds (like pugs and bulldogs) don't travel well in cargo holds according to a Department of Transportation report because their method of respiration prevents them from cooling down adequately. Some airlines even ban their travel during hotter weather.; , Have you considered...   Driving with your pet? Paying someone else to drive your pet to your new destination, whether it's a friend, family member, or pet transportation service?  Finding your pet a new home?  , By browsing forums online, you may be able to determine which airlines are the most reputable in terms of transporting pets. Read about other people's experiences. Keep in mind that people most often post their bad experiences, but not necessarily their good ones.  , What are their standards? Ask if the airline will insure your pet. If not, you may want to pass., Go for a nonstop flight if the trip is less than 6 hours. Otherwise, ask if you'll be able to see your pet during any changeovers. It is more likely to be possible at smaller airports than at major hubs due to security restrictions. Many airline employees are pet lovers, too!   Note: A ""direct"" flight may have stops before it arrives at the final destination. Only a ""nonstop"" flight is truly nonstop in airline language.  , It must comply with airline and government regulations. It should also be strong and spacious enough to accommodate your pet, especially if it gets bumped around during the flight. The regulations require that your pet must be able to stand up fully and turn around in the kennel without touching the sides or top. This is not negotiable with the airline.   Buy the carrier as early as possible and get your pet used to it. Give the pet treats inside the carrier and make it a comfortable, familiar place. Most US airlines require that you use a water dish that attaches to the door. It's less likely to spill. Even better, freeze water in the dish so it lasts longer. Tape your name, seat, and contact information on the carrier. If you have a cell phone, keep it on till the very last minute.  , If you see the carrier being mishandled or left in a hot or noisy area for too long, tell a supervisor or a gate agent immediately.  , Most large jets cool, heat and pressurize the cargo areas with the same system as the main cabin. If there is a delay, make sure to remind the the flight crew that your pet is on board so that the heat/cooling is not shut off to save fuel or power. Ask if they can check with the ground crew to make sure your pet is safely on board before the aircraft departs.  , A few seconds at the counter may save hours of grief for both customer and pet later on.

"['choose the drill', 'place the bead in putty', 'mark the hole', 'submerge the bead in water', 'touch the bit to the bead', 'slowly drill through to the other side', 'check your work']",How to Drill Holes in Beads1," You can use a hand-held rotary tool or a conventional cordless drill, but either way, the tool should be fitted with a drill bit no larger than 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).Note that smaller beads will require the use of even smaller drill bits. When drilling holes in glass or stone beads, you will need to use a diamond-tipped drill bit due to the hardness of the material. For wooden beads, a common drill bit or carbide drill bit should work well enough since these beads are made from a much softer material.; , Press the bead firmly into toy putty or poster putty. The side you intend to drill into should face up.   The purpose of the putty is to keep the bead still and stable as you drill into it. If preferred, a small clamp or similar surface could be used instead. Keep a thick layer of putter pressed beneath the bottom of the bead to prevent the drill tip from accidentally drilling into and damaging another surface. Holding the bead is not recommended. Due to the small size of the bead and the power of the tool, the tool could easily slip as you drill into the bead, injuring your hand in the process.  , Place a small dot on the bead using a fine-tip permanent marker. This dot should be centered directly over the spot you want the hole through.   The dot can serve as a guide for the tip of your drill bit. It is not strictly necessary, but it might help you keep the hole centered.  , Place the putty and clay in a shallow tray, bowl, or cup. Add enough water to the container to keep the bead just barely submerged.The water will help keep the drill bit cool as you work, thereby preventing the tool from overheating during the process. To further reduce the risk of causing damage to your work surface, you may also want to place the dish of water on top of an acrylic cutting board. Alternatively, you can place a thick leather pad into the container if the container is large enough and the pad is small enough. Note that this can be dangerous when used around corded drills, which is why a cordless tool is strongly recommended. No matter what type of drill or rotary tool you use, however, work carefully to avoid getting excess water on the tool. Never hold the tool with wet hands, either.  , Bring the drill bit down vertically over the bead so that it lightly touches the mark you created earlier. Turn on the tool for a second or so before switching it off.   If the tool is drilling into the bead correctly, you should see some of the material come off and mix into the water. Quickly check the surface of the bead when you switch off the tool. You should already see an indentation where the hole is supposed to go.  , Position the tip of the bit over the indentation and switch the drill back on. Gradually work your way through the entire bead until the bit comes out of the opposite side.   For best results, drill into the bead for one second, then pull the bit back up for another second. Drill back into it for another second and pull it back up for one more second. Repeat until you make it all the way through the bead.Drilling in this manner washes the hole as you drill it and puts less pressure on the bead. Less pressure means a smaller risk of cracking or breaking. Make sure that you drill into the bead at a straight, vertical angle so that the finished hole is even. Stop as soon as you feel the drill bit break through the other surface. If you stop too soon, you can always continue drilling the hole until you complete it. If you stop too late, you may damage your working surface. Depending on the depth of the bead and the material you're working with, the drilling process can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes.  , After you finish drilling through the bead, pull the bit all the way out and turn off the tool. Check the hole to make sure that it is even and clear.   If the hole looks finished, then the process is complete.  ",725,"['hole', 'bit', 'side', 'bead', 'drill', 'putty', 'water', 'work']"
"['set your budget', 'look for less renowned brands', 'avoid wines with high production costs', 'shop around', 'buy holiday-themed wine right after the holidays', 'buy in bulk', 'buy boxed wine']",How to Choose a Bargain Holiday Wine3," Choosing a bargain holiday wine means identifying what you mean by “bargain.” Are you looking for a wine under $35? Under $30? Under $15? Most bargain wines can be obtained for around $20, but you should customize your budget to reflect your own financial situation. Set your upper spending limit and only consider wines that fall below it., Brands that are very popular tend to be more expensive. If you’re looking for a bargain holiday wine, steer clear of popular brands, including:Black Box Yellow Tail Sutter Home Carlo Rossi Barefoot  , Wines that have high production costs and need a lot of fermentation time might be cheap, but they might not translate to high value relative to their taste. Many people find pinot noirs, for instance, too sweet and fruity.Grapes used to make Riesling wines, likewise, can be tough to grow., Different stores will often sell the same wine at different prices. You should check all your local wineries and liquor stores, as well as looking at places online. If you know the exact wine you want, you can save time by just calling the store and asking the price of the wine in question. If you’re looking at prices online, be sure to factor in the cost of shipping. Sometimes a dollar or two saved off the base price can be lost by a three or four-dollar shipping cost.  , After the holidays are through, many holiday items – including bargain holiday wines – go on sale. Buy some of these bargain holiday wines (and even some normally non-bargain holiday wines that have become bargain wines) and store them properly for next year., Buying wine in bulk will give you a better deal. If you’re ordering online, you’ll be able to keep your shipping costs down by ordering more (up to a point). Retail wineries might offer discounts on bulk purchases, too. Try to buy by the case (12 bottles), especially if you have a big holiday office party or plan on attending several holiday parties., Boxed wine is wine that comes in a big plastic bag inside of a box. Some people turn up their noses at boxed wine, but it’s inexpensive, and if you can find some that is appropriate for the holidays, you could get a great deal.Pour the boxed wine into personalized, decorated bottles. Then, obtain some empty wine bottles from an arts and crafts store and use a funnel to fill it with the boxed wine. Decorate wine cask with a label of your own making. Use construction paper to draw a logo and wine brand of your own invention. For instance, cut a strip of construction paper out and write “John’s Wine” in a florid script. Tape the label to the bottle. Your friends will get a kick out of it. If you’re really creative, you could paint your favorite winter characters, like a snowman, Santa, or Rudolph the reindeer.For an even more personal touch, instead of buying boxed wine and pouring it into your customized wine casks, you could make your own bargain holiday wine and bottle it for the holidays.

"['turn to family for support', 'find a counselor', 'attend support group meetings', 'appoint a guardian']",How to Avoid a Relapse into Addiction1," Your family and friends will want to see you lead a happy and healthy life. They are likely to be willing to help you through your recovery, especially if you show them that you are serious about ending the addiction. Reach out to siblings, parents, aunts and uncles for help. Try to line up several family members so that you will not be relying on just person. This can help you by providing you with more support and help your family by not overburdening one person. Asking family for a place to stay or a ride to appointments is often easier than asking friends or acquaintances.Avoid leaning on any family members that have the same addiction as you. This could lead you into a relapse. For example, you could call your parents and say, “I have been feeling pretty stressed out lately, and I’m afraid I’m going to relapse. I made an appointment for next week, but it would be great if I could be around support until then. Would it be okay if I come and stay with you for a couple of nights?” If a family member is reluctant to help you, try to be willing to listen to their reasons why and find out if there is a way for you to regain their trust.; , Recovery is a long process. The risk of relapse never completely goes away. To keep yourself on the right track, you should see a mental health professional regularly. They can help you learn to cope with stress and cravings, they will listen to your thoughts and feelings, and they can diagnose any underlying mental health issues that may contribute to a relapse.Ask your doctor for a recommendation to a mental health professional. Most doctors have a few facilities that they trust and work with often. You may have to see a therapist frequently at first, and then over time your visits will likely be reduced as you get healthier. Even if you are not seeing a therapist regularly, it is important to develop a relationship with one in case trouble develops.  , Support groups bring together people who have gone through a similar experience. In the case of your addiction, a support group will offer you a chance to share your story with other people who have battled the same addiction. You will also get a chance to hear their stories and encourage them.These groups provide bonding and accountability for people who have suffered addictions of a similar nature (e.g. alcoholic’s groups, drug addict’s groups, sex addict’s groups, etc.). This is an important part of your support system since most people will not understand what your addiction is like. There are also support groups for friends and family members of addicts, such as ALANON. Finding a support group has gotten much easier with the internet. Look for groups in your area that are specific to your addiction. You could also ask your mental health professional or doctor to refer a group to you.  , Many support groups offer a sponsor. The sponsor is a recovered addict that you have access to all day every day to help walk you through tough times. If you don’t have a sponsor, have a family member or friend fill the role. Explain to them that you need someone that you can call if you feel like you are slipping back into your addiction.Sponsors greatly increase the success of a recovery program. You can also authorize someone to place you in a rehabilitation program should you relapse.  ",591,"['support group meetings', 'guardian', 'family', 'counselor', 'support']"

If you've been eating or drinking, be sure you make an effort to assure your breath is fresh.   If you're at your own place or his place, run to the bathroom and make quick use of mouth wash.You can also invest in Altoids, mint gum, or breath strips. You can buy all these products at a drugstore or your local market.; , A good make out session progresses gradually. As you lean in to kiss, allow things to happen at their own pace. Pay attention to the man's reactions; try to get a sense of what he likes and dislikes. Start off at a slow tempo and then, as things get heavier, move quicker and start using your tongue, hands, and other body parts., Many people enjoy some tongue during making out. If the man you're kissing seems to enjoy tongue, then don't hesitate to use your tongue during the make out session.   If you want to allow the guy to take the lead, try opening your mouth slightly to show him you're interested. See if he initiates using his tongue., Sometimes, some mild teasing can really turn a guy on. In the middle of a kiss, pull back slightly and pull his head away from your face. Pause kissing for a few seconds and then resume. Many men get turned on by mild teasing during making out., Men, like women, have erogenous zones throughout the body. These are areas that respond sexually to physical contact. The neck and ears tend to have a lot of nerve endings. Try gently kissing or sucking a man's ears or neck during making out. This can be a huge turn on., The face is a sensual spot on a man's body. When making out, reach up and touch his face. Gently rub his stubble and rub his cheeks. Many men experience sexual pleasure through scalp massages, so try gently running your fingers through his hair as well., Before you begin making out, keep eye contact steady. This will show a man you're interested and can help turn him on. Smile between kisses. A man will be turned on if he pulls away for a moment and sees you smiling., Don't forget to use your hands when making out. Men will be turned on by gentle touching on the head, back, and arms.   Run your fingers over his back lightly. If he's not wearing a shirt, consider using your nails. Some men enjoy mild scratching.You can also touch his arms, legs, chest, and any other body parts that are easily accessible., Don't just use your face and hands during a make out session. Using your entire body can help turn a man on.   Lean into him as you make out. You can even push yourself on top of him or pull him on top of you. Try wrapping one of your legs around his or rubbing your foot gently against his thigh.  , The best way for healthy physical contact is to communicate openly. Talk to your partner about what he does and does not enjoy. Being open about your physical desires can lead to more enjoyable, intimate kissing.Many people initially feel uncomfortable when having to communicate about sexual desires. However, keep in mind open communication is an important part of any health sexual relationship. Try starting a conversation by saying something like, ""I really care about you and want you to enjoy our physical intimacy. Is there anything you enjoy when we're kissing I could do more?""

Show that you're not afraid to make a connection and that you're completely confident in yourself. Keep your back straight and your chin up, whether sitting or standing, and let your shoulders relax and pull backward. Great posture not only makes you look confident -- you feel it, too.   Making eye contact shows that you're confident and ready to take things to another level. Don't let anything sag, especially your shoulders and chin. Keeping these two body parts level and strong will help the rest of your posture fall into place naturally., This doesn't mean ""don't be friendly,"" it means talking about the relationships, ideas, and ideologies that make the world work, even if (especially if) it is the first time you meet people.

Don't be afraid to make people a little uncomfortable at first-- you'll be surprised how many people appreciate deeper conversations than ""how about that weather."" Follow your curiosities in a conversation -- don't tailor your topics to what is ""polite"" or right.  , Edgy people tend to stray towards the extremes when they have opinions. This doesn't mean you need to take a stand on every issue -- quite the opposite. Instead, get deep into the issues that really matter, becoming a passionate advocate and leader on the cutting edge of issues. For the rest, remove yourself. It seems paradoxical, but it is far more edgy to ignore an issue you know nothing about than to hop on a bandwagon and pretend.   Some opinions will be unpopular, such as what you think of your sister's new boyfriend or your political views. Just because your opinion is unpopular doesn't mean you should suppress it. Edgy people need to be well-informed about new developments and ideas, at least in your favorite subjects. Don't equate edgy with uneducated, even if you hate the education system.  , Don't mince words, offer half-thought ideas, or give compliments when you don't actually mean them.

However, decreased libido relates more to stress, comfortable habits in relationships, and poor communication. Though it may be awkward at first, have a frank discussion with your partner about your sex habits. Discuss your fantasies and listen carefully to your partner’s as well. Simply communicating openly about each other’s desires can help break old routines and breathe new life into your sex life.This is guaranteed to be healthier for your relationship and much healthier for you than an unregulated “miracle” drug.   Not only will an honest talk about sex likely reignite your libido, but if pleasing your partner is your concern, then honest communication can help you learn more about what your partner likes and wants out of sexual interactions. Ensure that you stay open to the feedback instead of becoming frustrated or defensive.  , Regular exercise to get in shape can improve your sexual performance for a number of reasons. Regular cardio will increase your stamina and endurance, including between the sheets.Additionally, shedding some excess pounds will make you feel sexier. Nothing can kill your libido like not feeling very sexy, and getting in shape goes a long way for self-confidence.   For men seeking enhancement products for penis size, a “beer gut” hanging down can also make your penis appear shorter than it actually is.In addition to the reasons above, exercising to lose some belly fat can also offer a more flattering appearance to your penis.  , Much of the perceived need for sexual-enhancement products related to penis size stems from a misperception regarding the average penis size. Actors in adult films can especially skew that perception for those who watch them. By realizing the actual average size, you can assuage some of the anxiety related to feeling improperly equipped. The actual average size of an adult male penis is:Between three and five inches (eight to thirteen centimeters) when flaccid Between five and seven inches (thirteen to eighteen centimeters) when erect  , For men who worry about penis size, bushy pubic hair around the base of your penis can make it appear smaller than it is.Try trimming down the pubic hair around the base of your penis, which will increase the visible amount of natural length.  , Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic floor and can help with delaying orgasm. If premature ejaculation is the issue for which you’ve been seeking an enhancement product, then try these exercises instead. A 2012 study showed that twelve weeks of regular Kegel exercises more than quadrupled ejaculation response time.The easiest version of this exercises is simply to squeeze the muscles that allow you to stop urinating midstream.

Make sure your back is neutral and your shoulders are rolled back so that your shoulder blades fall alongside your spine. Raise your arms overhead and press your palms together, fingers wide. Lean to one side as far as you can go and feel a good stretch. Take two or three deep breaths, then return to center and repeat on the other side.  , Chair pigeon pose is a good pose to add to your work yoga routine because it helps balance your hips and spine and gives your hips and inner thighs a good stretch.Sit on the edge of your chair with both feet on the floor. Make sure your back is neutral and your shoulders are rolled back. Bend your right knee and cross your right leg over your left so that your right ankle is resting just above your left knee and your knee is at a right angle.

Have four to five servings of vegetables each day. One serving is 1 cup of leafy greens, ½ cup of cooked veggies, or 6 ounces of vegetable juice. In addition, eat four to five servings of fruit a day.   Fresh produce is always best, but you can also have frozen fruit and veggies or even dried fruit (just watch for added sugar). Try veggie chips instead of regular potato chips. You can make your own at home with just a baking sheet and a little olive oil. Kale chips are an excellent choice, and much cheaper to make yourself than to purchase. Add fresh fruit to your oatmeal or cereal in the mornings. Or make a smoothie with frozen fruit and yogurt or milk. If you have more time to cook, try an omelet with your favorite sliced veggies. Double the amount of vegetables in recipes for soups, salads, and casseroles.; , White flour is basically sugar when digested. Instead of white bread and pasta, choose whole grain versions made with wheat, oats, brown rice, barley or rye. Whole grains offer nutrients that aren’t found in most fruits and vegetables, and eating three servings daily can substantially reduce your risk of heart disease.Try brown or wild rice instead of white rice. It’s better for you and adds a lot of flavor. Choose whole-grain cereals for breakfast, or switch to oatmeal some days.Read packages to look for foods with a whole grain as the first ingredient, or at least 8 g of whole grain content per serving.Cooking pasta al dente is a better health option as it takes longer to digest and functions as a good source of fiber in the diet., Eating too much sodium can cause high blood pressure and damage arteries. You should have no more than 2,300 mg of sodium a day.Buy fresh meats instead of packaged ones, like lunch meat. These typically have a lot of added sodium. Choose plain frozen vegetables instead of those with sauces or seasonings, and add your own flavors when you cook them. When eating out, request dishes to be prepared without added salt.  , Choose skinless chicken or turkey and ground beef that is at least 90% lean. Seafood and fish are great choices for protein, often easy to prepare, and leaner than meats. Vegans should include legumes, peas, nuts and seeds in their diet for adequate protein intake, and vegetarians can eat more eggs, too.   Try quinoa in soups, tossed with vegetables or in salads.Make sure you prepare them in healthy ways, too, like grilling, poaching, baking or roasting, instead of frying in oil.One serving of meat is 3 to 4 ounces, and you should have two or less each day.Red meat is ok to eat on occasion, but not everyday. Skinless poultry or fish are less fatty and generally healthier for people with hypertension.  , Dehydration can contribute to hypertension because it makes the body retain sodium.Drinking plenty of fluids also helps flush toxins from the body. Drink more than this if you live in a hot climate and when you exercise.   The amount of water each person needs is very individual. Elderly people generally need less than eight glasses a day, while overweight people need more water to help digestion and flushing toxins. Add one extra glass for each 25 lbs over your ideal body weight.Drink when you are thirsty and drink until you are not anymore, and you are probably getting enough. Increase your water intake gradually if you do not currently drink much. This will prevent placing high stress on your kidneys. When exercising, you need more. Drink 2 cups of fluid two hours before exercising, and water every 15 minutes while exercising.  , The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet recommends getting 150% more potassium than the typical American diet. Potassium is naturally found in potatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, kidney beans, bananas, avocadoes, fish, and milk.Eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day will provide enough potassium to help lower your blood pressure.      Avoid potassium supplements if you have kidney disease or take blood pressure medicines. Increasing your potassium intake sharply could be harmful in these cases, so ask your doctor for advice on how to add more to your diet naturally and safely.  , One tablespoon of sugar or jam and 8 ounces of sugary beverage both count as one serving. Don’t have more than five servings per week.Start reading packages to look for added sugars and choose regular versions of snacks instead of low-fat versions, which often have even more sugar to make up for less taste.   Drink flavored sparkling water instead of soda. There are many brands and flavors available and often they are calorie-free. Or, add some fresh fruit, herbs, and/or vegetables to regular drinking water to make it more fun. Mint and cucumber taste great together, as do watermelon and basil. Eat fruit with a spoonful of whipped cream for dessert instead of ice cream or pies. The natural sugar in fruit is much better for you and digests slower in your body. This is also an easy way to increase your intake of fresh produce, but make sure to leave skins on since they contain most of the plant’s fiber. There are 56 different names for sugars used in lists of ingredients (including dextrose, lactose, malt, sucrose, sorbitol, cane juice, rice syrup, molasses maple syrup, corn syrup, and glucose). If one is the first ingredient, or more than one type of sugar is included, choose something else.

Explain to your kids why it’s important to you and their grandparents. Make sure you talk about tangible benefits appropriate to their age and developmental stage.   Try saying, “Bobby, I am excited you want to spend time with Grandpa. I used to go horseback riding with my Grandpa as a child and those were some of the best moments of my life.”; , Let your kids play a role in deciding how and when they will bond with their grandparents. Ask them to come up with a list of thing they love to do that they think Grandma would enjoy as well. You can also try asking your kids to write down things Grandpa might be able to teach them.  , Having a weekly meal where your children and their grandparents can get together and talk about the week’s highlights is a great way to encourage bonding between your children and their grandparents. If the grandparents are open to it, invite them to take turns hosting the weekly event. You can even encourage your children to help their grandparents prepare a dish for the occasion.   If the idea of a weekly dinner seems overwhelming, try a monthly gathering where everyone brings a dish or two to share. This will relieve pressure on both guests and hosts.  , Chances are your children are involved in a host of afterschool and weekend activities. Whether it’s a football game, dance recital, or the school play, encourage your children to invite their grandparents to share in these important moments with them. You should also extend the invitation yourself to ensure the grandparents feel welcome at these events.   If your kids are involved in sports, try giving their grandparents a copy of their game and practice schedule. This will allow the grandparents to plan ahead and participate more fully in such events.  , Many grandparents have busy schedules of their own. This often includes working full-time. It can be difficult for them to manage their own schedule as well as those of your children. This is why it’s important to keep inviting them to events and opportunities to get involved in your children’s lives. Just because Grandma couldn’t make it to the ballet recital last month doesn’t mean she won’t be excited to attend this week’s baton-twirling extravaganza., You will need to be clear about rules the children are expected to follow, and may need to ask the grandparents to childproof their home for younger children. Approach the topic in a friendly way by first thanking them for spending time with your kids. Let them know what your rules and expectations are, and listen to their responses while holding back your judgment.Try saying, “Dad, I’m really excited that you will be watching the kids after school this fall. We have some rules the boys need to follow. Do you think we can work together to make sure they follow them at your house, too? Make suggestions for childproofing. Try saying, “Mom, would it be possible for you to put childproof locks on your kitchen cabinets? I’m more than happy to buy and install them for you.”  , If the grandparents do not have a close relationship with your children, knowing how to interact with the children may be awkward for them. Giving the grandparents some encouragement may help.   Try saying something like, ""Dad, thanks for putting that puzzle together with Jake. I know he really enjoys spending time with you."" Or, ""Mom, I know it's hard to connect with Jenna at her age, but you're doing a great job.""

It's as simple as it sounds, but at times (depending on the subject), is complicated and large. Being bizarre is, sadly, complicated and large. Hence why not allot of humans share that factor very boldly. Know that there are people that like this stuff, and are also very famous. This is because they're so different, that it's special. Do you want to be special? Not in the mental way, of course, but rather in the emotional way. Being special is doing something that someone else has a hard time with, easily. In this case, that ""something"" is being bizarre.; , Picking your nose is, as humorous as it sounds, not bizarre. It's weird. If you think of bizarre, think about something out of the ordinary, or out of place. Something that stands out in a strange way from the rather ordinary crowd. If you think of weird, think of sticking you finger in a place that is, well, inappropriate for you to be sticking it. It be your nose, it could be you butt. It doesn't have to be connected to you, either. It can be someone else's nose, and, as nasty as it sounds, it can someone else's butt. Gross, isn't it? Bizarre is a culture, weird is not. Remember that if you want to stand out in a good way, say that your mind is ""bizarre"", rather than ""weird"". It not only sounds more interesting, but it's a more formal way to put it.  , Do you want to be bizarre to be different, or do you think a more interesting approach? You probably can't really answer this question that well, and just say ""I want to be bizarre because I want to."", and that is a good answer, too. This, actually, could be an optional step if you don't want to fry your noodle just yet.  , This is a very vital step in this guide. Culture can be Japanese Anime, Surrealism, Pinatas,anything that your own culture doesn't normally have. This article is written English, which is the most popular language in America.

You can still go through the motions of a trick without rolling on cement. Practice somewhere like a garage and use a railing to hold onto.   You can also practice tricks while sitting down. You just need to make sure that your board has enough space to move.; , Place your front foot directly above the front wheels with your toe pointed slightly out. Next, place your back foot on the edge of the board with your toe slightly overhanging the tail, also with your toe pointed slightly out. Last, center your body weight above the board., The shove it is a simple trick that relies on the friction created from your feet. The idea is that you move each foot in the opposite direction. With enough force from your feet, the skateboard will spin at 180 degrees. If done correctly, the board should rotate and land on an even line. It is best to practice while holding onto something because you jump off your skateboard while the board spins.          You control most of the spin, or the ""shove,"" with your back foot. Your back foot has more influence than your front foot. You are definitely at risk of hurting yourself once you land on the board after it spins., Once the board is spinning, it is important to land on the board when after a 180 degree rotation. Pay attention to where your feet land. If you do not balance your feet onto the board after the rotation, you could fall. Watch how the board spins and practice getting the board to land as close to where you started.          On the landing, attempt to balance your feet by placing each foot on the opposite end of the board.  , Use the same location you attempted the trick with railing, but this time don’t hold onto anything.   If you fall, you are learning. Falling is a requirement for learning how to skateboard. Practice until you land the trick without holding onto anything for support. Eventually move on to practicing the trick while rolling. This will be the true test of whether you can do the trick. Many skateboarders think that you’ll get better faster the sooner you begin practicing your tricks on the move.  , Try to find a patch of concrete that is smooth. The best way to undergo this trick, at first, is at a slow speed. Start with two pushes and then prepare to do the trick.          Wear a helmet if you are scared of jumping on and off your skateboard.  , Place your front foot over the front bolts or even a little farther forward. Have your back foot between the back bolts and the tail. Before a trick, it helps if you crouch down and bend your knees. There isn’t one position you should take for this trick. All skaters perform tricks in their own style.          If your footwork is different from the recommended setup, then try it out. You should strive for comfort.Once you get used to it, start to place your front foot closer and closer to the middle of your board.  , Without stomping the tail, use your back foot to shove the tail to your heel side. Use your front foot to help turn the board. Jump in the air as the board starts spinning. When you see the tail come around (i.e., when the board has spun 180 degrees), extend your legs and land on the board.          Try not to land both feet on one side of the board or you will fall. While in the air make a conscious effort to place each foot on different sides of the board.  , Skateboarding takes hard work and determination. You probably won’t be able to land the trick after trying 10 or more times. Eventually you will find a way to modify your technique to land the trick. The goal is to land the trick 4 out of 5 attempts. You should expect to fall when practicing a new trick.          Use your weight to balance the impact of landing.Wear knee pads, elbow pads, and any other protective equipment you think you may need.

It's easy to see that the cards will come to you in this order: A 4 7 10 K 3 6 9 Q 2 5 8 J, then back to A.  , For example, four players gives you the sequence: A 5 9 K 4 8 Q 3 7 J 2 6 10, and five players gives you the sequence: A 6 J 3 8 K 5 10 2 7 Q 4 9. You should either memorize these sequences, or be able to figure them out quickly in your mind, by counting as in step 2.  , For example, there are four players, it's 9's to you, and you have only A's, 6's, and K's. what do you play? Well, look at the four-player sequence. K's are coming up on your next turn, so hold on to your kings. That way you can play them without having to lie. (See step 1). Neither 6's nor A's are coming up very soon, but 6's are coming a bit sooner, so you would be wisest to get rid of your A's. Who knows, by the time you get to 6's, you may be almost out of cards.  , How many? Well, it depends. You're claiming to be playing 9's, so try to remember where the 9's are. Especially if it's late in the game, chances are someone has all four of them. If so, it doesn't matter what you do, they'll call BS anyway, if they're still awake. So you're kind of screwed. If you're pretty sure that one person has two 9's and another has the other two, then you can play up to two non-9's. If someone has three 9's, you can play only one. This is only a guideline. Exactly how many you play will depend on several things, like whether your opponents call BS all the time, or very rarely, how big the pile in the middle is, how close you are to winning, etc.  , Otherwise, you might be letting them win, when you could instead be forcing them to keep playing. NOTE:If your playing elimination style you may want to wait for another person to call it so it doesn't hurt you.  , When everyone at the table simultaneously shouts ""BS!"" at you, be sure to have an arrogant smug look on your face as you turn the card over to show them that you've won.  , Plan this before your turn comes up. If you mess with your cards too much, people will suspect. Put your cards down in a clean stack, so no one can tell how many cards you've put down. Also, be sure to put the extra cards down underneath your four-of-a-kind; that way, if someone calls BS, you may be able to get away with just turning over the four legit cards. If you're still caught, exclaim that you made a mistake and you actually meant to put only four cards down. This trick can work with three-of-a-kind, or even with a pair, but the fewer cards you're claiming the more noticeable the extras will be.  , Won't work if the other person has the specific card and knows for sure you are lying.  , This works with seriously gullible people and they actually take the pile. But if you're caught no one will trust you again throughout the game.  , If they know you have less cards, they'll call cheat on you.  , This way, if they are cheating, the pile is less for you, and if they are not, then you are still going to end up with the same amount of cards you would if you didn't call cheat/BS.  ,, This will make the other people think you are cheating. WARNING: this only works if you have a serious expression throughout. Also, as with all tricks with this game, don't overdo it.  , it's real easy to get called when you look at you're hand and let out a few words that even shock people playing bullshit.  , People will assume you are bluffing and that you accidentally forgot that jack comes after 10 and someone will most likely call BS on you.

So, the 10 inches (25 cm) becomes 22 inches (55 cm). The way the purse is put together, there will be 3 pieces sewn together, not including the strap. The front, bottom, and back will be one U-shaped piece, hence the doubling of the size and adding an inch to allow for the bottom of the bag and an inch for hemming.  , Start below the seam that connects the leg of the pants to the waistband and go down 22 inches (55 cm). The goal is to have the back pocket in the center of the purse front. This turns out to be awesome for days that you wear pants without pockets! For the width of the purse, take the 10 inches (25 cm) and add an extra inch (2.5 cm) for hemming.  , This illustration shows the cut piece, with the back of the purse facing up. Put a book inside to make the shape a little more apparent. At this point, flip about a half of an inch over on the top of the front and back and pin those in place. You'll want to sew in a hem around the top, as most fabrics will start shredding like crazy otherwise. You can sew it by hand, but it's easier to run it through the sewing machine.  , Each side is a 10.5 inch (26.5 cm) tall, 3 inch (7.5 cm) wide strip of corduroy. Cut so that the lines run parallel to the rest of those on the purse. 3 inches may sound small, but it's not a deep purse, because of its fairly saggy nature. You can adapt it to whatever you put in it.  , That way, the fabric won't decide to unravel on you.  , Typically, you'll sew an item inside out, so that knots and seams are hidden inside of the finished project. Line up one side piece with the front (or back) of the main piece such that the long sides are next to each other. Make sure that the tops of the side and the main piece are lined up and pin them in place. Work your way around the side piece, so that the front, bottom, and back of the bag are pinned to the side. Then do the same on the other side. Check the picture for more direction.  , After all the pinning is done, run this through the sewing machine, one side at a time. It's not a bad idea to run it back through on a back stitch setting, to reinforce the stitches.  , Next, add the zipper.  , Before you buy one, check the zipper that is already on the pants to see if it'll be long enough to allow you reasonable access into your bag. If so, use a seam ripper to carefully remove the zipper and its permanent backing from the pants.  , There should be about an inch gap on each end between the zipper and the side of the purse. This will enable the purse to have holes small enough to drop a pen or keys into the purse without having to unzip the whole thing.  , Be sure to reinforce with a back-stitch.  , Decide how long a strap you want to have on your purse by judging with your measuring tape. For this pattern, there is a 48 inch (1.25 m) strap so that the purse can hang right about hip level. Use the front of the pant leg to cut two segments for this piece that you have sewn together. Go with a 3 inch (7.5 cm) width on the piece, so that you have a nice, thick strap.  , Then sew the two hems together for strength and a nice squishy shred resistant strap.  ,",697,"['edge', 'top', 'hand', 'creation', 'place', 'back', 'side', 'sides', 'side piece', 'voila', 'purse', 'long zipper', 'pants', 'complete purse', 'machine', 'strap', 'cm', 'long edges', 'zipper', 'good side', 'fabric', 'inch', 'inside', 'things', 'mm', 'front']"

You can talk about shared interests, or your life outside of work. Be friendly, and avoid seeming frustrated.Asking them about their life shows you’re interested in them as a person. You can say something like, “How was your weekend? Did you get to spend some time with your family?” You can let them know how you’re doing. This can also be a way to introduce the idea that you’re having a hard time focusing. You can say, “I finally got some rest this weekend. I’m hoping that will help me have more energy and focus this week.”; , Before you assume that they’re the one causing all the problems for you, find out how things have been for them. You may learn that they’re having a hard time focusing, or have been frustrated by something you’re doing.Really listen to your colleague’s answer and consider what you can do to help make their working environment better. For example, they may be making a lot of noise to block out the sound from another department. In that case, the two of you could approach that department together. It’s possible they haven’t had any difficulties in the workplace. They may just not realize that their noise is disturbing.  , Avoid sounding like you’re complaining. Focus on the ways that their noise is preventing you from being productive in the workplace. Make sure they know that this isn’t just about your personal preference, it’s about your ability to do your job. You can say something like, “I can tell that listening to music doesn’t bother you while you’re working, but I have a hard time focusing when there’s music on. And I hear your music very loudly at my desk.” Be honest without expressing judgement. For example, instead of saying, “You shouldn’t be taking loud personal calls while you’re on the clock,” you could say, “I’ve overheard a lot of the personal calls you’ve made lately. I don’t want to feel like I’m eavesdropping, but it’s actually hard for me to tune it out, because of your volume.”  , You don't want to make your coworker feel awkward or embarrassed, since you have to see them everyday. Make sure they know that it's not personal. Point out ways that external factors contribute to your difficulty with the noise.   You can blame the situation on your own difficulty focusing, on the office acoustics or cramped quarters, or anything else in order to avoid blaming the person or making them feel as if you think they are inconsiderate. You can say something like, ""I know it's not your fault. The walls here are ridiculously thin. But that ends up meaning I can hear everything you're doing in your office.""  , A signal is a great tool for keeping the dialog around noise open. This way, you’re not telling your colleague that they must be absolutely silent at all times. Instead, you’re creating a way that they can learn to gauge when they’ve gotten too loud.If your work setup is such that you can see each other, you can use a hand signal, such as thumbs down, waving, or pointing to your ears. If you can’t see each other, but have phones or computers handy, you can send a text or message simply saying, “volume” or “shhh.” Be sure to agree on the text of the message ahead of time, so your brief messages don’t come off as rude.  , This helps them know that the conversation wasn’t personal.

Buy a notebook or a three-ring binder. If you want a simple color or pattern, go for it. If you want something complicated and extravagant, go for it! You can buy a plain black notebook and make your own title page. Review the clothing in your wardrobe.; , Create complete outfits using the clothing and accessories you own. Remember to include shoes, jewelry and bags. Some items may be used multiple times. Be creative and try paring different items up. You may be surprised by some of the outfits you are able to put together.  , You can cut out clothes that you like and stick them on the cover, or draw your own designs on it. You could just put something simple on the cover, such as, ""My Fashion Book"".  , You can take photographs of yourself wearing the outfits, have a friend take photos for you, take pictures of individual clothing items or style outfits onto a mannequin and take photos. Print the photos. If taking pictures of individual items, create complete outfits using the individual photos.  , You'll need lots of magazines for this project. You'll specifically want to have style and fashion magazines, such as 'InStyle' or 'Elle'. You could also use gossip magazines such as 'Seventeen' or 'M' and use the outfits that the celebrities are wearing.  , Organize by theme and appropriate location (casual weekend, work clothing, party, wear at home or workout), as well as by season. For outfits that fit more than one category, consider making a duplicate copy of the photo and placing one in each section.  , Cut out pictures from the magazines. Cut out the clothes, accessories, and shoes that you like. Cut out things that celebrities are wearing (if you like them). Once you've cut out everything you want, move on to the next step.  , Divide the book up using tabs, page markers or dividers and label them to make it easy to find outfits for specific themes or seasons.  , A glue stick is the best thing to use for this step, but white glue works too. Glue the outfits onto the pages of your Fashion Book. You can combine pants, shirts, and hats from different people and make them into one outfit, or simply display each article of clothing on its own. It's best to only have 5-8 articles of clothing per page, and have them spaced out, rather than filling the whole page with outfits and making it look cramped and busy. However, this is your fashion book, so feel free to do whatever you want.Add notes to the book to include important details about outfits. If you want to remember that you wore a specific cocktail dress to an event, write it down. If you want to wear specific socks with a pair of trousers and they're not shown in the photo, write it down. Notes can be added on sticky notes, labels or by inserting them into their own sleeves.  , It's kind of boring to only see pictures of clothes in your fashion book, so why not personalize it? Color the pages of your fashion book. Draw designs like butterflies, spirals, flowers, etc. on the pages and around the designs. Draw frames around the outfits if you'd like.Find inspiration and go with the flow!

"['select a location', 'mitigate any risk and to enclose the wither into a safe area', 'summon the troops', 'seal them up', 'time for battle']",How to Kill the Wither in Minecraft Without Taking a Hit," There are multiple options but typically there are a few things you want to watch out for. Firstly, Lava is not your friend. this can result in the worst case a loss of the nether star and a waste of your three wither skulls. While you can build underground, the safest bet is to take it on at the surface. In particular look for a large patch of gravel, these are often found on the tops of some areas of extreme hills biomes. The gravel is useful since there is then very little risk of the Wither blowing a hole under your feet and making you fall down a chasm to your death.; , You could make a box out of something which is extremely blast resistant, furnaces or obsidian work well enough. The box will need double thick walls, so make a box of obsidian with external dimensions of 7 x 7 x 7 and internal dimensions of 3 x 3 x 3. Leave the roof off for now. Make sure that it includes a double thick floor to ensure everything works as planned.  , This will require 108 iron blocks.But first build the soul sand part of the wither and add the 2 side heads, leave the middle one off.  Now build a platform which is level with the top of your obsidian ""killbox"" and construct the first iron golem. Then push the golem (without hitting him) into the killbox and make sure he falls into the bottom. Repeat this method until you have 3 very cramped iron golems stuck in the box right next to the wither.  , Cover the roof in the first layer of obsidian leaving a single empty block in the middle. Now build up the last layer and leave the middle block empty and a single block on the opposite side to the wither. This will allow you to crouch and just place on the wither head when you're ready.  , First, throw in a splash potion of regeneration, followed by a splash potion of strength. This will give the Golems a fighting chance. Now put the last wither head in place and stand aside. Get your bow at the ready in case something goes wrong, You don't want a stray wither following you around the world. So what happens now is, the wither will anger the iron golems with its initial explosion which will then start pulverizing the Wither. The wither should be dead within a few short moments, typically around 6 seconds. This will damage the obsidian box, sometimes to the point where the golems will be set free, if you want to reuse the box for future wither kills, then stop the golems from escaping with simple cobble walls so they can be ushered back in later. Another tactic which works if you have fast hands is to keep dumping splash potions of healing into the box from the top, these will hurt the wither while healing your golems. Although this is risky if the Wither pops the block you're standing on you're going to fall in and its your only hope is to not attack (since you will end up enraging the golems).

"['strengthen your chest muscles with push-ups', 'parallel bar dips and bench pressing', 'do chin ups or rowing motions for your upper back muscles', 'do pulling movements with a view to improving strength when moving the arms', 'use the strongest parts of your chest muscles', 'do plenty of grip work']",How to Train for Ripping a Phone Book in Half2,"   For bench pressing, keep the reps low but more than five reps. Obviously, the lower pecs come into play and the decline bench presses and parallel bar dips work the lower pecs. For push-ups and dips increase the repetitions for added strength. Although the resistance, in a push-up, is the same (your body weight), your maximum bench press for five repetitions would be more if you could do 75 push-ups versus 25 push-ups.  , Again, keep the reps low for strength. There is a fine line between upper body exercises like dips and chins in terms of muscles used: both these exercises use the chest and upper back muscles.   Include some curling if doing rowing instead of pull-ups. Absolutely do curls if doing bent over rows, but if doing inverted rows omit curls if your biceps are getting a workout from this row variation.  ,   When doing any pulling movement, stop the lift when the upper arm is in line with the body as shown in diagram A. As a cool down set, use a light weight and pull your arms to past your body line as shown in diagram B, for a full-range movement. Muscles can only pull (in this case, the prime mover is the latissimus dorsi or lats or wings) so when the upper arm passes the body line, the lats are out of play. This can be applied to pull-ups, rowing, chin-ups, pull-downs, and any pulling movement. So, if you are doing a rowing movement (or chins) like in diagram B, you are lifting too light, so add some plates (or an extra repetition or two) until the end of your lift is like that shown in diagram A. Think about your technique for book ripping and apply your muscles in the angles that they are at their strongest. When doing the initial rip, think of this as a big lat and chest movement primarily instead of an arm movement to impart the maximum strength. Also, add exercises for small muscle groups that are not directly stimulated from doing the multi-joint exercises and which would help to make your book ripping stronger.  , In the bench press, the decline variation is stronger than the prone or incline. With the arms (triceps), the partial movement to full extension is very strong. When ripping a phone book, use your chest and arm muscles at their strongest range.   Note: although the chest muscles are strong in the decline position, the prone position (the flat bench press) has a higher weight lifted because of stability issues (sliding off the bench head first while in the decline position).  , Ripping a phone book demands a strong grip, so do two types of grip work: 1) thick bar lifting or pinch gripping and 2) lever bar lifting. To strengthen the grip in all fingers, the simplest way is to use a thick-handled dumbbell or barbell. A normal diameter bar is 1 1/16th inch, so lift with a thicker bar than this. Notice the rotation movements when doing lever bar movements. Besides the basic rotating movement with the weight on your thumb side of your fist, do a variation with the weight on the little finger side of you fist. When doing forearm rotations with the weight on the little finger side, be careful to avoid momentum movements because this variation is prone to momentum taking over the movement.

"['allow your child to do things for themselves', 'introduce your child to new experiences', 'let your child take healthy risks', 'give your child responsibilities', 'avoid putting too much pressure on your child']",How to Build Children's Confidence2," Depending on the activity, children can learn a lot more by doing it themselves--making a sandwich, feeding the dog, or setting the table for dinner. Though it may be messy and take more time, it can also be greatly rewarding for your child's confidence.Patience is key to helping your child grow in confidence. Give children the time and space to try something new and learn from their mistakes. Provide help when they ask rather than doing the project or activity for them. For example, your child is interested in pouring their own glass of juice into a cup. While they may be able to do so, but with some difficulty, you may at first want to do it for them. Take a step back and help them learn to pour their own glass. Even if they make a spill, you can teach them what to do when a spill happens. Use this as a teaching moment.  , One way to foster confidence is to see and do different things with your child. By sharing in these new experiences with them early on, you can teach them that life is not so scary or overwhelming as it may seem. Spend quality time with your child after school or on weekends in places that are different than your usual routine.   The experiences don't have to be expensive. It about building your child's interest in your community, in nature, and in learning. The more that they see and do, the less small or isolated they may feel. Go a different park or library than usually do. Take them to a natural history museum. Go to a state or national park. Take them to a restaurant with food they've never had before. Show them a community garden. Take them to a farmer's market. Take them to a sporting event that you both don't usually watch or attend. Teach them about giving back. Take them to a local food-pantry to sort cans or donate goods. Bring them to a retirement community to spend time doing activities with older adults. Join in a charity walk that helps a local non-profit.  , It is important that your child learn about how certain risks can help build confidence. In tough situations, we take chances, make choices, and learn to take responsibility for those decisions. This is the same with children.Foster your child's resilience and curiosity by encouraging them to try new things. When your child makes age-appropriate choices, they will feel more confident. Be mindful of risks that may harm versus healthy risks that can be teaching moments. For example, if your child feels shy in front of large groups, encourage them to enroll in a theater class. Help them use creativity to overcome their fears. Even if it's a small part with a few lines, they can feel more confident about being in front of people.  , For young children, they may want to be helpful and show that they can do things. Consider giving them chores around the house that may match their strengths.For example, if your seven year old child likes to organize things, ask them to help with sorting clothes and putting them in piles. Or if your ten-year-old like cars, have them help you wash the car or clean the interior.  , Avoid blaming them if they aren't living up to your expectations. Remember that their confidence may be based on trying to please you. Set realistic goals and expectations depending on the child's age and stage of development. If they see that you are anxious and upset, they may lose their confidence and become withdrawn.Avoid comparing your child to others by fostering unconditional love and acceptance. If you child gets a C on a test instead of an A, don't start comparing them to their straight-A sister or brother. Provide encouragement and ask them what they need for support. Instead of focusing only on their performance, allow them to play too. Balance your child's activities with fun and relaxing things that you both can share. If your family has some difficulty with setting time for schoolwork and for having fun, create a schedule for times to play and times to do work. This structure may help to teach your children better time management as well as the importance of breaks.

It is illegal for them to ask if you are pregnant, and also illegal for them to fire you or lay you off due to your pregnancy., Pregnant women need a lot more nutrients than non-pregnant women, which means a bigger proportion of fruits and vegetables. The caffeine intake should not be more than 300 mg (milligrams) a day; some professionals say that you should avoid caffeine as much as you can. Trade your cravings for healthier items. Instead of potato chips, eat carrot sticks. Try chocolate cereal with skim milk instead of chocolate candy. Drink non caffeine drinks, such as Fanta, 7up, or juice.

It needs to be long, to accommodate the dog's body. The longer, the better as it will provide all the pieces you need.  If the sock proves to be too short, you will need to use scrap materials for the ears, tail and legs. It's not a problem if you'd rather use different materials anyway.; , Cut off the toe end., This will leave you with two pieces to form the dog's ears. Put to one side., Just a little over halfway down the length of the sock (the part that doesn't form the toe end), cut the sock. This will remove the end and forms the dog's body piece.  When determining how long to make the dog's body, bear in mind that the cut-off section must be sufficient to form the dog's legs and tail pieces (see next). This is why a long sock is essential.  ,  Cut a piece straight across that measures about 2 inches (5cm). This forms the tail piece. Cut into a tapered piece with a wide base and a thin tip, just as a dog's tail looks. Cut the remaining piece into four equally sized squares. These will form the leg pieces.  , This closes off the front end of the dog, its head., Fill with your filling of choice, such as craft supply fill or homemade fill made from scraps, pantyhose, etc., As you stitch, follow the taper of the tail so that it is larger one end and has a small tip at the other end. Leave a small section open for stuffing. Stuff it with filling, then stitch together.  When stuffing the tail, use a needle to help push the filling right up into the tip. The filling will help the tail to stand upright when attached to the dog.  , Sew the square pieces together, making them as rounded as you can for the legs. Leave a small portion and fill with stuffing then sew together.  As you stuff the legs, pull them into roughly the same shape each and use the filling to round out the leg shape.  , Place the tail at the end of the dog (what was the open leg end). Have the wide end against the dog's body and the thin tip facing up into the air, forming a convex arc (like a bowl). Stitch in place.  Be sure that the stitches are firm. Pull on the tail to test its resilience and add more stitches if needed.  , Place the four legs evenly around the base of the dog's body and stitch in place., Or, you could use a combination of both. Either is fine., You could either embroider eyes in place, just simple black circles or a large white circle with a small black circle for the pupil.

Underweight women should aim for 28 to 40 pounds, overweight women should aim for 15 to 25 pounds, and obese women should shoot for only 11 to 20 pounds.If you are pregnant with twins or multiples, women at healthy weights should gain 37 to 54 pounds, overweight women should gain 31 to 50, and obese women should gain 25 to 42 pounds.Aim to gain only 2 to 4 pounds during the first trimester, and about 1 pound per week thereafter depending on your total weight gain needs.If you are very overweight, your doctor may want you to lose weight during your pregnancy. Losing weight during pregnancy should always be supervised by a doctor. Note, most women should not be losing weight while they are pregnant.; , Taking the time to think through a sample menu for the week will help you incorporate foods with important nutrients for a balanced diet during pregnancy, such as whole grains,lean protein,and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Buying groceries with a weekly meal plan in mind can help reduce the chances you will opt for fast food or load up on unhealthy junk foods.   Avoid fish that is high in mercury such as swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and shark.Restaurant and fast food versions may contain significantly more calories than their homemade counterparts, so ask for low-calorie menu options if available when eating out.Alternately, by preparing foods yourself you can cut out the extra fat, salt, and sugar that many pre-packaged and restaurant foods contain. This will allow you to eat a greater quantity of nutritious food and help save calories and fat that can add unnecessary and unhealthy baby weight.  , It is not clear why pregnancy cravings happen. Some people think cravings may be your body asking for nutrients that it needs.Your pregnancy cravings are normal, and you can learn the best way to satisfy them.   If you simply can’t resist a calling for chocolate cake, ice cream, cheese fries, or another unhealthy food, have a small serving size to satisfy your craving without mindlessly consuming the entire serving.By measuring out a small portion and putting the rest out of sight, you can reduce the chances of reaching for a second helping. Often, a few small and mindful bites can be just as satisfying as an entire serving, without the eventual guilt or weight gain.  , Eating for two does not mean you need to eat twice as much food. You do not need to eat extra calories during the first trimester. In the second trimester, you should eat an extra 340 calories per day. In your third trimester, you should eat about 450 more calories per day.. You may need more calories if your are very physically active while you are pregnant.   Make sure your extra calories come from healthy foods to avoid empty calories and unhealthy amounts of fat, sugar, and salt. Similarly, keep your diet balanced by avoiding a focus on any single food group. Get your calories from a variety of healthy sources such as whole grains, lean protein, fruits, and vegetables. If you constantly feel hungry, choose foods that are bulky and filling but low in calories, such as popcorn, rice cakes, raw vegetables, salads, soups, yogurt, oatmeal, and fresh fruits. Being able to eat a large quantity of a healthy and low-calorie food may help satisfy your urge to eat without piling on extra pounds. Eating protein also helps with this problem because it is slower to digest so it keeps you feeling full longer. Simple carbs get digested the quickest so will leave you feeling hungry sooner. Sample foods to add 100 calories are a spoonful of peanut butter on fresh celery sticks, a cup of non-fat yogurt with a drizzle of honey, a 1/2 cup of sweet corn with seasonings and a small smear of butter, or 10 tortilla chips. Examples of snacks and meals of approximately 300 calories include a scrambled egg with buttered toast and fresh strawberries, a turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes plus 1 cup of vegetable soup, or a bowl of low-fat granola with 1/2 cup skim milk and a handful of berries.  , Eating small meals throughout the day helps with pregnancy related heartburn, nausea, and indigestion. As your baby grows, you will have less space for big meals as well. Eating smaller meals throughout the day will help you meet your nutritional needs.   Plan on eating about 5 or 6 times per day, spreading your calorie consumption over several small meals and a few healthy snacks.Eating every 2 to 3 hours can help keep you energized and keeps your metabolism active and your blood sugar stable, which will keep you from overindulging and may reduce your risk of gestational diabetes. Keep healthy, pre-measured snacks on hand at home and on the go. By making it convenient to grab a healthy snack in appropriate serving sizes, you reduce the likelihood of purchasing fast food or vending machine options or finishing an entire bag of potato chips when you need a snack.  , Water carries nutrients to your baby and can help prevent constipation, hemorrhoids, and excessive swelling, and urinary tract and bladder infections. Your 10 cups of fluid does not have to be water only.Avoid sugary and fatty drinks such as flavored coffees, sports drinks, sodas, and whole milk. Opt instead for skim milk or non-dairy alternatives, decaf coffee you flavor or sweeten yourself, a small glass of 100% fruit juice, plain decaf tea, or water.",981,"['fluids', 'moderation', 'extra calories', 'weekly diet', 'drink plenty', 'cravings', 'pregnancy', 'day', 'water', 'cups', 'target weight gain']"

You won’t have to worry about cramming or stressing about retaining information at the last moment. Sophomore year is a good time to start, either by taking an SAT prep. course offered by Abbey Road Programs, your high school, or another organization or by independently studying using an SAT preparation book. You can also take the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT), which can give you a good idea of what to expect on the SAT and where you rank compared to other students nationally.; , So which one should you take? Well that depends on your strengths. The SAT tends to emphasize vocabulary, so if you love words and reading, it’s the way to go. If you tend to do better in math, you may want to look into the ACT, which places less emphasis on vocabulary. That said, be aware that ACT math is more advanced and will test all the way up to trigonometry. The ACT also has a science section – the SAT does not. There are some other key differences, but these details may give you a good idea of which test you’ll be better suited to take.  , First and foremost, know the format and details.   Format: The test contains 3 hours 45 minutes of timed sections, but is likely to last four to four and a half hours including administration time. Sections: The SAT is about composed of three main sections (Critical Reading,Mathematics, and Writing) divided into nine subsections, plus one experimental subsection that will not count toward your overall score (200 to 800 points are possible for each section, for a total possible score of 2400). The subject matter of each subsection will not be presented in order! In other words, you may encounter a math subsection, followed by a reading subsection, followed by another reading subsection, or something different entirely. There’s no way to predict the order in which the sections fall, with the exception of the essay, which will come first. Here’s a breakdown of what to expect for each of the main sections:  Critical Reading: 70 minutes total. Two 25-minute subsections and one 20-minute subsection, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions that test your vocabulary and questions about short and long reading passages that test your reading comprehension. Math: 70 minutes total. One 25-minute multiple choice subsection with 20 questions; another 25-minute subsection containing 8 multiple choice questions and 10 grid-inquestions that require test-takers write their answers inside a grid on the answer sheet. One 20-minute multiple choice section with 16 questions. Writing: 60 minutes total. One 25-minute essay subsection graded on a scale of 1-6; two multiple choice subsections (one lasting 25 minutes, the other 10) that test you on sentence error detection and improving paragraphs. Experimental: 25 minutes total. One of the subjects will have a fourth, unscored subsection, but because College Board wants to get an accurate idea of how well you do on the experimental portion, you will not be able to tell which one it is. It could fall under any of the three main sections and come at any time during the test (except the essay), so try your best on all ten subsections.   Question Difficulty: There are three levels of difficulty for questions: easy, medium and hard. The questions in the first third of each section are easy, those in the second third are medium, and the last third are hard (Reading comprehension questions will not follow this pattern). Scoring: You receive one point for each correct answer in multiple choice sections. One quarter of a point is deducted for each incorrect answer, but there is no penalty for leaving a question blank. This means you should be able to make a very educated guess if you’re having trouble on a multiple choice question. Otherwise, leave it blank. Unlike multiple choice questions, there is no penalty for incorrect answers on grid-in questions because the test-taker is not limited to a few possible choices, so if you’re crunched for time, you can make a guess without it affecting you negatively. These points (including your essay score) will be added up to make a “raw score”, which will later be converted to your individual section scores.  , Studying doesn’t have to be a soul-draining experience. Do be diligent in your studies and test preparation, but make sure you remember to give yourself a break! You should not spend the month before the test locked in your room, pouring over test prep. books and cramming. Schedule time to study, but give yourself breaks, get outside, and have fun, too.  , Make sure you get plenty of sleep the few nights before the test. Don’t cram the night before the test! If you haven’t retained concepts before this point, you’re not likely to absorb them so close to the test. You may want to have a light review of vocabulary and math concepts, but frantically studying probably won’t help you. Eat a balanced breakfast the morning of the test, and make sure you use the restroom before the test begins, or you’ll have to wait for designated break times (you will have three 5-minute breaks during which time you may use the rest room and consume snacks and beverages). Make sure you relax and stay calm during the test. If something goes horribly wrong during the test, you can always cancel your scores. But remember there are only a certain number of tests offered each year, so it’s good to make each time you take the test count.  , Every question on the test is worth the same amount (one point), so spend your time making sure you get the easy and medium questions correct and save hard questions for last. Rushing through the test to get to the hardest questions will likely drag your score down.  ",996,"['universities', 'colleges', 'strategy', 'stress', 'scores', 'options', 'test', 'popular belief']"

If your toe is infected you might see red streaks running up your toe, foot, or leg. You might get a fever of 100.4ºF (38ºC) or higher. Pus – thick, white or colored drainage from the injury – is another sign of infection. See your doctor if any of these signs occur, because infections can be serious.Your doctor will prescribe you antibiotics if an infection is present. Take these as prescribed and until they’re gone.  , See your doctor if your pain is severe enough to interfere with sleep or daily activities, does not improve 2 hours after taking pain medicine, or gets worse over time. If you have swelling that gets worse or does not improve after medicine, ice, and elevating your foot, get help.Ask questions like, ""My toe hurts more today than it did yesterday and Tylenol isn't helping, is that okay?"" or ""How much swelling is normal?""  , Sometimes, a crushing injury to a toenail (like having a heavy object dropped on your toenail) can cause a subungual hematoma – bleeding underneath the nail. This creates a little pocket of blood under the nail, which can be uncomfortable because of the pressure. It looks like a dark blue, black, or purple bruise like splotch beneath your nail. If the bruise is less than ¼ the size of the nail, it will probably resolve on its own. Otherwise, see your doctor because you may need to have the fluid drained from under the nail to prevent further pain and injury.Don’t attempt to do this on your own or for someone else. See a doctor.   Your doctor will drill a very small hole in your toenail to let the blood drain out. This procedure shouldn’t hurt, and draining the blood will make your toe feel better because it relieves the pressure.  , Whether your toenail will regrow normally depends on whether or not the nail bed was damaged. If you’re worried about how your nail might look when it grows back, speak to your doctor about the possibility of a small surgery on your nail bed. If you can see visible damage to your tissue around your nail, like any tears, see your doctor. If the nail bed or nail matrix are very damaged, your nail might not grow back or might look different – but some problems are fixable.   It may take 6-12 months for a toenail to completely regrow., If you spend 15 minute or more trying to scrub your injury clean, and you still see dirt or debris in it, get medical help. It’s really important to thoroughly clean the wound to prevent infection, so if you can’t do it on your own you need someone who can.Depending on how you hurt your toe, you might also need a tetanus shot or tetanus booster. If the cut is dirty and it has been 5 years or more since your last booster, then you will need a tetanus shot. If the cut is clean and it has been more than 10 years since your last tetanus booster, then you will need a tetanus shot., Many injuries that cause nail avulsion can also cause broken bones. Check your injured toe to see if it bends and straightens all the way. If not, or if it’s sticking out at an odd angle, it may be broken.

"['sprinkle baking soda inside', 'stuff the shoes with newspaper', 'try kitty litter', 'try coffee grounds', 'rub with white vinegar', 'swab with rubbing alcohol', 'use dryer sheets', 'freeze your shoes']",How to Deodorize Shoes1," This classic fix is famous for a reason — it works. Sprinkling about a tablespoon of baking soda inside a smelly pair of shoes will help absorb the odor and draw out moisture that makes it easier for bacteria to thrive. For best results, add the baking soda when you take the shoes off at night and shake it out before you put them on in the morning.   You may want to avoid this for leather shoes — the baking soda can dry them out.; , Instead of tossing yesterday's newspaper in the trash, recycle it with this odor-removal trick. Pack smelly shoes with bunched-up newspaper, then leave them in a dry spot to sit for several days. The newspaper will gradually absorb the odor and moisture from inside the shoes, leaving them fresh and new.   You can also try sprinkling the newspaper with your favorite sweet-smelling perfume or aromatic. A few drops of vanilla extract can work especially well., While it may not seem like the first thing you'd want in your shoes, kitty litter is designed specifically to neutralize odors, so it's actually a great choice. Spreading a tablespoon or two of (clean) kitty litter inside each shoe before you go to bed should greatly cut down on odor. Don't forget to shake your shoes into the trash in the morning!  , If you're a coffee addict, make use of the leftover grounds you produce every day to fight shoe odor. Sprinkling a handful of dry grounds inside each shoe and letting them sit for a few hours is an excellent way to eliminate bad smells. Using dry grounds is crucial here — wet grounds will leave your shoes damp (which can make them smell worse before they dry out) and can stain the fabric of lighter-colored shoes.   Coffee grounds also work well as a general-purpose odor remover. Try setting an uncovered bowl of dry grounds in the fridge. The results should be similar to what you'd get with baking soda., Swabbing the inside of each shoe with a rag or paper towel dampened with white vinegar is a great way to remove foot odors. Let the shoes dry completely before wearing them again — otherwise, you'll just replace the odor with the smell of vinegar. Stuff with crumpled up newspaper to help remove excess moisture if you use too much vinegar.   Alternatively, try using vinegar along with the baking soda method above to create a fizzing foam that fills the shoe and removes odors.Stick to white vinegar here. Other varieties, like apple cider vinegar and balsamic, can stain your shoes.  , Alcohol is a powerful disinfectant — it's great at killing a wide range of bacteria and other microorganisms.This makes it perfect for removing odor-causing bacteria from a pair of shoes. Soak a cotton swab or Q-tip in rubbing alcohol (also called isopropyl alcohol) and scrub the insides of your shoes. Be thorough, hitting every corner of the inside fabric and re-soaking your swab as needed.  , These disposable laundry accessories are a cheap, convenient way to fight foot odor. Stuff one sheet in each shoe at the end of the day to remove odors overnight. For best results, be sure to use scented dryer sheets — unscented ones may absorb some of the bad odor, but they won't leave your shoes smelling as fresh.  , According to some cleaning resources, this odd trick will leave your shoes smelling fresh once they come to room temperature.Leaving your shoes in the freezer overnight allegedly kills the bacteria that cause shoes to smell bad.   Note, however, that some sources dispute this method.You may want to pair it with one of the other tricks above to be safe if you need good-smelling shoes.

"['pick a preschool style', 'start a year in advance', 'go in for an interview', 'appeal when necessary']",How to Get Your Child Into a Good School1," Preschools come in many forms, from daycare style to academically-rigorous. Consider what type of environment would help your child flourish and look for schools that best fit your child’s learning style.Take a look at the educational philosophies. Does the school believe in learning by play or studying? When do they introduce reading and math? Does the school follow a particular model such as the Montessori Method or the Waldorf approach? Pay attention to the school’s atmosphere. Do the children seem happy? Are the classrooms and teachers inviting and do they foster a positive learning environment in which your child or children will flourish? Consider your own child’s learning needs. Think about what your child needs in addition to what you want for your child. Will they be comfortable in big classes or a smaller environment? Can they focus in a group or do they need one-on-one time? Many preschools will allow a prospective child to spend half a day in their programs to see if it is a good fit. It is important to provide this preliminary exposure to the child and ask them how they felt about their experiences. Often times what we see from the outside may not be what is truly experienced by the child interacting within that environment. Enquire About the Safety Procedure. Kids are born mischievous; they like to play around and do adventurous things. They must get an environment where they can explore themselves without the fear of getting hurt. Thus, parents must ask the school staff about the safety and security procedures adopted for the kids.; , Every preschool is different, but often schools fill up fast. Contact preschools that you think would work for your child about a year before you plan to enroll them. This gives you more time to plan financially and make sure you receive a spot.Ask the school, “What are the requirements for admitting a child into your school?” Admissions processes vary greatly, so asking directly often gets you the best information. If you are looking at a preschool that is part of an elite or prestigious elementary school, consider contacting the school about a year and half before enrollment and prepare for a longer admissions process.  , This is the time when the school gets to know you and your child. Be honest about your family life and your child’s personality. The school is there to help your child bolster their strengths and improve their weaknesses, so it's important to let the school know what those are.Focus less on proving your child’s intelligence and more on letting their personality shine through. Many schools are interested in the interpersonal fit more than the academic fit at this age. Ask thoughtful questions based on your conversation. This lets the school know that you are interested and engaged in the admissions process. Try a question like, ""My child enjoys creative activities and spaces. What sort of programs do you offer that will help nurture their creative side?"" It may be helpful to write a list of questions you may have prior to the interview. There’s no need for a resume or portfolio at this age. While this is a trend among some parents at some elite schools, admissions officers generally agree it does nothing for the admissions process.  , Getting on the waitlist isn’t generally too much of a problem. If your first choice school wait lists your child, though, you can always appeal to the directors to reconsider. Do not admonish them for not accepting your child. Rather, provide sincere information as to why your child would be best served in their school.Appeal directly to the director. They are the school’s gatekeeper and have more sway than anyone. Let the director know what your child will get at their school that they cannot find somewhere else, and why it is important for your child to be a part of this community. Tell them directly, ""I believe this school is the best option for my child because of the programs and resources it has to offer. I see my child learning and performing better in this school than in any other, and I would like to ask you to reconsider their waitlist position."" Do not expect that this will automatically change anything. The director is unlikely to bump an existing student when you are on the waitlist. You must still be patient. It is okay to ask them why they chose not to accept your child. Sometimes the answers they provide you will help you to possibly place your child at an alternate school of choice, or for reapplying to the same school when appropriate. It also shows your interest and initiative to learn more about their decision making process and may even change their mind to accept your child.

"['relax and take some time alone', 'self-soothe', 're-frame the situation', 'let out frustration']",How to Get Over a Friend's Betrayal2," Meditate, shop or dance. Do something that you enjoy to take your mind off of everything. Do whatever you have to do to make yourself feel better. You are more likely to find a worthwhile solution while doing something you enjoy or having fun. It sounds counter-intuitive, but creative solutions often come out of doing something fun even if is not related to the task at hand.   Relating back to the example above, you should remove yourself from the situation. You don't want to be around people who know your secret. Retreat. Remove yourself from the situation. Go do something relaxing.  , Avoid self-blame. Don’t assume that everything is all your fault and you always mess things up. Try not over generalize with statements like, “This always happens to me.” Over generalizing leads to depression.Everyone makes mistakes and has accidents. “Bad things” happen to everyone. Blaming yourself for everything that has occurred paralyzes you from moving forward, which makes it harder for you to let go and move on with your healing.If we continue with the previous example, don't beat yourself up for telling your ""big mouth"" friend your secret. Instead of thinking, ""I'm so stupid. Why did I do that?"" Think, ""Well, I made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes.""  , If you believe that your friend has betrayed you, and you have not received an apology, re-frame the incident so that the blame is not placed on you. It’s imperative that you manage your own feelings about the situation in a way that is healthy for you so that you can move forward. Re-framing also helps you work toward forgiveness.For instance, instead of thinking that it's all your fault, think about how you now realize that your friend talks a lot and can't keep secrets. Although you know that now, you didn't know it at the time when you shared your secret. You made the best decision that you could at the time. If you could choose again, you would do it differently.  , For many people, the best way to let out frustration is to vent. So, choose a person who you trust that does not mind listening to you talk about the betrayal. You may want to choose a person who is far removed from the situation to avoid bias or any further conflicts among friends. Vetting helps you release your negative emotions about the situation.Try not to be too emotional or too negatively entangled in what happened. For you are stuck in avoidance or self-blame, you won’t be able to express yourself adequately. Choose a person who is not likely to “have a pity party” with you. You don’t want your confidante to become sad and hopeless after hearing your story especially if you already feel that way. Choose a person who will remain positive and might be able to offer you good suggestions about what to do. If you’re not the kind of person who wants to vent to others, then there are other ways of getting out your frustration especially if you’re active person, or even if you’re not. Go on a walk or a run to release some of those negative emotions. If you play a sport, play with friends or kick a ball around. Boxing, kickboxing and even yoga all can be helpful ways to get your stress out of your body.Talk to another friend about your feelings of betrayal. If you don't have a friend or family member to talk to, then journal about it.  ",584,"['frustration', 'situation', 'time']"

This is all in anticipation of the Birth of the Messiah.,, You could read it once on Christmas Eve, by yourself or aloud to your family, once a week in December, or every day in December! Do whatever makes it feel right for you.  , Try to go to church on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. If you have the time and ability, go both days! However, don't limit yourself to those days. Everyone's extra busy in December but try to make room at least twice more than usual to go to church. If you have children or are a child or teen yourself, also see if your church is doing a Christmas pageant!  , In the evenings, pray. If you're feeling stressed about gift buying or if the house will look perfect or if the food will be done on time, just take a few minutes. Breath, pray, and go back to what you were doing with a clear head.  , Set it up wherever you like. On the mantel is popular, because it's a very prominent place. You can set it up all at once, or you can add everyone but baby Jesus, and only add him on Christmas Eve.

Resolving your issue may be as simple as having a conversation with your boyfriend about your expectations.Tell your boyfriend how you feel without accusing him of anything or making fun of his behavior to make sure he’ll be receptive to what you have to say. Be clear about how you’d like him to act and be open to hearing his opinions about it. Try saying something like, “I would feel better if you were more willing to show me affection around your friends,” or “I wish you would pay more attention to me during the school day.”; , If your boyfriend does something that makes you feel like he doesn’t care, take some time to discuss it with him. Your boyfriend may have hurt you unintentionally, but he won’t learn what hurts you if he isn’t aware of his mistakes.If your boyfriend does or says something that hurts you, it may not be appropriate to sit down and discuss it right away, but don’t let it go. When you have a chance to sit down and talk to your boyfriend about what he did that hurt you, try to speak to him calmly about it. Use “I” statements like, “I feel like you don’t care when you say things like that,” instead of accusing him of anything to avoid an argument.  , Some guys have trouble opening up about their feelings, and that can make it difficult for them to act in an affectionate or romantic way. You can help make your boyfriend feel more comfortable by asking him questions about his feelings to help him open up slowly. Ask your boyfriend how he feels about you, and listen to what he has to say. Once he gets accustomed to answering questions about how he feels, he may eventually be able to volunteer the information without you asking. Ask direct questions to make it easier for him to answer. Try asking things like, “how do you feel about me?” or “what’s the most important part of our relationship to you?” Pay attention to how you respond when he opens up. Acting critical of his feelings may make him less apt to answer your questions again. Support him by thanking him for answering you and telling him it means a lot that he tries.  , If you feel uncomfortable discussing things with your boyfriend in person, you may want to write him a letter that explains your concerns and how you feel about him. What’s important is that your boyfriend understands that you’re unhappy and what he can do to fix it.Try not to use aggressive or mean language in your letter as it may make him feel defensive. Your boyfriend may want to speak to you in person after reading the letter. Remember to stay calm and discuss your feelings without getting angry.  Getting angry is perfectly natural, but people tend to become more closed minded in arguments. Avoiding an argument can help to ensure your boyfriend really listens to what you have to say.

For some, the change happens when both partners in a marriage are still alive and want to spend time together in a different place.  For others, the death of a spouse prompts the decision to move.  When you decide that the time has come to look for new housing in retirement, consider not only your budget, but also your lifestyle, the proximity to your family and the status of your health.,  If you are in good health, you can choose to live independently.  However, you must accept that changes in your health are an unavoidable part of aging.  Your health status can change gradually, or you may experience a sudden decline in health.  If you have enough money, you can stay in your home and arrange for professional caretakers to help you.  If not, you may have to arrange to either live with a family member or move to a facility where you will be cared for.,  Retirees have many different kinds of housing options.  Each has its own advantages and shortcomings.  Choose your living arrangement based on your needs, lifestyle and family circumstances.Staying in your family home is one option to consider.  If it’s not too big for you to manage, it might be the best place for you because you are already connected to the community.  To make this work, you may need to make plans to get help with home maintenance.  Also, down the road you may need to arrange for home health care.  If you stay in your home and have significant equity in that home, you may be able to get a reverse mortgage. This loan pays you for the equity in the home. It is only available to those over the age of 62.Moving to a townhouse or condominium community is an option if you don’t want to have to worry about property maintenance.  You can choose a mixed-age location or a 55-and-older community, depending on your preferences.   Retirement communities are independent living quarters where you are provided with amenities such as chef-prepared dining, inside and outside property maintenance and a 24-hour nursing staff.   ,  When you were younger, you may have dreamed of retiring in a tropical paradise.  However, actually doing this may isolate you from people you really need in retirement.  Think about the effect of detaching from your community connections and family ties on a permanent basis.  This is an even bigger consideration if you are single.  If you can afford it, consider purchasing a vacation home where you can live for part of the year.  This way, you can have the best of both worlds. ,  Where you end up in retirement will depend largely on your net worth and your monthly income.  Retirement communities, townhouses and vacation homes are expensive.  So are in-home personal care and skilled nursing services.  If you haven’t already done so, create a monthly budget.  Begin to plan for the long-term and think about how you are going to support yourself physically and financially as you age.  Enlist the help of you children and other family members in making these decisions.",557,"['consequences', 'remote locale', 'living arrangement', 'budget', 'health', 'right time']"
"['use a hands-free leash', 'select the right leash', 'run with your dog', 'walk with your dog', 'pull backwards on the leash to stop', 'practice ignoring distractions']",How to Hold a Dog's Leash3," A hands-free leash is a leash that has a belt, instead of a loop, at the end. You wear the belt around your waist with your dog’s leash attached to the belt. In general the process for walking your dog is the same.There are two great benefits for using a hands-free leash. One is the obvious, you’re hands are free. This makes it easier to reward your dog for good behaviour, and swing your arms if you’re walking quickly or running. Two is that the main point of resistance to your dog is the middle of your body, right near your centre of gravity. This makes you significantly more stable than holding the leash in your hands.  , When you go to the pet store to buy a leash, you’ll notice they come in every material, length and colour you can imagine. The colour you choose is completely up to you! The length should be based on the type of activity you’ll be performing with your dog. And the material should be based on personal comfort and expense.If you’re taking your dog for a loose leash walk, a leash that has the ability to uncoil and recoil is very useful. Instead of folding pieces of the leash in your hands, you can simply click a button and allow your dog to uncoil the rope. These leashes, however, are not designed for heel walks, or walks where there are a lot of obstacles for a rope to get caught on (including people and other dogs). Leashes can be made of metal chains, leather or nylon. Here are some things you may want to consider when choose the material of a leash:  Metal - looks cool, but is heavy. Can prevent a dog from attempting to bite the leash. Leather - expensive, but easy to hold and use. The leather may not be as flexible in cold weather. Nylon - the least expensive, and has the most variety. Stands up after constant exposure to different weather conditions. But can be hard on the hands.    , Many dog owners enjoy bringing their dogs when going for a run, a bike ride, or rollerblading. This offers great exercise to both you and your dog, and should hopefully tire your dog out faster!Remember to control your dog throughout the run. Since it is a run, don’t allow your dog to stop unless you do. You both should be able to maintain the same, steady pace.  , Your dog should have more slack on the leash while walking, than while standing still. They should always feel comfortable in their leash and collar to avoid injury and misbehaviour. When walking, your dog should be immediately to your side (which side will depend on what’s more comfortable to you). Your dog should not walk behind or in front of you.If you allow your dog to walk behind you on a leash, there’s a great chance you’ll pull too hard on the leash in order to force the dog to keep up with you.  , Your right hand should be holding the end of the leash, with your thumb through the loop and excess leash folded in your hand. Your left hand should be holding another section of the leash, closer to your dog. Your left hand should be down near your left thigh. When it’s time to stop, simply pull backwards with your left hand.There should be some slack in the leash between your two hands AND between your left hand and your dog. When you’re ready to move again, start walking forward. Your left arm will naturally pull on the leash and signal your dog it’s time to go. Don’t yank on the leash.  , One of the worst situations most owners encounter when taking their dog for a walk is what happens when another person or another dog walk by. You dog may walk perfectly if there’s no one around, but the moment there’s a distraction, your dog may completely forget everything they've learned. That’s why it’s important to train your dog to ignore distractions while on a walk.When practicing, use a friend or family member as the distraction, rather than practicing on unsuspecting strangers. While learning to ignore distractions, you may find the use of a head halter beneficial. A head halter has a nylon strap that goes around your dog’s snout. And the leash connects to the halter under your dog’s chin. Both of these added features provide you with more control of what your dog is looking at. Teaching your dog to ignore a distraction has a lot to do with making your dog pay attention to you, and only you.There are several methods you can teach your dog:Avoidance - Sometimes the problem isn’t your dog, but maybe the dog coming in the opposite direction. Instead of walking past the oncoming dog, train your dog to reverse directions. The L Pattern - The L pattern method can be used to position your dog off to the side of the path you’re on, facing away from the path. If you see something distracting coming towards you, turn your dog to the left or right. Walk your dog just off the path and use the sit command. Keep your dog sitting there - looking at you - until the distraction has gone by. Repeated Sits - When you see a distraction coming towards, regardless of whether they’ll pass on your left or right side, repeated sit trains your dog to sit and face you. Your dog remains sitting until the distraction has passed. Depending on the situation, you can train your dog to sit facing away from the oncoming distraction, or facing the distraction with their head tilted away, looking at you. Speed Up - Most methods require that you stop your dog while the distraction is near, and wait to resume your walk after the distraction has passed. An alternative is to simply pick up the pace when the distraction approaches, and slow down again after the distraction passes.

"['evaluate stock photo services', 'read the available license agreements carefully', 'choose a rights-managed license', 'quantify your use']",How to Gain Ownership of Your Self Published Book Cover2," There are numerous professional stock photo companies online that allow you to peruse their catalogues and purchase rights to stock photos created by professional photographers.The first thing you need to look at is how to purchase images from the company. Some stock photo companies allow you to purchase a license for a single image, while others require you to become a member or buy a package that includes the potential usage of multiple images. If you decide you want to use a stock photo for your self-published book cover, check the usage restrictions on each stock photo service to make sure the service allows use of photos for self-published books. Some companies restrict usage based on the genre of book you've written. Specifically, some stock photo services don't allow their images to be used for erotic novels. Check out some of the photos available and find several that might meet your needs. Exclusive rights may not be an option for some of them.  , Stock photo services typically offer several different levels of licensing agreements so you can find one that meets your needs and your budget. You may be able to find something that falls short of complete ownership but still accomplishes your goals.Keep in mind that different levels of exclusivity also vary in price. Even though you want ownership of your cover, an exclusive license may not be in your budget – meaning you'd have to settle for less than complete ownership or pursue another method of getting a design for your cover. Royalty free images are among the most common licenses granted by stock photo companies, and give you the right to unlimited use of the image. However, this license is not exclusive (meaning others also could use it), and you have no ownership rights in the image itself. If you're looking for ownership of your self-published book cover, you probably don't want to go with a royalty-free license, even though you can get one relatively cheaply. The photo is only part of the cover. You still have some design work to do in terms of placing the title, your name, and any other material on the front and back covers.  , While a rights-managed license doesn't give you complete ownership of your self-published book cover, it does grant you the exclusive right to use the image as long as the book is sold.With a rights-managed license, you have the exclusive right to use the image, which may be as good as ownership in terms of not having to worry about any other self-published book having the same image on its cover. However, rights-managed licenses also tend to be expensive – maybe even prohibitively so, depending on your budget. Keep in mind that not even large corporations buy rights-managed licenses as a general rule due to their cost.  , One of the trickiest parts of purchasing a rights-managed license for a self-published book cover is determining how long you need exclusive rights to the image. Other terms such as geographic area of use also will potentially affect the cost of the license.The license you buy typically is tailored to your specific use. In some instances, this may mean that your rights are only exclusive in regard to book covers – meaning no one else can use the image for their book cover – but the image remains free for others to license and use in other fields. If you're self publishing, you may have difficulty being able to pin down the exact territory of your use or the length of time you want your license to last. If you're using a print-on-demand service, you'll have even more difficulty if the exclusivity of the license depends on the number of copies you've distributed. For example, if you get a rights-managed license for 100,000 copies of your book, and you sell 100,001 copies, you wouldn't have the right to use the image on that last copy. However, if you only intend to sell a particular number of copies of your book, or sell it only for a limited period of time, these issues may not be a problem.

However, more generally, the term carbon steel is useful to distinguish non-stainless from stainless blades. A genuine ancient or functional Japanese blade would not be stainless, however. If it is stainless, it is almost certainly a modern reproduction designed to only be placed on a wall - it will have little value and will not hold an edge well, if at all.  , If the blade has been properly maintained or is recently created for use (some genuine modern blades do exist) then ensure the blade is sharper than any kitchen knife you've ever known. Be careful of cutting yourself!  ,,, This is called a fuller in Western blade parlance, and it is generally accepted that it is used to lighten the blade, and make it more flexible, while not weakening it. Some other schools of thought suggest it exists so you could pull the sword out someones muscle and tissue which normally creates suction holding the blade in someones body (in which case it is referred to as a 'Blood Groove'). Rarely it may have been be used to cut out an impurity in the metal.  , The back of the blade and the adjacent sides should be shiny (there are katas which you use your katana to make sure no one is behind you by using the mirror-like surface of the sword), but the center and edge may be more matte (but still reasonably polished) and should have a wood-like 'grain' or water-like pattern (think ripples or waves). These patterns are unique to each blade (if genuine and not etched) and are a major part of a particular blade's beauty and personality. In ancient blades the pattern forms as a result of the layering and forging process, but in modern blades it may be 'fake' and a result of acid etching.  , Gendo for blades made from 1877-1945). As a rule of thumb the older it is the better quality it is likely to be, although the work of individual smiths is a major factor in this (ie. an ancient blade by a minor smith may not be the equal of a more recent blade by a famous master).

On average these more recent blades would be worthwhile for training or souvenir purposes, but less so as a collectible.  , If investing serious money then before you do so, get a good book on valuing antique Japanese blades, look at as many as you can to get a sense of them (go to a museum), or (best of all) have the item assessed by a professional.

However, while your guinea pig might enjoy fruit, you should only use it as a snack or a treat. As a result, you don’t need to buy nearly as much fruit as vegetables. And for many people, fruit you have around the house already may be used. When shopping for fresh fruit, consider:   Apples. Blueberries Oranges. Pears. Peaches.; , Unlike fruit, you can feed your guinea pig large amounts of vegetables every week. When buying vegetables, consider:   Carrots. Green peppers. Radish tops. Cucumbers. Brussel sprouts., Pelleted foods are a mix of hay, vitamins, and other food sources that serve as a staple in your guinea pig’s diet. They are much healthier for your guinea pigs than other types of food because they are not dyed with artificial colors and flavors.   Focus only on corn-free and seed-free pellets. Pellets enriched with vitamins are okay., While your guinea pig will be getting some hay in his or her pellets, fresh hay is an important element of a guinea pig’s diet and overall health. This is because guinea pigs need hay in order to keep their teeth from overgrowing. In addition, hay keeps their digestive system clean.   Be aware that a lot of hay sold at large chain stores is not high quality hay. Try to buy fresh hay at pet stores or at farm supply stores. Timothy hay is perfect for adult guinea pigs, Baby and pregnant guinea pigs will need alfalfa hay, which has a higher vitamin and mineral content in it., At the start of every day, you should put out fresh vegetables for your guinea pig. And since vegetables are an important part of your guinea pig’s diet, you need to make sure that he or she has plenty of vegetables throughout the day.   Feed your guinea pig about one cup of vegetables for every two pounds he or she weighs. Break your vegetable servings up into at least two. This way, your guinea pig will have fresh and unwilted vegetables throughout the day. Whenever you provide new vegetables, remove any old, uneaten, or spoiled vegetables from the previous serving., While fruit is important and can provide your guinea pig with badly needed vitamins, you need to limit his or her consumption of it. Fruit should be served to your guinea pig as a treat, not as a main course.   Limit fruit treats to once or twice a week. Try to only feed your guinea pig one or two tablespoons of fruit for every two pounds that your guinea pig weighs. Only provide fresh and washed fruit to your guinea pig., Providing fresh hay throughout the day and week is extremely important for your guinea pig’s health. Since hay can accumulate bacteria guinea pig waste, you’ll want to remove old hay periodically and replace it with fresh hay.   Don’t be afraid of giving your guinea pig too much hay. More is always better than less. Make sure your hay has not been sitting around the house too long., At around the same time you serve your guinea pig vegetables, you should also serve fresh pellets. This is important as pellets are the foundation of your guinea pig’s diet.   Provide 1/4th to 1/8th cup of pellets per day. Amount fed will vary based on size and age of the guinea pig. Feel free to divide pellets up into 2 or 3 servings if your guinea pig tends to overeat or eat it all at once. Serve the pellets in a ceramic bowl., You also need to make sure that your guinea pig has plenty of fresh water. Fresh water is essential to your guinea pig’s diet and will help with digestion of hay, pellets, and the other food you provide. As a result, monitor water closely.   Consider using a plastic drip bottle. Provide a water bowl, too. Check your guinea pig’s water at least once a day. Change and clean your guinea pig’s water bowel and drip bottle a couple times a week.  , Guinea pigs of different ages have different dietary needs. As a result, when thinking about and formulating a well-balanced diet for your guinea pig, you need to think about their age.   If you adopted your guinea pig as a baby, then you should have an accurate idea of his or her age. If you don’t know your guinea pig’s age, consult a veterinarian or someone with specialized knowledge. When establishing your guinea pig’s age, you don’t need to be exact. Just be able to classify your guinea pig in one of several stages of life, including: baby, youth, adult, or senior., Depending on sex, your guinea pig’s dietary needs will vary. Sex is also important when determining your guinea pig’s age. While for the most part, male and female guinea pigs require the same nutrition, there are a couple things you should consider.   If your guinea pig is pregnant, you’ll need to alter her food mix. If you are trying to breed your guinea pig, you should probably alter the breeding pig’s diets to increase their vitamin intake., Your guinea pig might have special, individual, needs that will impact his or her dietary needs. As a result, you need to consider any special or unique factors that could influence your guinea pig’s health or diet.   Does your guinea pig have any chronic medical problems? Does your guinea pig have any disorders or other unique factors that might impact his or her dietary needs.",918,"['pellets', 'sex', 'fruit', 'water bowl', 'pelleted food', 'fresh fruit', 'treat', 'hay', 'fresh hay', 'guinea pig', 'special needs', 'plenty', 'age', 'bag', 'fresh vegetables']"

This is called an amniotomy. This will likely only be done if your cervix is dilating and the baby is in your pelvis in the birthing position. The doctor will put a probe inside you that has a hook on the end, sort of like a crochet needle. The hook will be used to puncture the amniotic sac. You will likely feel the water flow out when it breaks.This procedure may be uncomfortable but it will not harm you or the baby. The hospital may monitor the baby’s heart rate throughout the procedure.; , Women’s experiences when their water breaks are highly variable. Some women experience an obvious flood of fluid while other women have difficulty identifying it. If you are unsure, call your doctor or midwife. When your water breaks you may feel:Wetness in your vagina and underwear that is different from your normal pregnancy discharge. A small amount of fluid that starts and stops. It may be difficult to distinguish this from a trickle of urine. A continuous, but small flow. A sudden and unmistakable amount of water.  , Scientific studies suggest that commonly suggested methods of trying to start labor are generally ineffective. These include:Acupuncture Homeopathy Caster oil Enemas Hot baths with ginger oil. This has not been shown to shorten labor. Do not take ginger orally because it may increase your risk of bleeding. Sex. Having sex won’t cause any problems for you or the baby if you have it before your water breaks. Afterwards you should not have sex because it may increase the risk of infection.  , Generally you will only be induced if there is a reason why it is likely to be better for you and the baby. Reasons for induction include:You are in your 42nd week of gestation and labor isn’t starting. You have an infection in your uterus. The baby isn’t developing sufficiently. There isn’t enough amniotic fluid in the sac. The placenta is separating from the wall of the uterus and / or starting to break down. You have diabetes or high blood pressure.  , Some women want to schedule the birth ahead of time and then be induced. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) is not against elective induction but they do try to discourage across the board induction of everyone. Patients must be at least 39 weeks before induction will be considered. Risks include:If your cervix is not dilated enough, you will need a C-section. Manually rupturing the amniotic sac increases your infection risk. Inducing labor makes it more probable that the umbilical cord will slip into the vagina before the baby. If this happens as the baby passes through the baby will press on the umbilical cord and cut off its oxygen supply during the birth. This is very dangerous for the baby.  , There are situations when a C-section, instead of a natural birth is necessary. Under these circumstances, induction is unsafe for you and the baby:The position of the placenta or baby makes a natural birth dangerous. This includes if the placenta is blocking your cervix or if the baby is not in the correct position. For example, if the baby is crosswise in the transverse fetal position you cannot be induced. There are concerns about whether you can physically give birth. This includes if your birth canal may be too small for the baby to fit through or if your uterus has been weakened by a prior surgery or C-section that makes it likely to rupture. Active infections, such as herpes or HIV, may also make a C-section safer.  ",612,"['water breaks', 'option', 'induction', 'doctor', 'labor', 'optional induction', 'water']"
"['keep your chihuahua close', 'feed your dog', 'groom and pet your dog', 'train your dog', 'play with your chihuahua']",How to Bond with a Chihuahua1," Chihuahua’s are extremely territorial of their owners and love being around them. They like nothing more than to snuggle up in your lap and nap. Indulge your pets desire to snuggle and keep your Chihuahua close. This will only intensify your dog’s already strong bond.Consider carrying your Chihuahua in a carrier designed for small dogs. Hold your Chihuahua in your lap and pet it while you watch TV.; , One of the easiest ways to establish a bond with any dog is by feeding it. Establishing routine feeding times will help keep your Chihuahua’s anxiety levels down, helping it feel more comfortable with you. Feeding your dog also creates a positive association between you and your Chihuahua’s food.Avoid leaving the food in the bowl all day. Instead, give the dog its food at mealtime. You want your dog’s positive association with feedings to be with you and not the bowl. Because Chihuahuas can develop such intense bonds with one person, make sure that you are the one feeding the dog. If someone else is feeding it, your Chihuahua may end up bonding with them. Giving your dog a treat every now and then will also strengthen its affection towards you.  , Regularly petting and grooming your Chihuahua causes its body to release hormones that make it less anxious. This will also strengthen its bond with you. Stroke your dog’s fur while it sits in your lap. If you have a longhaired Chihuahua, give its coat a regular brushing. The more that you touch your Chihuahua, the closer its bond with you will be.Washing your Chihuahua and clipping its nails will also help strengthen your bond. Because they tend to only bond with one person, you should groom your dog and avoid hiring someone else to do it. Your Chihuahua may react negatively to someone else.  , Training is a great way to build a bond between you and your Chihuahua. You will spend more time together. You will also give it encouragement and the occasional treat. All of these things will build a sense of teamwork and strengthen the bond between you and your dog.Rewarding your dog with treats will reinforce good behavior and create a positive association between you and treats. Maintain an even and warm tone during training. Getting frustrated and yelling at your dog will frighten your Chihuahua and make it anxious around you. Chihuahuas can be difficult to train. You may want to work with a trainer. However, you will need to be present and conduct much of the training to ensure that your dog bonds with you., In general, playing with your dog is one of the best ways to build a strong bond between an owner and their pet. You can play fetch, hide-and-seek, tug-of-war and other games with your dog. As you do more things that it enjoys, your Chihuahua will develop a positive association between you and having fun.Try to avoid roughhousing with your Chihuahua. They are delicate dogs that can be easily injured. If you take your Chihuahua on a walk, only go a short distance. Chihuahuas exert their energy in short bursts and do not have the stamina for long walks.  ",531,"['dog', 'chihuahua close', 'pet', 'chihuahua']"
"['learn a little history first', 'to understand how recent the understandings in this field actually are', 'study the next attempts made to understand how chemical bonds occur', 'note that every chemical bond has two orbitals', 'examine the principal chemical bonds']",How to Study the Nature of the Chemical Bond (Chemistry)," The understanding of the nature of the chemical bond is a relatively recent development that dates back only to several decades. Before the understanding of the chemical bond could be achieved, there was a need for the understanding of the nature of atomic structure, which was not completely understood at that time. By the development of quantum mechanics in general, and the Schroedinger equation in particular, the understanding of the atomic nature began to be more understood.   The complete solution of the Schroedinger equation of the hydrogen atom gave a complete description of its electronic energies and also gave a description of the radial and angular wave functions of this atom. This achievement paved the road to the understanding of the structure of more complicated atoms with more than one electron in its structure. The solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom uncovered the existence of the electronic spin which is a very fundamental property to the description of the chemical bond. Also the principle of exclusion by Pauli led to the understanding that no more than two electrons with opposite spin could occupy the same orbital at the same time. The functions of the hydrogen atom, as obtained from the solution of the Schroedinger equation for this atom, were used for a long period of time to describe the orbitals of many electrons atoms by giving the many electrons atom orbital functions that are hydrogen-like wave functions. The solution of the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom gave, as one of its many results, quantum numbers that designate the energy levels of the electronic levels in the atom. This is in addition to describing the various orbitals shape, energy and symmetry by other quantum numbers that are also used for other atoms. These quantum numbers also gave the amount of degeneracy of the orbital levels in the hydrogen atom. For example p orbital in the hydrogen atom is triply degenerate while d orbitals are five degenerate orbitals.; , The next attempts were based on the quantum mechanical data that were obtained for the hydrogen atom. An orbital is a wave function that is obtained by the solution of the radial part of the Schroedinger equation of the hydrogen atom. This orbital describes the movement of the electrons that reside in it. This orbital can accommodate only two electrons with opposite spins of 1/2 and -1/2.   The attempts to explain the bonding nature in the hydrogen molecule were achieved relatively recently, in the early years of the 19th century. The driving force for the formation of the hydrogen molecule and any chemical bond in general can be obtained using the theory of molecular orbitals, which states that chemical bonds between atoms are driven by the favorable formation of a molecular orbital that is lower in energy than both atomic orbitals of the two separate atoms.  , One of them is bonding with positive overlap between the two overlapping orbitals. The other molecular orbital is anti-bonding with a nodal plane between the overlapping orbitals. The two electrons of the chemical bond occupy the bonding orbital which can explain the extra-stability of the formed molecule. Today it is known that only certain number of electrons in an atom can participate in the bonding process of making chemical bonds. These electrons are located in the outer electronic shell of the atom. The inner electrons do not participate in the bonding process.   These electrons that are located in the outer electronic shell of the atom are called the valence electrons and confer the reactivity characteristics of the atom. The octet rule of a closed valence shell was used qualitatively to rationalize why bonds form.  , There are several types of chemical bonds. These are: the covalent bond and the ionic bond, in addition to the dative bond and hydrogen bonding. The following descriptions explain each in turn:   The covalent bond can be fairly explained with the help of the molecular orbitals theory which states that the driving force for the formation of a chemical bond is the formation of a more stable molecule that has molecular orbital that is energetically lower than the atomic orbitals. The ionic bond can be easily understood based on the octet rule in which the two atoms are happy with their closed shell electronic configuration. Ionic bonds are typical for atoms with completely different electro-negativity. This is in contrast to covalent bonds in which the participating atoms in the bond have similar electronegativities. Ionic bonds are an example of an electrostatic interaction between a positive and a negative charge. An example of an ionic bond occurs in the molecule of calcium phosphide. An example of a covalent bond occurs in the hydrogen molecule. Dative bonds are the third type of chemical bonds and are typical of transition metals complexes which occur between a transition metal and ligands that can be neutral with electron lone pair or can bear a negative charge. In this type of bonding the d-orbitals of the metal are involved with sigma donor ligands. The last type of chemical bonds is hydrogen bonding. It occurs mainly between molecules that bear a hydrogen atom that is bonded to an electronegative atom and an electron donor atom such as oxygen. An example of hydrogen bonding occurs in a solution of pure water. Hydrogen bonding makes the liquid that is involved have a high boiling point. Liquids that do not have hydrogen bonding between their molecules are low boiling liquids such as ethers.

To do that, you must have the title. The title is a certificate that you should have received from the dealer, probably after you paid off all the loans.The title will name the rightful owner or owners of the vehicle.   If you have lost your title certificate, you will need to get a replacement from your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Each state has a different procedure and fee for this. At http://www.dmv.org/replacing-a-lost-title.php you can find a handy map of the U.S. with contact information for the DMV in each state.; , A lienholder is someone you borrowed money from, with the car as collateral. If you still owe them money, their name will appear on the title. Before you can give away the car, you must pay off all loans, and the lienholders must sign off on the title certificate that they have been paid., If the owner’s name on the title is someone who is deceased, and the gift is an inheritance, you may need to go to Probate Court to get an order for the transfer. Alternatively, in some states, it is possible to file a simple affidavit with the Registry of Motor Vehicles in order to take possession. You will need to check with your state law.If the car was owned jointly by a married couple, for example, and one dies and the remaining owner wants to give the car away as a gift, the surviving individual can, in most cases, transfer the car alone. A copy of the death certificate may be needed to accompany the title.  , The person giving the vehicle will be required to provide his or her signature, driver's license information and odometer information for the vehicle at the time of the gift. The person receiving the car must fill out the buyer portion of the title. Where the title asks for the sale price, you will fill in “Gift.”   Be careful when completing these steps. Many title certificates specify that the writing must be done cleanly and clearly, with no erasures or cross-outs. Even a simple printing error could require you to obtain a new copy of the title certificate and start over.  , If the lienholders have not yet already given you something to show that the loans are satisfied, you will need to have them sign off on the title as satisfied in full. If your loan was from a dealer, you will want to contact the lending department. If you obtained your loan from a bank or some other lending institution, then find your original loan paperwork. That will tell you who to contact for payoff information.  , In general, gifts between family members are freely allowed, and there would be no sales tax at the time of the transfer.However, each state’s laws are different and you should check with your own state. Some states may require proof of a family relationship for the gift to be tax-free.  , The person receiving the car will ordinarily have to demonstrate that he or she is covered by insurance before taking ownership. This is not exactly a concern for the person giving the gift, but the new owner, in order to drive the car, will have to get it insured and registered. The new owner's insurance company will usually issue the owner a card or letter to show proof of insurance., Some states will require the car to be inspected separately at the time of the transfer. Other states will not. You can check with your state's Department of Motor Vehicles to find out your requirements. In many states, this will require you to take the car to a licensed inspection station and undergo a safety inspection, emissions test, or other similar procedure.  , In most states, the person receiving the gift will have to take the completed documents to the Registry of Motor Vehicles. You will turn in the original title, with all the completed signatures, along with whatever fee may be required.  , This will be up to the new owner of the car. Registration is the procedure in all states that certifies that the car may be licensed and driven in the state. In many states, you can call the Registry ahead of time to make an appointment., As the recipient of a gift vehicle, you will need to receive a new title. The Registry will deliver this in your own name, usually within a couple weeks. When it arrives, check the new Certificate of Title to make sure that the information is all printed accurately. This document is your proof of ownership of the vehicle. If there are any errors, even if they appear minor (such as an incorrect middle initial, for example), these could cause trouble for you in the future. If you see any mistakes, notify the Registry of Motor Vehicles immediately. You will probably have to submit an application for a correction.",844,"['inheritance', 'lienholders', 'ownership', 'usual procedures', 'back', 'state', 'title', 'check inspection requirements', 'insurance', 'new title', 'motor vehicles', 'liens', 'car', 'probate court', 'documents', 'state registry', 'transfer section', 'additional gift requirements']"
"['obtain a bill of sale form', 'fill out the required information', 'add an addendum if you need to include additional information', 'have each party sign the bill of sale', 'give the original bill of sale to the buyer', 'keep a copy for your records']",How to Draft a Bill of Sale for a Vehicle2," In most circumstances, you will be able to fill out a simple bill of sale form instead of drafting one from scratch. State DMVs and transportation departments will usually make forms available that include all of the required information. Talk with the vehicle's seller and determine who will obtain the bill of sale form. If you need to get the form, you can do so in the following ways:   First you can navigate to your state's DMV website and download the form from there. Generally, every state will have a place online where you can find forms. Look for the vehicle bill of sale form. If you do not have consistent access to the internet, you can call your local DMV office and ask them to send the bill of sale form to you. If you are near your DMV, you can visit the office in person and pick up a bill of sale form as well.  , Once you get a copy of your applicable bill of sale form, you will need to fill it out with the seller of the vehicle. Work through the form and fill out everything accurately and completely. Do not leave anything blank unless the form says it is acceptable. While each state form will differ in substance and layout, they will all usually ask for at least the following information:The vehicle's description The names of the buyer and seller The date the transaction took place How much the vehicle was sold for Whether the vehicle transfer was a gift The seller's address and contact information The buyer's address The seller's signature  , If your state has a form, it may not include all of the information you want to include. If this happens, you can usually attach a piece of paper, known as an addendum, to the bill of sale form. Some states may even have certain addendum forms for particular situations. For example, in Vermont, if the vehicle you are buying is nine years old or newer, you and the seller must attach an odometer disclosure statement. This statement asks the seller to certify the vehicle's mileage and it must be signed by you and the seller., After you fill out the bill of sale and all required or discretionary addendums, you and the seller need to sign in the necessary places. Most states only require the seller to sign the bill of sale, but both parties might do it anyway. Additionally, you and/or the seller may have to sign one or more addendums. Make sure you read the form directions carefully so every party signs the in the correct places.  , The bill of sale is not only a document that evidences the sale of a vehicle, it is also an official document that must be submitted to the state. Therefore, you (the buyer) will need to obtain the original bill of sale once it has been filled out. This original document will need to be filed with the DMV when you register the vehicle in your name.  , Before you file the bill of sale, make copies for the seller and yourself. This document is your main piece of evidence proving a transfer took place. You will need it in case there is a dispute between you and the other party.

"['measure your car', 'gather materials', 'assemble the legs', 'add your platform', 'cover the platform', 'assemble the platform', 'outfit your bed']",How to Make a Bed in Your Car3," To determine how large you can make your platform, you will need to measure the area that you intend to put it. Decide if you want your back seats up or down to fit the platform, and measure the length and width of your configuration.Remember that vertical height will be important, too. Generally speaking, you should plan on your platform being eight to ten inches above the base on which it sits.  , The base of your platform should be sheets of ¾ inch (2 cm) or one inch plywood, while the legs will be constructed from two by fours. You will also need wood screws, a drill, a covering such as carpet, and staples. All of these materials can be found at a hardware or home improvement store.Have the plywood sheet cut to fit the dimensions you measured. Cut the large sheet in half widthwise so that your platform can be stored in stackable sections. Have the two by fours cut up so that you end up with 12 pieces. Eight of them should be the height of your intended platform (8 to 10 inches or 20 to 26 cm), while four of them should be about four inches shorter than the width of your plywood sheet.  , You will need four legs, two for each platform. Make the legs by aligning a short section of two by four to either end of a long two by four piece. Make sure the legs are level with the support, then use 4 or 5 inch (10 to 13 cm) wood screws to secure the legs directly to the support.Opt to use at least two screws for each individual foot. Repeat this process until you have four sets of legs completed.  , Once your legs are completed, make your platform by screwing the plywood sheets onto the legs. Each sheet should have two legs, one toward the top and one toward the bottom.Consider the positioning of the legs before you install them. They may need to get around wheels, indents, or other features in your car’s interior. Screw the platform down with at least one screw over each foot, as well as one in the middle of each support.  , Use carpet, fabric, a tarp, or whatever covering you think is appropriate to cover your platform. Staple your cover down along the edges of your platform using carpet tacks or industrial staples.Try to staple the cover to the outer edges of the platform for maximum comfort.  , The platform can be stored in two separate pieces whenever you are not using it. To assemble it, simply unstack the two pieces and set them up so that one sits directly in front of the other in the back of your car.   To help the platform hold together a bit, consider adding a velcro edge where the two pieces of platform attach.  , Once you have your two platforms ready and in position, decide how you want to outfit your bed. You may want to use sleeping pads, an air mattress, blankets, or another form of cushioning to keep you off the hard surface. Prepare yourself with any pillows, sheets, and blankets you might want, as well.The sleeping platform can be outfit however you want. Choose a setup that is comfortable for you when your sleeping, and easy to store when you have the platform packed away.  ",564,"['materials', 'platform', 'legs', 'car', 'bed']"
"['consult your doctor', 'discuss electrical cardioversion', 'ask about catheter ablation', 'choose a pacemaker if your heart beats too slowly', 'ask your doctor about an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd)', 'discuss a heart maze procedure']",How to Choose a Treatment for Arrhythmia2," Your doctor will try available medications to control your arrhythmia before resorting to an invasive therapy option or inserting a rhythm-stabilizing device. If your arrhythmia doesn’t respond to medication, the medications produce too many side effects, or your doctor determines that you’re at risk for serious complications that require more than medication, then they will discuss your options. Which option is right for you will depend on your medical history and type of arrhythmia.  , If none of the anti-arrhythmic medications have effectively controlled your arrhythmia, then you may be a candidate for electrical cardioversion. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are the most common forms of arrhythmia that respond to electrical cardioversion.The procedure involves delivering a small electrical signal to your heart to stabilize the rhythm., An electrophysiologist can use catheter ablation to correct a variety of arrhythmias, including AFib, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia, which is potentially life threatening.For this procedure, your doctor will insert a small catheter into your heart and deliver high-frequency currents to the tissue causing the arrhythmia.This essentially “disconnects” the faulty pathway, resulting in a normal heartbeat.   Because this procedure is more invasive than electrical cardioversion, your doctor may try the latter option first, followed by ablation if necessary. This is a short procedure (two to four hours), and you can typically resume normal activities within a few days with a low risk of any complication.  , If your arrhythmia causes your heart to beat too slowly, then your doctor will likely discuss the option of a pacemaker.Unfortunately, no medications are available to treat a slow heart rate (bradycardia). A pacemaker includes a very small set of wires that measure the electrical activity in your heart. They connect to a small pulse generator that delivers a signal to normalize your heart’s rate whenever it detects an abnormality.Though it sounds very invasive, the procedure is considered very safe and requires only one night in a hospital while the team monitors your heart rate and rhythm to ensure proper functioning of the device.Because of their ability to interfere with your pacemaker, you should avoid strong magnetic fields and power-generating equipment (getting an MRI or using arc welding equipment, for instance). You should also avoid storing an electronic device such as your cell phone in your chest pocket next to your pacemaker.  , An ICD is similar to a pacemaker (leads inserted into the heart connected to a pulse generator), but they are used to treat a wider range of arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, both of which can be life threatening.Before you consider an ICD, your arrhythmia must be life-threatening and originate from an uncorrectable cause such as: acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), myocardial ischemia (inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle), or electrolyte imbalance and drug toxicity. If you choose an ICD, you can maintain a normal lifestyle, including taking part in sports and exercise. Your ICD may need to get checked several times a year, although their batteries last between five and seven years. To help protect the ICD’s pulse generator, you will need to avoid large magnetic fields and energy-generating equipment (such as MRIs and arc welding equipment, for example). You should also avoid placing your cell phone or headphones within six inches of the device.  , If nothing else has controlled your atrial fibrillation, then your doctor may discuss the option of a heart Maze procedure, which can be minimally invasive cardiac surgery or is an open heart surgery.In the surgery, the doctor creates small cuts that are stitched together and scar tissue forms, which interferes with abnormal impulses.",598,"['catheter ablation', 'doctor', 'electrical cardioversion', 'pacemaker', 'heart', 'implantable cardioverter-defibrillator', 'icd', 'heart maze procedure']"

The only good reason to try the cute look is because you really identify with it as part of your own personality.; , Regardless of your appearance, having confidence in your own abilities and having a sense of self-worth is an important part of being a happy and fulfilled person. Being cute isn't just about having a sweet appearance; it's also about feeling good about yourself so that you feel confident in front of other people and don't gain insecurities or need to chase other people's approval.  , Start by knowing what a bad attitude is. It is feeling less than others around you and turning that into gossiping, spreading rumors and dissing them. None of these things will help you to feel any better and they'll gain you a reputation for being unfriendly and insecure. A cute girl is cute because her attitude radiates friendliness, kindness and acceptance of self and others. Aim for that to be your attitude too.  , Don't change for some guy or girl.

Do you feel like you are in physical danger from him? Has he made non-physical threats, like harming your emotional or financial stability, alienating you from friends or family, or keeping you from dating other guys? If his behavior is merely annoying or mildly disturbing your social life, but you do not feel afraid of him, move on to the next section. If you are not sure if he is dangerous, ask someone you trust, preferably who has met him and seen some of the worrisome behaviors firsthand.; , Even if he initiates it, do not respond to any calls or messages. This will only encourage him to continue since he succeeded in engaging you. If he keeps calling or texting you, change your number and ask the phone company to keep your number unlisted and to block it from appearing on others’ caller ID. This is not foolproof, but in most instances can be done. Cut him off from your social media as much as possible. Sometimes you can’t control this, especially when they are “friends of friends.” If he is commenting on your mutual friends’ posts, ask them not to tag you and change your privacy setting to friends only., This includes attempts to contact you through mutual friends, family members or neighbors. To report stalking or threats, you will need to show proof. Keep any voicemails, texts, or messages he sends you to give the judge. Download and print out text messages or take screen shots of them to print. Print emails or messages on social media.Bring witnesses if possible. Witnesses should have actually seen the behavior or have direct knowledge of it from him.  , Rules for getting a restraining or protective order from the courts are different in every state, so research your state’s laws. Some states require a verbal threat of physical harm or verifiable intent to attack in order to get a protective or restraining order issued. However, your state may also have anti-stalking laws, so research those too.If you cannot meet the burden of proof for needing a protective order, but his actions result in a pending and related court case, a judge may be willing to issue a no-contact order if you explain why you feel you need one. “No-contact” means that he cannot try to reach you directly or indirectly. In essence, he can get into more trouble for any attempt to contact you, even through others, or showing up in places you frequent that he has no reason to visit., Keep a cell phone on you at all times and turn on 1-number emergency dialing if your phone allows.   If you don’t have a cell phone, there are programs that may be able to provide you one for free.If you are not in immediate danger, but feel a threat is imminent and don't know who to talk to, call the National Domestic Abuse Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE to get advice or a referral for legal assistance.Trust your instincts. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. Don’t worry about how he will react if you call the police or whether or not you are overreacting. Put your safety and mental health before any considerations of his feelings, and trust your gut feeling., If your school or office has security, give them a description and a picture, if possible, with a brief explanation of the situation.Make sure your friends and co-workers know not to give your personal information to anyone without your express permission—no matter what story they may tell about why they need to get in touch with you right away. Ask your school’s office or human resources department at work to put a note in your file describing the problem so that any new staff are aware of what is going on. Don’t be embarrassed about it. It is never your fault that someone else will not leave you alone when told to. It’s better to admit to others what is going on than to let a lack of knowledge cause serious problems for you or them later., When you go to the gym or walk to class, ask a friend to go with you. Don’t stay at the library or at work late by yourself. Get a family member to walk the dog with you.   Always park you vehicle in a well-lit area and get someone to escort you if at all possible.If you absolutely cannot find someone to be with you, carry a defensive tool like pepper spray or a panic button with you when alone.

If it does, then you will need to proceed through regular probate.  , Provided you are either the personal representative or a beneficiary, you may get the “Petition for Summary Administration” from the County Clerk., If you are filing for a summary administration because the estate is valued at less than $75,000, you will need to personally attest that you know of no debts against the estate that have not been paid or do not have provisions in place for being paid.Performing a thorough credit check. To gain access to the deceased’s credit reports, you will need letters of testamentary indicating that you are the estate’s personal representative.However, no personal representative is named in a summary administration. Nevertheless, if debts exist, you will be liable for them for up to two years.If you are unsure of the deceased’s debts, you may want to forego Summary Administration. If you are filing because two years have passed since the decedent’s death, then you will not have to worry about debt claims against the estate. Florida has a non-claim provision that bars claims after two years of the decedent’s death., You must fill the form out accurately. You must attest that the there are no debts claimed against the estate.  , If the spouse of the decedent is still living, then he or she must verify and sign the form.  , If any beneficiary refuses to sign, mail him a copy of the petition.   Send it certified mail so you will have proof of receipt. You may want to avoid summary disposition if you think a beneficiary will object to your plans to dispose of assets. Instead, regular probate may be preferable.  , You should have consulted with beneficiaries about how the assets will be distributed. Come to agreement on timing.   Draft the plan and make sure that all beneficiaries sign it. Asking them to sign the plan will force beneficiaries to fully consider whether or not they agree with the distribution plan.  , Attach all necessary documents: a list of assets and values, any information about debt, the plan for distributing assets, a copy of the will (if applicable), and a certified copy of the death certificate. You or your lawyer must sign the petition.  , Use a formal process server who will provide documentation that the other beneficiaries have been served.   Process servers can be found on the internet and run between $20-100 for each service.  , If the decedent owned a Floridian home and used it as the primary residence, then that home will pass to the heirs under the Florida constitution. However, to make sure that the heirs receive clear title, a separate action must be filed.File at the same time as the Summary Administration.

You should stop in or call and request it. Many police departments have a special “Office of Police Accountability” or its equivalent, which is charged with investigating allegations of police misconduct.You can find this office by looking at the police department’s website.   Typically, you can complete the form by writing in the information, although you may want to think about using a typewriter if your handwriting isn’t neat. Some forms can be completed entirely online.; , All forms will request that you provide your personal information, unless you are reporting anonymously. You should provide the following information:name date of birth age gender race or ethnicity home address and telephone number work address and telephone number any other means of contacting you  , You need to give the police sufficient detail about the incident so that they can properly investigate. Each complaint form will be a little different, but generally you will be asked to provide the following:location of the incident incident date and time general nature of the incident (such as “excessive force” or “insulting language”) detailed description of the incident  , The form should also ask that you identify the officers involved in the incident. Go through the notes you took after the incident and find the following information:name rank race sex other identifying physical attributes (hair color, eye color, height, etc.) vehicle ID badge number unit number  , Some forms will request that you provide information about anyone who witnessed the incident. Be sure to provide as much identifying information as possible, including:name address phone number  , Some complaint forms will request that you suggest how you want the dispute resolved.For example, you might be willing to go to mediation with the officer to try and come to an agreement about money compensation for your injuries.  , You will have to certify, under penalty of perjury, that the statements you made in the affidavit are true and correct.For this reason, you should closely reread your complaint and double-check the information.   You may also have to sign in front of a notary public. Check your form.You can find notaries at the courthouse, town office, or at many large banks. Be sure to bring acceptable methods of identification to show the notary, such as a driver’s license or a passport.  , You should make at least one copy of the affidavit for your own records. If you think you want to bring a lawsuit later on against law enforcement, then make a couple more copies for your attorney and others.   If you completed an online affidavit, then print off the screen after you have entered all of the information.  , You should look at the form to see how to file the form. If it doesn’t list a specific method of filing, then you can generally file the form using any of the following methods:email it to the appropriate department mail it to the police department fax the complaint hand deliver it to the police department  , As the department investigates, they may contact you for additional information. You should provide all requested information promptly. Each department sets its own timetable for investigating a claim.   Generally, you will hear back sooner if the alleged police misconduct was less serious (such as failure to show a police badge). More serious allegations might require more investigation. Typically, the department should respond in writing or by calling you., You can file an affidavit against law enforcement if you believe they have mistreated you. Police mistreatment can take many forms. Some of the more common include the following:harassment use of excessive force language or conduct that is insulting or demeaning discriminatory treatment failure to display identification refusal to identify themselves by name and badge number retaliation against you for reporting prior mistreatment  , As best as you can, you should document the police mistreatment. As soon as possible, you should sit down and write out a description of the events that took place. You should also find the following, if possible:   Witnesses. Many confrontations with the police happen in public. Bystanders might have seen the incident. Try to get their names and contact information. Video. Most smart phones have video recording capabilities. If someone witnessed the incident, they might have videotaped it. Pictures. If the police used excessive force, then you might have sustained injuries. Take vivid color photographs of your injuries. You can provide the police with copies when you submit your complaint., Some police departments let you complain anonymously. You should carefully weigh the pros and cons of anonymous reporting. For example, consider the following:   You might want to report anonymously if you are afraid of the police officers involved in the incident. By reporting anonymously, you can protect yourself. However, refusing to give your name could make it harder for the police to investigate the incident, especially if you were the victim and not a bystander. You might want to give your name if you are thinking about filing a lawsuit against the police. You also should give your name if you were a bystander but you want to testify against the police should they be prosecuted.  , Your police department might set a deadline for filing complaints against law enforcement. For example, the District of Columbia gives you only 90 days to report complaints.As soon as you feel comfortable, you should reach out to the police department and get an affidavit form to complete.

"['consider false lashes', 'apply the false lashes properly', 'curl your lashes', 'add eyeliner to the base and underside of your top lashline']",How to Lengthen Eyelashes Without Mascara1," The most common way to lengthen your lashes without mascara is to apply false eyelashes. You can find false lashes in full strips that fit your entire lashline or individual clusters that you can place exactly where you want extra length.Full strip false lashes offer the most dramatic look, so they work best if you want major length for your lashes. Individual lashes work best if you want a more natural, subtle look. You may need to cut or trim strip lashes to fit your eye shape. Always test a pair before trying to put them on.; , To secure the lashes to your lid, apply lash glue to the false lash band or cluster. Let the glue sit for 30 seconds to 1 minute so it dries and becomes slightly tacky. Set the lashes just above your natural lash line starting at the outer corner and pressing inward to secure them.When you’re applying your lashes, it helps to set your mirror below you and tilt your chin downward so you can place the lashes at the right angle. After you’ve applied the lashes to your eye, let them sit for another 30 seconds to 1 minute to ensure that the glue has bonded with your skin. To remove the lashes at the end of the day, simply peel up one of the edges and gently pull the lashes off. You may need to use eye makeup remover to take off any glue residue that may be on your lashes or skin.  , When your lashes are perfectly straight, they tend to look shorter and more sparse. Curling them helps lift the lashes so they have a longer appearance. Use an eyelash curler to curl your lashes along their entire length for the longest look.You can purchase an eyelash curler at drugstores, beauty supply stores, or any store that sells cosmetics. Start with the eyelash curler at the base of your lashes, and hold it closed for approximately 3 seconds. Next, move the curler to the center of your lashes and hold it closed for another 3 seconds. Finally, place the curler at the end of your lashes and hold it closed for a final 3 seconds. If you don’t have an eyelash curler, you can use a clean toothbrush to help curl your lashes. Run the brush under hot water and then dry it lightly with a clean towel. Next, run the brush through your lashes, starting at the base and holding it at the tips for several seconds to create the curl., If you want to skip mascara, using eyeliner strategically can help make your lashes appear longer. Instead of applying the liner to your lid, trace it right along the base of your lashes. Next, gently pull up on your eyelid to expose the underside of your lashline, also known as the tightline, and apply liner there as well to make your lashes appear thicker and longer.Use a dark eyeliner so it blends in with your lashes. Black is usually the best option, but if your lashes are light, you may prefer a brown liner. For the liner at the base of your lashes, you can use pencil, powder, liquid, or cream eyeliner. For the tightline, use a pencil or cream liner.  ",545,"['underside', 'top lashline', 'false lashes', 'eyeliner', 'base', 'lashes']"

Always have cover available within a few feet in case someone begins unloading in your direction. It's a good idea to blind fire from cover when someone is rushing you. This should kill them without exposing yourself. However, it is important to know which cover offers you the most protection, as many of the sandbags do not protect you from getting shot in most cases.; , Go as fast as you can to the big guns on the map. Getting them is a huge advantage in most cases. Watch out for the opposite team. They could have the same idea.  , Talk with your teammates. Tell them where you are going and try to come up with a plan. Always designate one person to watch the rear. Try to outmaneuver your opponent with pincer moves and flanking.  , This is a great way not to end up with a cap in your back. Roll away and to the sides of incoming fire. A strategy that the best players employ is wall bouncing, in which you try to use the cover system to your advantage by jumping on and off cover objects, while shooting your opponent. This makes it extremely difficult for your opponent to get a good shot on you, especially if you have taken any damage and need to recuperate.  ,, Only use it if you are surprising someone.  , Sometimes if you shoot your enemy in the stomach, it will down them, but don't depend on that. Most of the time if you hit anywhere other then the head your target will just roll into cover and regenerate their health. A good tip for sniping heads, especially if your target is moving, is to aim the reticule where you think your opponents' head will be, then waiting for the reticule to turn red and remove the players' dome. Also remember that there is bullet lag so in this case shoot your sniper and see how much time it takes for the bullet to the wall and then when you see an enemy you shoot ahead of them also in the area of where the head is going to be and shoot then the target should run right into the bullet.  , Melee with an equipped frag to ""tag"" someone. They will then blow up. Don't forget to dive out of the way so you don't die with them! In terms of throwing the grenades, they can be very effective if the proper tactics are used. For example, if your enemy is taking cover behind a truck, throw a grenade on either side so the only option for him is to roll forward, right into the arms of your loving shotgun. Grenades that are thrown, but not close enough to your enemy for them to explode, will sometimes stun them, giving you an ample opportunity for the kill.  , Better bullets give you an advantage over other people if they do not have the active reload.  , Aim at the head, and you can get a headshot. But when things get up close, it is a very effective melee weapon! Melee someone twice and they will drop to their knees. Don't forget that after you melee someone, there's a split second that they won't be able to shoot. Usually the pistol is most effective at mid to close range.  , Just stop what you are doing and help your teammate. Not only will they be very thankful, but they also might return the favor in a later round.  , It may seem obvious, but knowing where every single weapon is definitely gives you an advantage over those who don't.

"['on windows', 'on mac', 'on linux', 'find the saves folder', 'find somewhere safe to put it', 'upload it to somewhere safe']",How to Create a Back Up of Your World on Minecraft," Minecraft’s folder is always stored in a hidden folder in your user profile’s directory unless you manually moved it to another directory. Windows, Mac and Linux computers have different default directories for the minecraft folder. The .minecraft folder will be found on the AppData folder, which is a hidden folder on the main directory of your user. The easiest method would be to press the Start button and the ‘R’ key at the same time, which brings you to the launch window which lets you run or access files and folders in your computer, then typing %appdata% then pressing enter. You could also press the windows key and then enter in %appdata% and select the AppData folder.   You could also manually access it by going to your user profile directory folder, which you can access by clicking on the Start menu or pressing the Start button on the keyboard and clicking on your user profile name. The AppData folder is a hidden folder though, so if you don’t know how to show hidden folders, open up Windows Explorer, click on the Organize tab on the upper left side of the window, and click on the Folder and Search Options on the drop-down menu. Afterwards, click on the View tab, scroll down a bit, and click on the check box that says Show hidden files and folders. After that, the Appdata would appear with a lighter-looking folder icon, which means you can access the folders within. Once you access your AppData folder, double-click on the Roaming folder, and you’ll be able to find the .minecraft folder where all your saves are hidden away!; , On Mac, you can access the minecraft folder by clicking on the Finder tab on the menu bar of your desktop, then clicking on the Go option. Type ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft into the text field and click Go, and you’ll be able to access your saves! This is the fastest way to navigate through your files and brings you directly into the folder.  , On Linux, seeing as there are too many versions of it to truly create a generalized instruction for it, this will just tell you where to find the directory using the command terminal. Pull up your command terminal (there are too many versions of Linux to reliably generalize this step), and type in /home/yourusername/.minecraft and it’ll lead you directly to the folder. Take note that the .minecraft directory is hidden in your home folder, like with the AppData folder in Windows.   Alternately, you can use the find command. Type in the command line find -iname ""minecraft"" and press enter, and you’ll be taken there. A lot of GUIs for Linux resemble the Windows or Mac navigation, and are similar enough that the other steps can apply to it.  , Now that you’re in the .minecraft folder, you’ll see plenty of folders, but the most important folder is the saves folder. The saves folder holds all the worlds of your game, so if you are looking to backup all your worlds, copy that entire folder. If you are looking for a specific world, double-click on the saves folder and you’ll see a collection of folders with the same names as your worlds. From there, you can copy whichever world you want to backup.  , All three OS function similarly when copying and pasting the files into other directories: press ctrl+ C (cmd+c in Mac) or right click and select copy. Now, simply paste your folders into a desired folder of your computer, or you could copy it into a USB flash drive or portable hard drive!  , There are many websites that allow you to upload folders and files called file hosting sites. Some well-known examples are Mediafire, Dropbox or Megaupload (currently known as Mega). Most file hosting sites require membership, but a free one would suffice. Each website has different instructions, but generally speaking, you just drag and drop the folder into a specified box in the website, and it will upload it. Now that you have a backup, and presumably in multiple places, you can now breathe easy knowing that your worlds have another layer of safety! Crafting and messing around in the game may be fun, but always be careful when messing with it, both in-game and outside!  ",716,"['linux', 'windows', 'mac', 'folder']"

Consider what you want to accomplish with your talk.   Illicit a response. That response may be emotional, intellectual or action-oriented. Convince the audience. An argumentative speech aims at presenting a specific point of view and bringing the audience to a point of relating, or agreeing, with that point of view. Teach the audience. The purpose of an informative speech is to educate the audience on a subject or idea that they may not be familiar with.; , When you prepare a speech, it is important that you take your intended audience into consideration.   Identifying characteristics. These include age, race, common interests, socioeconomic class, gender and education. It is important that you are careful not to alienate your audience with the language or tone of your talk. Audience knowledge. Consider how informed your audience is on the issue of your talk, and what type of understanding they are seeking from your talk. This will determine the depth of information you need to provide in your speech.  , Your introduction should grab the audience's attention, inform the audience of the talk purpose (thesis) and lead into the main body. For example, you may grab your audience's attention with a personal story, present your thesis by explaining how the story illustrates the purpose of your speech and lead into the body with a strong transition phrase. Fill the body with relevant content. Identify points that reinforce your thesis and organize the body of your talk accordingly. Illustrate each point clearly, providing supporting information to give audience a clear picture of how each point lends itself to your thesis. 3 to 5 supporting points is standard, depending on the time constraints of your talk. Close with an effective conclusion. Prepare a speech conclusion that reminds the audience of each of your main points, then restates the thesis. Include a call to action in your conclusion that incites the audience to partake in a realistic response to what they've just learned. For example, if your speech was about the importance of parental involvement in education, your call to action may be to instruct the audience to participate in their children's education by joining parent-teacher conferences, voting on education reform and helping with homework.  ,   Ethos involves gaining the audience's trust by establishing trustworthiness. Be genuine in your approach, and reveal your personal stake in what you have to say. Pathos involves appealing to the audience's emotions. You may do this by using a personable tone, and by providing supporting information that the audience relates to. Engage the audience's logos sensibility by providing reliable and factual data to back up your thesis.  ,   Use short, concise sentences. Incorporate clear transitions from 1 point to the next. Repeat important words and phrases several times throughout the speech. Provide previews and summaries of the information you relay as you move through each segment of the speech. Avoid overusing statistical information, as it may be too much information for the audience to take in on an auditory basis. Avoid using pronouns like ""it"" and ""this"" in favor of specific nouns.  , You may opt to summarize your talk into outline format, or you may transfer your key points onto cue cards. Rehearse your speech out loud, using your outline or cue cards as a reference, until you are comfortable with your ability to deliver the material without prompts.

Don't take your eyes off them. If the person disappears beneath the snow, note where you last saw them, and continue to watch downhill to see if they resurface.; , If you're following proper avalanche safety techniques, only one person should be in the danger zone at a time. Make sure the avalanche has completely stopped before others enter the slope.  , Quickly look for any sign of the victim. Sometimes a ski tip or article of clothing will be just above the surface. If the person was carrying an avalanche cord, look for that.  , If the victim is wearing an emergency beacon, you may be able to quickly locate him or her.   Switch emergency beacons into receive mode. All members of the party should switch their beacons to ""receive"" mode to attempt to locate the buried person.       Proceed to the spot where the victim was last seen.       Search for a signal.       Quickly move in the direction in which the signal is strongest. Walk 10–15 feet (3.0–4.6 m) in one direction. If the signal weakens, quickly go the opposite direction. Follow the signal as long as it keeps getting stronger until you can pinpoint the victim's location.        , If the person is conscious, he or she will probably try to cry out. Periodically stop for just a few seconds and silently listen for faint noises beneath the snow. Depending on the depth of burial, keep in mind that you may not be able to hear them.  , If the victim was wearing a beacon, use avalanche probes to probe the area where the signal is strongest. Otherwise begin probing where you last saw the victim and move downhill from there. Probe areas where the greatest amount of snow was deposited first. If several rescuers are available, fan out logically to maximize efficiency.  , Once the victim is found with a probe, leave the probe in the snow as a guide. Note the depth of burial.  , If the victim is buried fairly deep in the snow, you'll need to dig a large hole to get at him. As a rule, the hole will need to be at least as large as the square of the depth of burial (that is, if the victim is buried 5 feet beneath the surface, the hole would need to be 5 feet wide by 5 feet long). Start digging downhill from the probe, and throw the snow downhill.  , If you have multiple rescuers, don't get in each others' way by all digging at once. Instead, maximize digging speed by taking shifts. Whenever one person starts to tire, he should rest and another person should take his place.  , As soon as you can see the victim, try to free his head. Asphyxiation is the primary cause of death in avalanches, so it's essential to get the person breathing as quickly as possible. Begin CPR, if needed, immediately after uncovering the person's head and chest.  , If the victim cannot move on his own, do not attempt to move him unless absolutely necessary. He may have broken bones and internal injuries.  ",532,"['surface', 'someone', 'person', 'area', 'avalanche slope', 'snow', 'location', 'victim', 'danger', 'help', 'use avalanche beacons', 'head']"

But remember that $550 you saw was only for departing flight. When you go for choosing Returning flight, there is another $550, so now your total is $1100. Site B comes out cheaper as it showed you final prices for both flights.; , Flights are cheapest in January and most expensive in July and August. If you keep an eye out for specials you can often find $200 flights from the east coast and $300 flights from the west coast in January, round trip. At the peak of summer, it's often hard to find it for less than $1000 even if you do everything right.  , Don't wait until the last minute, as fares really go up. However, they also can be higher if you try to book too far in advance. Try to arrange it a couple of months before flying.  , It's cheaper to fly on Tuesday or Wednesday than any other days of the week. Booking both your outward and return journeys on one of these days can save you $100 or more when booking a flight.  , Several airlines fly into London Gatwick, and recently two new airlines have started flying from New York and DC to London Stansted.  , Non-US airlines can have significantly cheaper flights, which are made even less expensive with the exchange rate between the Canadian and US dollars (though at the moment, the exchange rate is nearly 1:1, so it's not much of a difference as it once was).  , This is pretty obvious, but there are many websites that will allow you to compare fares.  , Most US carriers require 50,000 miles (80,000 km) for a round trip to London. A penny a mile is a pretty fair price to pay your friends. So if the flights you find are significantly higher than $500, this could be a real win-win for both of you. Keep in mind that it can be hard to find frequent flier seats at the last minute, so book early, and make sure there's a seat for you before you rely on this.  , If you're a student, consider searching the web for ""student travel"" and you should find some decent student-focused travel agencies that usually offer flights from NY to London for $250 roundtrip over the summer.  , If you are flexible on timing, are traveling alone, and don't need to take much luggage, consider courier flights. You'll be expected to dress reasonably smartly, pick up a small package at the airport, and hand it over to an agent at the airport in London - in return you'll get a very cheap fare.  , Many large online booking services offer email or SMS updates should rates decrease or meet your price requirements for flights to a specific location.

Look for any bare walls that could use some decoration or an old space that needs a fresh look. Take notes on details of the space that you are planning on using.   Take measurements of the space. Take notes of existing decorations and colors. Think of any possible layouts for a decal.; , Locate a decal that will be the best fit for your space. Use your measurements and notes about your space to help your selection.   Try to find colors that work well together. Find the right size decal for the space. Think about how the decals shape and design will make the space feel. Select a decal that you will enjoy!  , Removing any dirt or oil from the surface is very important. Making a clean surface will allow the decal to adhere properly. Leaving dirt or oil behind will cause the decal to adhere to them, rather than the wall.         Remove dirt and oil for best application. Remove dirt with a damp sponge. Use a small amount of soap to remove oil. Be sure the wall is dry before placing the decal.  , Double check the decal is going to look great in the place you have selected. Removing a decal is possible, but most will not be reusable. Ensure that you are satisfied with where you are considering placing the decal to avoid ruining it.         Leave the paper backing on and temporarily tape the decal to the wall. Step back and examine how the decal fits the space. Make any adjustments until you are happy with how it looks.  , Get your ruler and a pencil ready. Use your initial placement of the decal to help you as you draw a light guideline. This guideline will show you exactly where to place the decal when you apply it.   Hold your level flat against the wall. Move the levels ends up or down, left or right, until the air bubble is centered. Draw a light line on the wall, along the edge of the level, to make your guideline.  , Placing the decal requires accuracy and focus. Stick the decal as close as you can to the guideline you created for it.          Remove the covering that protects the adhesive side of the decal. Line up the decal with your guideline. Carefully stick the decal to the area you have selected. Work slowly and take your time to ensure accuracy.  , Using a squeegee, smooth the surface and remove any air bubbles that may be present. Leaving air bubbles can cause an uneven finish and improper adherence to a surface.Work from the middle and move outwards. Always push air bubbles outwards towards an edge to remove them. Aim for as smooth a surface as you can.  , Paper backing protects the face of your decal, but now it's time to unveil your new decal.

Look at your freshly washed face and cover any major flaws (i.e. acne, scars, rashes, bumps, or skin texture variations) with concealer. The concealer should have a yellowish undertone to provide with the best coverage. Cover the areas with a light blendable powder using a large brush. If you want a professional look over a natural one, use a liquid foundation mixed with sunscreen and apply it with a brush to your skin. Avoid using too much and make sure to blend it in to the hairline and jaw line well. If you want a more natural look use bronzer or blush on your cheeks,nose and forehead to create the illusion of being sun kissed.

"['learn how to communicate assertively', 'listen actively', 'be specific', 'ask for one thing at a time', 'let your partner know your boundaries', 'avoid blame', 'accept your partner’s differences']",How to Talk to Your Partner About Your Wants and Needs2," If you are feeling like your needs are not being met in your relationship, then this might be partially due to a lack of assertive communication. To ensure that you are communicating with your partner as effectively as possible, try to develop some assertive communication skills.  If something is not going the way you want, say it right then instead of waiting or silently dealing with your frustration. For example, if your partner gives a short answer when you ask about his or her day after work, then you might say, ""When I ask you about your day, I'd love to know all the details even if you think they're boring. I'm still interested.""  , You should listen to what your partner says. This is important when they are responding to your wants and needs and telling you what they need. Your partner may believe they have been meeting your wants and needs, or have a different way of approaching things. Listen to what your partner says with an open mind and respectful attitude.Don’t get mad if your partner doesn’t agree with you or understand right away. Be open to listening to their point of views so you can come to a compromise.  , When you tell your partner about your wants and needs, make sure to be specific and clear. Being vague or speaking in general terms may only create confusion. Your partner may not know exactly what you mean, or their interpretation of the general statement may be different than yours.For example, if you say, “I need more intimacy,” your partner may get the general idea but not know exactly what you need. Their version of intimacy may be different than yours. Instead, be specific. You might say, “I need you to kiss me more often and talk to me about your day.”  , If you have never told your partner what you want or need, you may have many things you want to ask for. However, try not to overwhelm your partner by asking for too much at one time. This might make it seem like your partner is doing everything wrong or cause unneeded stress in your relationship. Instead, ask for one thing at a time.Start with the most important thing that you need from your partner. Once the two of you have worked on it, you can move on to another want.  , Telling your partner about your wants and needs doesn’t just include things you want to happen. It also can include things you don’t want to happen. You should tell your partner know what your boundaries are so they can give you want you want and need.For example, you should tell your partner where your privacy boundaries are. If there are things, boxes, or boxes that are private and off-limits, explain this to your partner. If you have sexual boundaries, you should explain these clearly to your partner. There may be some negotiation where your sexual needs and wants are concerned, but if there are things you are unwilling to do, let your partner know. Try saying, ""I don't feel comfortable fulfilling all of your fantasies. However, I am willing to try a few new things that you want to.""  , If there are needs or wants that may stem from a conflict, try not to blame your partner. Instead, use “I” statements and keep things factual and calm. Blaming or being dramatic will not do anything to solve the conflict or get your needs met.   For example, if you feel the house is a mess, you may want to say, “You never do anything to help around the house!” or “The house looks like a tornado hit it!” Instead, be factual and say, “The house is messy right now” or “Things are not as neat as they could be.” Keep the statements about you instead of your partner. For example, don’t say, “You are being clingy.” Instead, say, “I miss spending time with my friends.”  , You and your partner come from different backgrounds, even if you grew up in similar areas. This means that the way you and your partner approach certain things may differ. You may solve problems differently, have different levels of communication, or show affection different ways.As you think about what you want and need, you should consider the way your partner handles things. If you need your partner to show affection, they may be showing affection in their way. You need to figure out how your partner may be meeting your needs in their own unique way. This doesn’t mean you can’t ask for your partner to do things you need, but your partner may think they are already meeting your needs. You might say, ""I understand that you think sitting side by side on the couch is spending quality time together. However, I would like you to touch me and talk to me in the evenings instead of just watching television. We can talk for half an hour and then watch a television program.""

Harley Quinn does have messy hair, but you want to keep things neat at this point. You will mess them up later.; , Harley has unkempt, rumpled hair. It will be easier to get this look if your hair is slightly curly or wavy. If you have straight hair, use a large curling iron to add loose waves to it. You can also spray your hair with a dry texturizing spray to help give it more volume. Don't worry above making it perfect or neat.  , Secure each pigtail with a hair tie. The pigtails need sit above your eyebrows and slightly behind your ears.Be sure to leave a few strands from your front hairline hanging loose. This is one of the key parts of Harley's look.If you have bangs, consider leaving them out completely., Use blue for the left pigtail and red or light pink for the right. Apply the hairspray from midway-down and be sure to work in small sections. Don't worry about making the color end in a straight line. A little unevenness would work great for Harley.This step can get messy. Wear an old shirt or drape a towel over your shoulders. Wearing plastic gloves might also help., Take a thin strand of hair from under your left pigtail. Wrap it around the base to hide the hair tie, then secure it with a bobby pin. Repeat the process for the right pigtail.Try to finish wrapping the hair strands underneath the pigtails. You can also wrap a blue ribbon around your left pigtail, and a red ribbon around the right pigtail. Secure them with bobby pins or strips of double-sided tape., This depends on how messy your hair got during the previous steps and how voluminous it is to begin with. If your hair still looks too sleek, backcomb the pigtails from midway down. If your hair is still too thin, backcomb them all the way up to the base, where the hair ties are., If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, the colored hairspray might be enough to hold the style. If your hair is straight or smooth, consider spraying it with a lightweight hairspray to help hold the style.  , Use the handle of a rattail comb to part your hair right in the middle, from your forehead all the way down to the nape of your neck.Harley Quinn does have messy hair, but you will do that at the end. Keep things neat for now.  , The pigtails need to sit right on top of your head, above your eyebrows and behind your ears. Use a comb or brush to smooth the hair down as much as possible. Leave a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) strand of hair hanging loose on each side of your part., Hair chalk can be applied to wet or dry hair, but it will be brighter on dark hair. If you hair is dark blond, brown, or even darker, the hair chalk won't show up very well if you apply it to dry hair. Mist your hair down with a spray bottle filled with water, then comb it through.You only need to dampen your hair about midway down.  , You will need to use bright blue for the left pigtail and light pink or red for the right pigtail. Start adding the colors about midway down.Work with 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide sections.If you damped your hair earlier, let it dry before moving on to the next step. This step can get messy. Consider putting on an old shirt or draping a towel around your shoulders first.  , If you don't do this, the chalk will rub off. Be aware that some color may rub off onto the heat tool, however.If you are using a hair straightener, twist it while straightening your hair so that you get loose waves instead. If you are using a curling iron, try using a larger one instead to get looser curls.This will help set the chalk into your hair and prevent it from rubbing off.   If you don't have a hair straightener or curling iron, you can mist it with hairspray.It won't work as well as a hair straightener or curling iron, but it will be better than nothing.  , Take a strand of hair from the underside of your first pigtail. Wrap it around the base of the pigtail to hide the elastic and weft. Secure the strand of hair with a bobby pin. Repeat this step for the other pigtail. The colored strands will give the illusion of a colored hair tie. Try to finish wrapping the hair strand on the underside of your pigtail.   You can also use a wide, satin ribbon instead. Secure it with a strip of double-sided tape instead of a bobby pin. Use blue for the left pigtail and red for the right., This will give you a messier look. Only backcomb from the middle part of the pigtails and down., Be sure to focus on the ends of your hair where the hair chalk is.

"['encourage your child to have fun', 'challenge yourself in front of your child', 'model a healthy attitude about body image', ""don't expect perfection"", 'show your child unconditional love', ""reverse your child's negative self-talk""]",How to Raise a Physically Confident Child1," Many children find physical activities fun to begin with. Let your child enjoy physical activities or games without pressuring them. For example, if your child loves to run, avoid organizing the activity or making them run for a certain amount of time each day.   If your child enjoys physical activity, they'll become more confident about their own physical abilities.; , Your child may become physically frustrated if they think that they're not good enough. It's important to let your child see that no one is perfect at everything and that they should try and practice. A good way to do this is to let your child see you try something new. Let your child know if you're struggling and let them see you stick with it.For example, you might make a habit of putting on a yoga program and letting your child watch you learn the poses. Your child will see that you have to learn and practice physical skills.  , Kids are exposed to a lot of physical expectations, whether from watching professional athletes or from making the team at school. Show your child that everyone is unique and that people have different physical capabilities. Avoid talking badly about yourself in front of your kids which could signal a negative physical attitude. Instead, talk to your child about any body image concerns they have.For example, instead of saying, ""I'm too old to run that fast,"" you could say, ""I need to take it a little slower."" If you notice the child struggling with their body image, talk with them about why they're not confident. Explain that everybody has physical differences and abilities.  , Show your child that you're pleased and proud when they try a new physical challenge or keep trying to learn a new skill. If you only show praise when they compete and win, they will only feel physical pressure. Instead, accept that your child might not be the best at their sport or activity, but let them know that you want them to enjoy it.   For example, you might say, ""I know you've really been sticking with soccer practice. I'm proud of how much effort you've been putting into it."" It's important for your child to try new physical challenges. If you expect perfection, they may be less likely to try new things because they fear failure. If you just encourage them to do new activities for the sake of it, they may find something they love doing.  , Your child should know without a doubt that you care more for their personality and passions than their physical abilities. Avoid focusing on their physical strengths or challenges and instead talk with them about their interests.For example, instead of saying, ""I can't believe you don't even want to try playing basketball,"" say, ""I know we talked about you doing an organized sport. What would you really like to play?""  , If you know your child has a negative opinion about their physical appearance or abilities, ask them why they have these negative thoughts. Remind your child that their thoughts affect how they feel about themselves. Instead of focusing on a fear or criticism, have your child look focus on a helpful thought.For example, you might say, ""I heard you say you'll never have friends because of how you look. Remember that your true friends shouldn't care how you look and you shouldn't have to change yourself for a  ",571,"['body image', 'child unconditional love', 'healthy attitude', 'fun', 'child', 'perfection', 'front', 'negative self-talk']"
"['sleep on a low', 'firm pillow', 'adjust your posture when you are sitting for long periods of time', 'drink lots of water throughout the day', 'do at least 150 minutes of exercise a week', 'take pain medication to help alleviate the pain']",How to Reduce Neck Tension3," Sleeping on too many pillows can cause your neck to bend unnaturally or at an awkward position that can cause neck tension. Try to sleep on only one to two pillows or get a cervical pillow, which are contoured to support your head and neck. These pillows also keep your neck aligned with your spine.The best sleeping position for reduced neck tension is on your back, with your entire spine resting comfortably on the bed. If you prefer to sleep on one side or on your stomach, your pillow should be no higher than 4 – 6 inches off the bed.  , Neck tension is often caused by sitting in one position for long periods of time, usually when working on a computer or driving in a car for several hours at a time. Adjusting your posture in these stationary positions can help to reduce neck tension and improve your spinal health.When sitting at a computer, try to adjust your posture so your alignment is correct and you are not putting excessive stress on your neck muscles. Move your computer screen so it is at eye level on your desk. Test the setup of your computer by sitting in your office chair. Make sure your gaze is directly in the center of your computer screen. You should also try to keep your head in the center of your computer screen, rather than drifting forward over your shoulders or to one side. You can also use a hands-free device, like a headset, if you talk on the phone throughout the day and do not want to have to hold the phone between your ear and your shoulder. If you are looking at any notebook or notes while typing at your computer, you can use a paper holder next to your computer screen. This will help you avoid keeping your head turned and down to one side while typing. Take breaks throughout the work day and move around every 30 minutes so your neck does not tense up or get stuck in one position.  , The spinal discs that sit between the vertebrae of your spine contain mostly water. Sipping water throughout the day will ensure your body stays hydrated and your spinal discs remain healthy and fluid. Try to drink at least five to eight glasses of water a day., Getting your body moving through exercise at least once a day can help to alleviate tension in your muscles and strengthen your muscles so they are less likely to tighten up. If you are worried about injuring your neck with intense exercise, try light exercise like a gentle yoga class, swimming, or jogging.Never put undue stress on your neck if it is stressed or tense. Avoid contact sports if you are experiencing neck tension and neck pain, as well as more intense aerobics classes.  , If your neck tension is causing discomfort that cannot be stretched out, you can take regular doses of pain medication like ibuprofen or paracetamol to control the pain.If the neck tension does not alleviate in several days or weeks, despite the use of painkillers and neck stretches, you should see your doctor. Your doctor will examine your neck and ask you questions about your daily routine to determine if your neck tension is the result of a more serious medical issue.

"['loosen the alternator bolts or the tensioner pulley', 'slide the old belt off of the pulleys', 'compare the replacement belt to the new one', 'run the new belt through all of the necessary pulleys', 'increase tension on the new belt']",How to Tighten a Drive Belt2," A loose drive belt may be the result of stretching over time. If your drive belt has stretched, it should be replaced. Depending on the vehicle, there are a number of ways you may be able to loosen the tension on the drive belt. A tensioner pulley can be loosened by inserting a breaker bar or socket wrench into the hole in the center of the pulley and twisting it clockwise. In other vehicles, you will need to loosen the alternator bolts and either tip it forward or slide it toward the motor within its bracket to loosen the belt.Check the service manual for your vehicle to determine which way you can reduce the tension on your drive belt. If your belt has been damage or is showing signs of excessive wear, it should be replaced instead of simply tightened.  , With the tension off of the belt, slide it off the top pulley. This will produce enough slack to remove it from all of the remaining ones. If your vehicle does not provide a diagram of how the drive belt is wound through the pulleys, take a picture of it before removing the belt to ensure you can place the new one on in the same fashion.The drive belt likely snakes through a number of pulleys in order to power multiple accessories within your car. You may also be able to find a diagram of the drive belt’s route on the auto maker’s website.  , Before installing a new drive belt, compare it to the old one to make sure you’ve purchased the right belt. While an old belt may stretch a bit, they should be fairly close in length and equal in width. Make sure the new belt matches the old so it will install properly.The wrong belt could fail to power the vehicle’s accessories or even cause internal damage to the engine. If you feel you have purchased the wrong belt, return it to the auto parts store and get the proper belt before moving forward.  , Follow the diagram or picture you took to run the new drive belt back through and around all of the pulleys the old one did. If your vehicle comes equipped with a tensioner pulley, turn it clockwise again to bring it closer to the other pulleys as you slide the belt over it last.Check the belt against the diagram or picture again once you’ve finished running it to ensure it looks right. You will need to maintain pressure on the tensioner pulley while getting the belt over it, so this step may be easier with a friend to help.  , Once the belt has been run through all the necessary pulleys, either release the tensioner or use a piece of wood to pry the alternator away from the motor to increase the tension in the belt. With the belt tight, bolt the alternator in place to maintain tension.Use a ruler to check to make sure the belt is under the proper amount of tension. Place the ruler along the belt and try to pull the middle of it away from the ruler. If it moves more than a half inch, it’s not tight enough.

"[""get away from everything that reminds you of him or her until you're over them"", 'go on a mini-vacation', 'get your mind off of him/her']",How to Move on from Someone Who Doesn't Like You2," This means not going to places that you had experiences with them at, putting away old pictures, and maybe even deleting their contact information from your phone or removing them from Facebook. It might seem rude, but you need to understand that you have to move on in life.   Here's one way to think about it. If you're stopped at a red light and all the sudden it goes green, everyone else is going forward with their lives and you're just stuck. You will eventually get hit by another car or fined for staying in the middle of the road. You can move, but it takes effort to put your foot to the gas. Move on. You do not want to be the person stuck at the red light any longer. If seeing them on your home page on Facebook or seeing them on your phone will bring back sudden memories or you will be tempted to contact them, you need to delete them. If you own anything of theirs, now might be a good time to give it back to them if it holds memories or is important to them. If you want to avoid seeing them altogether, you can get a friend to deliver it, or ship it in the mail. Getting rid of things that remind you of them is not the same as destroying things. It may not be a great idea to send all of their belongings up into smoke by burning it in a funeral pyre. It's recommended that you store things, shelving them away, instead of destroying things. You want to temporarily forget about the memories, not destroy them altogether.  , It can be a stay-cation if you want (late night slumber party, anyone?) or it can be a full-blown vacation, off to an exotic destination. Whatever it is, you deserve it. You're been putting in a lot of work into this, and other, relationships, which means you've earned a break.   Taking a vacation doesn't have to mean traveling far. In fact, you can still have a vacation if you stay in the same city. The trick is convincing your mind to let loose and act like you're in a totally foreign place. So meet some locals, go to a museum you've never gone to, and soak it all in.  , Hanging out with friends, joining a club (i.e. drama clubs, creative writing or book clubs, online clubs, etc.) help a lot. Do anything to get your mind off of him/her. Write song lyrics or stories, do homework, hang out with friends at the mall, watching movies; all of these things work. Make sure that you're not thinking of him or her and there is absolutely no reason for you to encounter them or think about them.   For example, if they work at the mall and your friends want to go there, don't go. Stay home and do something else. The whole point is to move on, and for most people who are in love, the moment they see their loved one again or the moment they start to communicate with them, old feelings begin coming back. So make sure you won't be seeing them at all. Try to find a hobby you're interested in such as art, music, writing, books, dance, etc. You can also kill two birds with one stone by trying to get something good done while moving on, such as losing weight, studying or doing homework, practicing for a speech or playact, or earning money.

If the power is still on when the tank is empty, your tank will almost certainly sustain significant damage. Most electric water heaters in residential applications are 208/240 volts, and supplied by a double-pole circuit breaker or two fuses rated at 30 amps.   Some gas valves have a thermostatic control knob facing forward. The ""Off - Pilot - On"" gas supply knob is located on the top, between the red interlock button the black ""push-button"" ignitor. Simply rotate the top knob from the ""On"" to the ""Off"" position to stop the flow of gas to the burner. Some electric-reliant heaters have double-pole 30 amp circuit breakers. Switch the circuit breaker from the ""On"" position to the ""Off."" Once off, there is no danger of damaging the heating elements.; , When water service is restored, the water department will be pumping water that could be contaminated. This will be fine to use for flushing toilets and for cooking, but not for drinking.   Determine whether you're dealing with a ball valve or a gate valve. Unlike a traditional gate valve's handle, which needs to be turned completely several times in order to shut off, a ball valve handle is rotated just a 1/4 turn between full on and off positions. If older, traditional gate valves were installed instead, bear in mind that the color of the handle does not guarantee an association with the temperature of the water in the pipe.  , This is where your clean drinking water will come from. Many water heater valves have a connector for hooking up a garden hose to the drain valve. A short 3 foot (0.9 m) length of garden hose will make the collection of the water easier. A washing machine's supply hose is the perfect length and is available in many homes. Connect the hose and open the valve briefly to flush any debris that may have collected in the valve. Make sure the drain, hose, and container are clean before using them.   Threads are usually provided to connect an ordinary garden hose (or washer supply hose). Some gate valves do not have a traditional handle, but rather a slot at the end of the stem where a handle would normally attach. The slot allows for operation with a screwdriver, or coin. Work this valve gently, as these valves are seldom used more than once or twice per year under normal service conditions, and could be damaged if forced.  , In order for water to be drained from the tank, you must allow air to get into it. This is easy to do by opening any hot water tap in the building such as the kitchen or bathroom sink. When either faucet is open, a sucking sound may be heard whenever water is drawn from the water heater's drain valve, and is normal.  , Water heaters are notorious for trapping sediments. The heavier-than-water sediment sinks and collects at the bottom of the tank because hot water is drawn from the top of the tank, rather than the bottom. If you have sediment in the drinking water let it stand for a period of time to let it settle to the bottom of container.   Typical mineral sediment that has settled in the hot water is usually harmless, but if your heater has an aluminum anode, there may be a lot of jelly-like aluminum corrosion by-product on the tank bottom. Many people mistakenly believe that the tank is made of glass (or another inert substance). It is not. The inside of the tank will likely be lined with glass to prevent corrosion, since corrosion is the leading cause of water heater failure. There is no danger cooking or consuming water that has been contained in a water heater.

Here's how to know if the things you say mean that you have a serious crush:   If you find yourself always teasing the guy. If you always end up poking fun at the guy without meaning to, it means you have a crush. If you talk really fast or stutter when you say anything to the guy, it means you have a crush. If you're careful about not saying anything that might make you look like a ditz or dumb in front of the guy, then you have a crush. And if you feel like everything you say to him does make you sound like a ditz, then you probably have a crush. If you can't talk to one of your friends for more than ten minutes without mentioning the guy, then you have a crush. If you have a crush, your friends may be able to pick up on it before you do.  , You can learn a lot about whether or not you have a crush on the guy based on how you act around him, or even how you act when he's miles away. Here are a few ways to know if your actions mean you've been bit by the crush bug:   If you go out of your way to hang out with him, then you have a crush on him. If you've never watched baseball in your life but are suddenly going to all the school games because you know he'll be sitting in the bleachers, then you have a crush.

If you find yourself drifting toward him when you're in a group of friends, or even touching him in a playful way whenever you can, then you have a crush. If you can't stand being around him when he's flirting with other girls, then you have a crush. If your heart falls when you show up to a place where you thought he'd be and he isn't there, then you have a crush.  , It may not be a coincidence that you're suddenly spending twice as much time in front of the mirror whenever you know you'll see the guy. Here's how to know if your grooming habits and attention to your looks say that you have a crush on the guy:   If you try twice as hard to look good if you know you'll see him. If you wear your best outfit, best hairdo, and most amazing eye makeup when you know he'll be there, then you have a crush. If you find yourself experimenting with new makeup looks or jewelry to see if he notices, then you have a crush. If you find yourself not caring at all about how you look if you go somewhere where you know you won't see him, then you have a crush.  , Let's say this guy is the athletic, typical-boy type. You might find yourself practicing basketball and soccer, or buying Nike shoes, so your guy can get interested at you. And if you want your guy to get interested at you, that basically means you have a crush on him and will kind of do anything for him.  ",571,"['looks', 'personality', 'attention']"

You should wear clothes that look good on you - something elegant, clean looking, comfortable, and at the same time, something that makes you feel confident. Remember, you don't need to have millions of expensive outfits to look beautiful because some simple fashions never go out of style!   Try sporting dark, slimming jeans, a simple solid colored tank or cami, some chunky bead necklaces, or a cute sun dress. Avoid looking like a slob or wearing any outfits that have stains or wrinkles in them.; , Be sure that you shower and clean yourself regularly. You should also wear deodorant, shave frequently, clean your ears, brush your teeth and hair, and you could try to paint your nails. Also, try to wear your hair in a style that makes you feel pretty - have a variety of hairstyles so you don't look boring!   If desired, use a perfume that smells sweet, but is not too overpowering. Two sprays on the neck and one spray on one wrist, then rub your two wrists together to transfer the scent.  , Don't stay in a group. A guy may find it a little uncomfortable to approach you if you are in a large group of people. No man can bear a rejection in front of a herd. Also, he may feel that he can't approach you because of your friends.  , Also, try to minimize the distance between the two of you. For example, you can sit at the chair next to him.  , There are multiple ways to act flirty, here are some of the best suggestions:    Compliments. Be sure to compliment him on things that are true. Be sincere. Sometimes people will make up compliments just to talk to someone, but that is a totally wrong thing to do. You really should compliment on things you actually like about a person, so you sound more natural and confident.  Eye contact. The eyes can be the most effective tool for flirting. It's possible to make a guy's heart skip a beat simply by giving him a playful, lusty, or lingering stare. Here is how to do it:  If you're walking by someone you've got the hots for, give him a 2-3 second stare and then slowly glance away (slow is important). Smile just as you start to look away. He'll get the message. Additionally, when you're talking to a guy you like, take a second to momentarily break away from his eyes and pause on his upper body or chest. Let 2 seconds pass. Then slowly move your eyes back up and make eye contact again. This will give him chills of excitement. He'll realize that you were checking him out - and he'll love it. However, be warned that shy guys will feel uncomfortable and more nervous, as much as they may like it!    Smile and giggle. According to polls, a laugh and a smile are the sexiest things a female can wear. If you perfect your smile and laugh to be seductive and sweet, you will find some great results. Practice forcing a natural smile and laugh, it can help through awkward situations.  Magic Touch  You can learn to brush a guy in such a way that you send tingles up and down his spine. Casually and gently tap him on the hand while laughing, it will give him a sense of manliness.    , Approach him and start a light conversation to get things going, but don't make it too obvious that you like him. If he approaches you, look him in the eyes as a sign of affection and confidence. The best opening line is just saying hello. Talk about what you have in common, talk about your surroundings, ask a question, ask for help, state an opinion.  , After he has come up to you and both of you have started talking, just try to find out whether he is your type or not. Is he one of the pushy ones, or will he stop at the line you draw? If you feel comfortable with him, carry on with the evening. In case he is not your type, just excuse yourself politely from his company. However, remember that you are the one who led him on. Now if you don't feel up to it, don't get outright rude.  , Just start hanging out with him, become friends first, slowly become best friends or even more, let the relationship develop naturally! You want to make sure that he is the right guy for you, and you have things in common! It's fine if he doesn't seem like your type; stick with him and you may have secured yourself a best friend for life!

"['try to come to terms with your loss', 'take steps to lessen self-consciousness', 'learn to love the bald', 'don’t try to hide it', 'go for a close-cropped look', 'shave it off', 'grow facial hair']",How to Adjust to Hair Loss and Baldness1," Many (probably all) men panic when they first see a thinning patch in their hair. Hair symbolizes vitality, sex appeal, and youth. Men fear going bald because they fear that they are losing these things. However, the truth is that it’s all in the mind. Reconciling yourself to less hair, and being proud of your baldness, could make you happier in the end.It is natural to feel some embarrassment when you first start to lose hair. The key is to neutralize this feeling of shame. You may not love the way you look at first, but you can’t allow yourself to be paralyzed by it.Learn to recognize negative feelings and then consciously let them pass. There is a big difference between thinking “I feel unattractive” and “I AM unattractive.” If you feel silly, tell yourself, “Yes, I feel foolish.” Then, move on with what you are doing without letting the thoughts control you.Some people call this a “mental shrug.” If somebody called you stupid, for instance, you would realize that they are being hostile and would probably not internalize the idea that you are stupid. You can dismiss your embarrassment at baldness in much the same way.Challenge your negative thoughts, as well. One reason you might feel embarrassed is that you agree with the “conventional” view of baldness – that it is somehow undesirable or unattractive. This sort of thinking can lead you to internalize the thoughts.; , Do away with “conventional” definitions of attractiveness, for one, and try to cultivate a healthier self-image. The media may show the ideal man one way, but there are many ways to be a strong and handsome man. You can adopt a different view.Don’t compare yourself to others. Every individual has a unique makeup. It does no good to look at other men and envy them for their looks or fuller head of hair. The men you see in the movies and in magazines are also not entirely real, in that they have the benefit of things like cosmetic treatments and airbrushing. Take pride in things other than looks. Looks define you, but so do your talents, your interests, and your relationships. Find things that you like about yourself, like the fact that you have a fine baritone voice or are a great fullback on your soccer team. Take a break from mirrors. If you find yourself obsessing about your hair, take a break. Stop yourself from constantly checking your hair line in the rear-view mirror or in shop windows. In these moments, remind yourself of one of your great inner qualities., Your goal shouldn’t just be toleration of how you look, but pride and acceptance. Remember that you are not alone. Baldness is a part of being male and there is no reason to let it control your emotions. In fact, one of the most powerful things you can do to combat hair loss is to not just live with it but embrace it – learn to love the bald.   Accept it. 50 million men in the US have some amount of hair loss, and hair loss increases as we age. In fact, about 50% of men have some hair loss by age 50, while 80% experience it by age 70.Remind yourself of famous, powerful, and sexy bald men. What do Sean Connery, Patrick Stewart, Michael Jordan, Bruce Willis, and LL Cool J have in common? They are all bald – and they don’t hide it.Keep in mind that some women find bald men very attractive. What many find especially attractive is confidence, though, whether a guy has hair or no.  , With thinning hair, you might be better shaving it off. According to one study, men with shaved heads were consistently rated as more masculine and dominant than those who tried to conceal hair loss, in addition to being rated as taller and stronger.By embracing baldness, you might actually appear more rather than less manly and attractive. Concealing thinning hair can be a big turn-off, as the concealment looks desperate and lacking in self-assurance., Try a hair style that shows your thinning hair to best advantage. The general rule is that short is better when it comes to balding men, whether you go crew cut or full cue ball.For one thing, close-cropped hairstyles give your hair a sense of added fullness and lift. They also makes existing bald spots less conspicuous and are much less expensive in the long-run than various concealment or treatments. Shorter lengths like buzz cuts also exude confidence. They say to onlookers, “Yes, I’m balding. So what?”  , The final way to embrace your baldness is to go beyond the close crop and shave everything off. It is conspicuous, it is self-confident, and it is a good option for men with large bald spots.Although you will have to razor your head every now and then, a clean shave on top means that you will never have to bother with washing and styling again. It is the ultimate in low maintenance hair. For many men with the style, the shaved head has become a signature look. Consider Jordan, consider Captain Picard, consider Andre Agassi.  , You can also grow facial hair as a way to offset the loss up top and to direct attention down from your thinning pate. Adding a mustache, beard, or goatee can help to balance your face.   Full goatees work well with thinning hair, for example, as do thick, handlebar mustaches. A full, bushy beard and shaved head is another bold look. If done properly, it can be extremely manly.  ",926,"['loss', 'terms', 'self-consciousness', 'facial hair', 'close-cropped look', 'steps']"

When selecting peaches, look closely at the skin and make sure that the peach is not torn or bruised. The peaches you select should not be firm (a sign of under-ripe fruit) but should gently give if you squeeze slightly.   If applicable, look in your supermarket’s organic section, or visit a nearby organic foods or health-food store. Peaches sold at these locations will likely be healthier and will have been grown under organic conditions.; , If you live in a city or neighborhood that has a frequent farmer’s market, plan to purchase your peaches there. Peaches from a local vendor are likely to have been picked within only a few days, and will have been grown without pesticides.   Farmer’s markets are typically only open during the spring and summer months, roughly from April through September. Look online or ask at a local grocery store to find out if there’s a farmer’s market near you.  , If you’re preparing the recipe in a hurry and don’t have time to prepare whole peaches, or if you are unable to find ripe, fresh, or organic peaches, just grab frozen peaches out of the frozen-foods section at your local grocery store.As with shopping for fresh peaches, look for organic bags of frozen peaches. These will have been prepared without pesticides.  , To begin preparing the peaches for the sauce, you’ll need to wash off any dirt from the fuzzy skin of the peach. (Be sure to leave the skin on however, as it contains both nutrients and flavor.) Then slice the peaches in half, and use your fingers to pry out the peach pit. Finally, cut the peaches in half again, so that you are left with peach quarters.Although this recipe only calls for four peaches, it can easily be doubled or tripled. As long as you’re washing and cutting peaches, consider preparing eight or twelve instead of only four.  , Take your peach quarters, and place them in a large saucepan. Add 1 cup of water, ¼ cup of fresh lemon juice, and 3 cups of granulated sugar. Do not stir the mixture, but cover and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once the mixture is simmering, reduce to a low temperature and allow it to simmer for 30 to 45 minutes.Do not stir the peaches while they’re simmering. Even gentle stirring can smash the peach quarters and break them apart. In order to have relatively well preserved peach pieces, let the mixture simmer unstirred.  , Once your peach syrup has simmered, turn off the burner and remove the saucepan. You’ll need to strain the syrup to separate the syrup itself from the peach quarters. To do this, pour the contents of the saucepan into a fine colander and set this over a large bowl or container. Let the liquid syrup filter out through the colander for about an hour.As the syrup strains, use a wooden spoon to press down on the solid peach material. Press gently: if you exert too much pressure on the peach quarters, they may become damaged and turn the syrup cloudy.  , If the syrup is thinner or runnier than you would like it to be—or if you want to set aside a portion of the syrup and thicken it so that you have syrup of two separate consistencies—you can thicken the syrup using cornstarch. Take a cup of your peach syrup and, using a whisk, blend 1 tablespoon of corn starch into the syrup. Then transfer a mixture to a saucepan and bring to a boil, using the whisk to stir constantly.You can use the color of the syrup to gauge if it has thickened fully. When you’re mixing in the cornstarch at first, the mixture will be cloudy, but after the syrup has boiled for a few minutes, it’ll become clear again.  , The peach pulp itself will still have a strong flavor after simmering and straining, although its consistency will be mushy. You don’t need to throw the pulp away; rather, let it cool and then freeze the pulp in plastic bags or Tupperware containers. The pulp can be combined with other fruits in a smoothie, or added on top of yogurt.If you’d like to even out the consistency of the peach pulp before freezing it, spoon the pulp into a blender and puree it to a uniform consistency.  , Once you have strained the syrup, let it cool down to room temperature; this will take roughly an hour. When the syrup has cooled down, you can pour it into jars, cans, or plastic Tupperware containers and store it in your refrigerator. The fresh peach syrup will keep for about two weeks, so you should plan to consume it all within that period of time.",815,"['jar', 'organic peaches', 'use', 'consistency', 'local farmer', 'frozen peaches', 'market', 'peach pulp', 'syrup', 'local supermarket', 'smoothies', 'cooking', 'refrigerator', '16-ounce packages', 'quarter', 'peaches', 'peach syrup']"
"['gather your materials', 'prepare the embroidery hoop for hanging', 'prepare the seashells for hanging', 'hang the seashells from the embroidery loop', 'display your new seashell wind chimes']",How to Create Seashell Wind Chimes," For this project, you will need 24 shells of relatively uniform size, some string or fishing line, the inner wood hoop from an embroidery hoop, a drill with a small drill bit (1/32 inch or smaller), and a pair of scissors.   This guide will present only 1 possible design for seashell wind chimes. You can adjust and augment these plans as desired to create wind chimes that are bigger, smaller, or have a different appearance. If your seashells were gathered from a beach, it is best to clean them before using. Stray sand, grime, and bacteria can be removed using a mild dish soap and water.; , The wooden hoop will be the piece from which all of the seashells hang. You will need to begin by drilling holes into it for passing the string through.   Place the hoop on a flat surface and use a pencil to mark out 24 evenly spaced points around its circumference. Do this by marking 4 points at the top, bottom, leftmost, and rightmost areas of the hoop. Then add 4 more points at the midpoints between the first 4. Finally, fill each remaining space in with 2 equally spaced points.       Fit your drill with a small drill bit and create 24 holes in the hoop where you marked the points. The holes should be large enough to pass your string or fishing line through.        , Each seashell will also need a hole drilled in it so that the string can be tied around it. The hole can be placed anywhere on the shell, keeping in mind that the position in which the shell hangs will be dictated by the hole's location.   Drill a small hole through each shell using the same size drill bit as before. To help prevent the shell from cracking, you can cover the hole's location with a strip of masking tape before drilling. Remove the tape after making the hole.       Cut your string into 24 separate pieces that are about 12 inches (30 cm) long. Tie one end of each piece of string through the hole in each seashell. Cut off any excess string to neaten the appearance.        , Once all of the shells have been attached to pieces of string, they are ready to hang onto the wooden loop.   Begin by tying the first seashell to a hole in the wooden loop using the full 12 inches (30 cm) of string. Tie the adjacent shell to the loop, this time positioning the knot so that the new shell hangs just higher than its neighbor. Repeat this process for all 24 shells, hanging each one slightly higher than the last. This will create a pleasant cascading appearance.       Once all of the strings are tied to the loop, you can cut off the excess string using your scissors.        , Once all of the seashells are hanging from the embroidery loop, the wind chimes are ready to hang. You can use the same string or fishing line to hang the wooden hoop from a hook. The string can be looped through the same holes used to hang the shells if the holes are wide enough. If not, you can drill 4 new equally spaced holes to suspend the hoop from 4 pieces of string.  ",543,"['new seashell wind', 'embroidery loop', 'seashells', 'embroidery hoop', 'materials']"

Gold is unimportant at the start of the game because in a normal game, gold is not needed at the start. Collect food and use the food for new villagers. About 2/3 of the villagers should be collecting food and 1/3 should be collecting wood in the first Age. Important: Try to collect food from sheep first and don't build fields, they use up too much wood. When you step into the next Age, you should send some villagers to collect gold.; , Your food-collectors should now have killed all the sheep or other animals and you should have enough wood to build a field. Also build a market because you can increase the speed of collecting food, wood and gold. Try now to build as much villagers as possible so you can build more fields and also send more villagers to mines where they can collect gold.  , Build one barrack and build some Infantry just in case the enemy wants to disturb your economy and you can't afford that when the game started. So always have this in mind. Always look for upgrades from your home-town so your villagers can collect everything faster. The faster you get resources the faster you will have an army.  , Try to build up a small army but continue building villagers. Try having many villagers and it really pays off because you will get many resources fast. In the third age you should really watch for upgrading everything and build all the buildings. Upgrade your troops. Now you will need gold. Try to collect as much gold as you can from the gold-mines and not from plantation. Plantation is good but not as fast as gold-mines. So you want to use the mines. (Tips on how to build good gold-outposts you can read in my other guide: ""How to build good outposts for gold-mines in Age of Empires 3"")  , Keep your economy running and don't hesitate to build more villagers. You should have two fields with 10 villagers each, so you won't get out of food. Try having many villagers for collecting wood because you won't get it as fast as the other resources. For gold you can use about 10 to 15 villagers.  , Try to build a real army and keep collecting all the resources. When you realize that there aren't gold-mines anymore, start to build plantation. It's slow but better than nothing. If you have enough wood, use some villagers who are collecting wood to build a new plantation and don't use food to build new villagers. Upgrade everything and build your army (Tips on how to build an army you can find in my guide: ""How to build a good balanced army in Age of Empires 3"").  , Develop everything in the church and in the smith because there are really good upgrades that will help your military.  , Mostly in the ""war-time"" you will have some gold problems because cannons and such cost so much gold. So focus on gold with plantation and factories. If you have enough food, try to use the villagers from the fields/mills to collect gold in plantations.  , You need the resources so don't just watch at the numbers, use them! You can always build troops or something that you need. Keep practicing and arrange the resources depending upon situation. Sometimes you have to build military because the enemy is attacking you. But if your economy is good, you gain resources fast and can push the enemy back and attack him after.

Traditionally, couples changed into clothes for the plane ride before their big exit. In addition to the dramatic appeal of a costume change, newlyweds often change into outfits that are more suited to drinking, eating, and dancing., Your designated helper should quietly let you know when your exit time is approaching. This will give you a few minutes to give out hugs and personal goodbyes before your grand exit.Alternatively, they can let you know that people are getting tired, talking about leaving or having to get up early in the morning, and other reasons that would justify bumping up the exit time.  , Be sure that your limousine, cab, horse and carriage, or whatever means of transportation you’ve chosen is in position to pick you up after your exit. Have your emcee or stage manager give a signal to your driver to bring the car around or call a cab. Make sure this is done just before the five minute warning, or even earlier if necessary., Have the emcee or DJ make an announcement just before the last dance. They should offer instructions both before and after the dance.Have them say, “Good evening everyone! We’re about to have our last dance of the night. Immediately after, we’ll be sending off the newlyweds into married life! Please make your way to the front steps at the end of the song.” Have them tell guests whether they’ll be throwing or waving anything at the send-off. After the song, have the emcee or DJ once again instruct guests to make their way to the exit area. Have your wedding party or other helpers hand out rice, confetti, white clothes, sparklers, or any other items that are part of your grand exit.  , While you make the most of your party, have your stage manager, wedding party, or other designated helpers keep an eye on the the crowd. Have them keep track of the tone, if guests are talking about leaving soon, and other causes to tweak your schedule. Proceed with any festivities left on the schedule, and have your helpers begin to prepare the send-off.Have them report to you if they hear that important guests or a significant number of people mention getting back to the babysitter, having to get up early for work, or other reasons for leaving soon. Your designated helpers should tell them, ""Don't worry, stick around a bit. The newlyweds will be making their exit soon."" Then, they should report to you and ask if you're ready to start to wind things down. They should also keep an eye out for rowdy guests. If too many people have taken advantage of the bar, they should ask the bartender about cutting people off, politely handle any issues, and inform you that it might be time for people to move on to the bars if they wish to continue the party. Both you and the venue should help arrange any necessary transportation to prevent your guests from drinking and driving. Remember that you've most likely rented out your venue for a specific amount of time, so try not to cut festivities too short unless it's necessary. If you still have two hours of rental time left, it might be better to take full advantage of your investment rather than worry about having a maximum number of guests send you off.

Avoid asparagus with open or seedy tips.; , Wilted or limp asparagus is most likely old or has been mishandled.  , Stalks should be round, not flat or ridged.  , Choose another bunch if the ends are woody or they appear dry.  , Fresh asparagus will be odorless.  , Younger asparagus will have thinner stalks that don't require peeling. Sometimes more mature asparagus with thick stalks requires special preparation.  , Don't wash before storing as it hastens decay.  ,, You can wrap the ends of the stalks in a wet paper towel and place in a plastic bag to help keep your vegetables fresh.  , Grab a stalk and apply pressure at the bottom. It will naturally snap where the woody part ends. Alternately, you can lay out the asparagus in your bunch and cut all ends to the same length.  , You can cook young asparagus without peeling it, but more mature stalks may require peeling.   Use a paring knife or vegetable peeler to slice off the stiff outer layer of the stalk. A paring knife will allow you more control. The tough skin will be thicker at the bottom of the stalk and become thinner as you reach the tip.  , You want to cook stalks of approximately the same size together. If you mix different sizes, they may not cook evenly.  ,   Tie your asparagus into a bundle using cooking twine. Gather 6 to 8 stalks and place a 30 inch (76.2 cm) piece of twine under the bundle and cross each half of the twine over to the opposite side. Continue wrapping the twine and tie off at the end of the stalks. Make sure to start wrapping below the tips. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add asparagus. Wait until the water comes back to a boil and start timing-asparagus should cook in 5 to 8 minutes.  , Tying your asparagus in a bundle is also a good practice when you steam it as it protects the fragile tips from breakage. Steam approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  ,   Heat oven to 450 to 500 degrees F (232.3 to 260 degrees C). Brush a cookie sheet or other pan with olive oil or use a vegetable oil spray. Lay asparagus out on the pan. Brush vegetables with oil, or spray again with vegetable oil. Add salt, pepper, or other seasonings and cook 15 to 20 minutes, or until spears are slightly browned.  ,   Coat asparagus with oil. Use direct, medium heat when you cook asparagus over the grill. You can either place the spears directly on the grill or use a grill basket or skillet to help protect the tender tips. Grill approximately 6 minutes.  ,   Place asparagus in a microwave save bowl or container. For 1 lb. (.45 kg) asparagus, add 1/4 cup (59 ml) of water. Cover with plastic wrap. Cook at full power for 4 to 7 minutes for asparagus spears and 3 to 5 minutes for cut pieces. Turn asparagus halfway through the cooking time.  ,   Cut asparagus into 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) pieces.

As many community members as possible should be involved in the process. Nobody should be excluded or left out (unless they ask to be excluded).       Participation. Not only is every person included, but each and every person is also expected to participate by contributing opinions and suggestions. While there are various roles that others may have, each person has an equal share (and stake) in the final decision.       Co-operation. All the people involved collaborate and build upon each other's concerns and suggestions to come up with a decision or solution that will satisfy everyone in the group, rather than just the majority (while the minority is ignored).       Egalitarianism. Nobody's input is weighed more or less than anyone else's. Each has equal opportunity to amend, veto, or block ideas.       Solution-mindedness. An effective decision-making body works towards a common solution, despite differences. This comes through collaboratively shaping a proposal until it meets as many of the participants' concerns as possible.      ; , Consensus decision making involves a collaborative discussion, rather than an adversarial debate. Thus a consensus process is more likely to result in all parties reaching common ground. The benefits include:   Better decisions- because all perspectives in the group are taken into account. The resulting proposals are therefore able to address all the concerns affecting the decision as much as possible.       Better group relationships- through collaborating rather than competing, group members are able to build closer relationships through the process. Resentment and rivalry between winners and losers is minimized.       Better implementation of decisions- When widespread agreement is achieved and everyone has participated in the process there is usually strong levels of cooperation in follow through. There are not likely to be disgruntled losers who might undermine or passively sabotage effective implementation of the group's decision.        , A consensus process allows a group to generate as much agreement as possible. Some groups require everyone to consent if a proposal is to be passed. Other groups, however, allow decisions to be finalized without unanimous consent. Often a super-majority is deemed sufficient. Some groups use a simple majority vote or the judgment of a leader. They can still use a consensus process to come up with their proposals, regardless of how they finalize a decision.  , Consenting to a proposal does not necessarily mean it is your first choice. Participants are encouraged to think about the good of the whole group. This may mean accepting a popular proposal even if it is not your personal preference. In consensus decision making participants voice their concerns during the discussion so that their ideas can be included. In the end, however, they often decide to accept the best effort of the group rather than create factions or an ""us against them"" mentality.  , You may need to add something or take something away. You may need to start something new or amend something current. Whatever it is, make sure that the entire issue is clearly stated for everyone to understand. It's always a good idea to address why the issue is being raised in the first place (i.e. what is the problem that needs to be solved?). Briefly review the options that are available.  , This sets the groundwork for collaboratively developing a proposal that most people will support.  , Before attempting a lengthy discussion, take a straw polls to see how much support a proposal idea has. If everyone agrees on a position, move on to finalizing and implementing the decision. If there is disagreement, discuss the concerns that are not yet met by the proposal. Then adapt the proposal, if possible, to make it more broadly agreeable. Sometimes a solution is reached by finding a middle ground between all parties. Even better,however, is when a proposal is shaped to meet as many needs as possible (win-win) rather than through compromise. Remember, to listen to each and every dissenter in the effort to get full agreement.  , After a strong attempt has been made to get full agreement, poll the group to find out if the support in the group is sufficient to pass the proposal. The threshold of support necessary depends on the group's choice of decision rule. The decision rule used by your group should be decided well in advance of any contentious proposal being brought before it for consensus-building. There are several options:   Required Unanimity One Dissenter (also called U-1, or Unanimity minus one) means that all participants support the decision except for one. The individual dissenter usually can't block the decision, but may be able to prolong debate (like the infamous filibuster). Due to their skepticism of the decision, the lone dissenter makes a very good evaluator of the outcome of the decision because they can view it with a critical eye and spot negative consequences before others would. Two Dissenters (U-2 or Unanimity minus two) also can't block a decision, but they are more effective at prolonging debate and obtaining a third dissenter (in which case a decision usually can be blocked) if they agree on what is wrong with the proposal. Three Dissenters (U-3 or Unanimity minus three), is recognized by most groups as enough to constitute non-consensus, but this can vary between decision-making bodies (especially if it is a small group). Rough Consensus doesn't specifically define ""how much is enough"". The working group leader or even the group itself must decide when a consensus has been reached (although this can create additional disagreement when consensus cannot be reached about coming to a consensus). This places increased responsibility on the leader and can stir further debate if the leader's judgment is questioned. Super-majority (can range from 55% to 90%) Simple Majority Referred to a committee or leader for final ruling.  ,",959,"['consensus process', 'consensus decision', 'consent', 'concerns participants', 'waters', 'benefits', 'decision', 'group', 'proposal', 'final decision rule', 'address', 'principles']"

This will take the chill off of the meat and make it cook evenly., Sprinkle one side of the steak with salt and coarsely ground pepper. Avoid pushing the salt and pepper into the steak since you want to avoid over handling the beef., Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of extra-virgin sesame seed oil into a cast iron or large skillet. Turn the heat on to medium-high and heat the oil for about 30 seconds. Slice 2 large cloves of garlic and add them to the oil. Heat the garlic in the oil for about 30 seconds.The garlic will flavor the neutral-tasting sesame oil. Avoid using toasted sesame oil because it will have a strong nutty flavor.  , While you may be tempted to marinate your Wagyu steak, the meat really doesn't need it. Marinating the Wagyu beef in acidic ingredients can toughen the meat and hide its rich flavor.Remember that you can always season the Wagyu beef steaks once they've finished cooking.  , Hold one end of the Wagyu beef with one hand and use chopsticks to lift the other end. Carefully lay the beef seasoned side down in the heated skillet.Avoid over handling or stretching the steak because it will make the meat tough.  , Sprinkle more salt and coarsely ground pepper over the top of the steak in the skillet. This should be the side that you didn't season earlier., Leave the beef in the skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute. This will give it a chance to brown a bit. If your steak is over 1/2 to 3/4-inch (12 to 19 mm) thick, you may need to cook it another minute.You should see liquid appear on the top of the steak after it's seared for a minute.  , Use a wooden spatula and chopsticks to gently flip the steak over. Cook the steak for another minute or two. You should see both sides become browned, but the inside will be pink., Once the Wagyu beef has reached medium-rare, carefully lift it out of the skillet using a wooden spatula. Avoid using tongs to pull the steak out of the skillet since this could stretch the beef., Let the beef rest for 5 minutes. The steak will continue to cook a little as it rests. Insert an instant read thermometer into the thickest part of the steak. For medium-rare, the beef should reach 145 degrees F (60 degrees C).To keep the delicate flavor and texture of the Wagyu beef, don't cook the steak past medium-rare.  , Use a spoon or ladle to scoop up any pan juices left in the skillet. Pour these over the Wagyu beef to give it extra flavor. Sprinkle a little extra salt and pepper over the beef and slice it into strips., While you can serve the Wagyu beef as simple strips, consider making white rice to go with the meat. You can also arrange flavorful garnishes that will enhance the richness of the beef.

"['check for indicators of an infection', 'consider how long you have been experiencing symptoms', 'avoid changes in external stimuli', 'consult with your doctor', 'consult an ent specialist']",How to Treat Nasal Infection Naturally4," Sinusitis can be hard to diagnose, especially since the symptoms are similar to that of a cold. Acute sinusitis often occurs after you have a cold, and symptoms get worse after 5-7 days. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis are usually a bit milder, but last much longer. Common symptoms of sinusitis include:Headache and fever Pressure in the forehead, temples, cheeks, nose, jaw, teeth, behind the eyes, or at the top of the head Facial tenderness or swelling, especially around the eyes or cheeks Nasal stuffiness, loss of smell Nasal discharge (usually yellowish green) or post-nasal drip (feeling a sensation of fluid dripping down the back of your throat) Cough and sore throat Bad breath Fatigue  , Sinusitis can be acute (lasting less than 4 weeks) or chronic (lasting longer than 12 weeks).Acute sinusitis has many causes, but viral infection is the most common culprit, causing 90-98% of cases.This type of acute sinusitis will usually get better within 7-14 days. Chronic sinusitis also has several causes, but allergies are the most common. You may also be more likely to have chronic sinusitis if you smoke or have asthma.  , Sinusitis is common during seasonal changes that may trigger colds or allergies. Changes in your environment or hazardous chemicals or particulate in the air may also trigger sinusitis.Allergens such as pollen or dust are common causes of sinusitis. Cigarette smoke and hazardous fumes irritate nasal tissue, which can cause sinusitis. Changes in pressure, such as when you scuba dive, fly, or climb high altitudes, can cause sinusitis. Extreme temperatures or sudden changes in temperature can also cause sinusitis.  , Some cases of sinusitis may be caused by bacterial infections. These types of sinusitis may be more severe and may need to be treated by antibiotics. Because the symptoms of bacterial, viral, and allergic sinusitis are similar, it’s important to see a doctor so s/he can diagnose and treat you properly.Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. Also tell your doctor if you recently had any surgery related to dental problems or physical injuries. Seek professional help immediately if you have a high fever (above 104F) or are experiencing shortness of breath. These could be signs of a more serious condition. Rare complications associated with chronic sinusitis include blood clots, abscesses, meningitis, orbital cellulitis, and osteomyelitis, an infection that spreads to the bones in the face. Do not take antibiotics for sinusitis unless your doctor has prescribed them. Only 2-10% of sinusitis cases are caused by bacterial infections. Antibiotics will only treat bacterial sinusitis. It will not help other types.Using antibiotics when you don’t need them can increase your risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections.If your symptoms have lasted longer than 8 weeks, your doctor may request imaging tests, such as an x-ray, CT scan, or MRI. Your doctor may also order an allergy test to determine whether allergies are causing your sinusitis.  , If your symptoms last longer than 8 weeks, your doctor may refer you to an otolaryngologist (Ear-Nose-Throat, or ENT doctor). An ENT specialist can perform a nasal endoscopy using a fiber optic scope to examine your sinuses.   In some cases, your ENT doctor may suggest an endoscopic sinus surgery. This can help remove structural blockage from a deviated septum or polyp, damaged or swollen tissue, or other problems causing your sinusitis.",550,"['symptoms', 'ent specialist', 'infection', 'external stimuli', 'doctor', 'indicators', 'changes']"

Although pony beads are classic for making a traditional kandi cuff, you can use any type of beads as long as the hole is large enough to fit your string through twice.; , Depending on how large your wrist is and how wide you want your cuff to be, you will have to use varying amounts of string. Wrap the string around your wrist to get a general measurement, and then multiply this length 5-6 times over. Cut the string at this length; if you run out of string during the beading process, you can always cut and tie on a bit more.  , Tie a knot at the end of your string (leaving a small tail), and begin sliding on beads. Using about 25-30 beads is standard, but you'll just want enough so that the cuff will be big enough to slide on and off your wrist without being too loose.  , Pull the string and beads taut so that they are all lined up tight against the knot at the end of the string. Tie the short knotted end with the long loose end in a secure knot. Cut off the excess string from the short end, but leave the long end of the string intact..  , The second row is a bit slower-going than the first, because the process involves adding a single bead and then weaving the string through the previous row. To bead the second row, string one bead on the long end of the string, and then slide the string through the bead directly under and next to the bead you’re working with. Add another bead, and slide the string through the bead next/under it on the first row. Continue this process all the way around, until you reach your starting point.Add one bead to the string, then thread the string over the first bead and through the second bead of the first row. This is how you weave the rows together.   Because you’re skipping beads in the first row in order to weave the second row, your cuff will appear zig-zag with only two rows completed.  , Use the same process for adding the second row of beads to add the third row of beads. This time, you don’t need to tie the string off in a knot but can continue the process by adding beads to fill in the spaces. Slide a bead onto the string where there is a gap, and then attach it to the cuff by putting the string through the corresponding bead in the first row. Work your way all the way around the bracelet until you’ve created two full rows of beads, and tie off the string.  , Although you can technically have a complete cuff with only two rows of beads, many people prefer to add multiple rows in addition to the first two. Use the aforementioned method of weaving on beads to create an uneven row, and then adding another row to fill in the spaces.  , When you feel that your kandi cuff has been perfected, tie off the string and try it on for size! If at any point in the bracelet-making process you run out of string, you can cut an additional length and tie it to the ends, trimming off any excess to create a smooth transition.",579,"['bracelet', 'second row', 'string', 'beads', 'additional rows', 'right materials', 'first row', 'third row']"

This could be interpreted in as many ways as you like.   Beware any advice that proscribes the colors, the styles, and the exact brands you must wear to be sporty. This is confining and is simply someone's opinion. Equally, all the advice offered here is just that––advice, and you are in charge of picking and rejecting whatever you prefer from it.  , For example, a sweatsuit with a label on it, a shapely tennis dress, cute tennis shoes, and a matching headband.  , This might include dangling items, fiddly things such as sequins that take forever to wash, and high heels. Of course, special occasions are an exemption, and you can wear the more finicky things for those.   Baggy clothing doesn't come across as very sporty. Pink is fine. Colors are totally your choice.  , Sporty girls don't like to be restricted when moving, so choose fabrics and style cuts that allow for full movement, stretching, and running.  , Stuck for ideas? Here are some ideas other readers have suggested:   Pick a team jersey. Pair sporty pants with it. Fitted shorts like Soffe, paired with a tee-shirt/Old Team jersey. Try baggier basketball shorts with a fitted graphic tee/fitted tank top. If it's colder out, try jeans/yoga pants/sweat pants with a graphic tee, or printed shirt. Hoodies make a good addition. Get autographed t-shirts and caps by team players.  , Shoes should support your feet well, sporty or not. If you like to run, choose runners. If you like a variety of activities, choose cross-trainers. If you like the beach, choose sand shoes, flip flops, or sandals. Other suggestions from readers include:   Cleats for sports. Regular sneakers in a variety of colors; remember, black goes with everything, white stains very easily. Brand shoes, if that's your thing. Athletic sneakers.  , Sporty girls visit the pool to swim, not play or lie around tanning. Get a one piece that is meant for proper swimming.  , For example, wear a messy, bumpy ponytail secured with rainbow elastics. For a good impression, let your hair down once every six months and straighten it. You'll get tons of compliments on your hair.   A simple ponytail with a headband is an easy and fresh look for the sporty girl.  , Sometimes fun nails are okay, but no French manicures or other nail art that will hamper your activities. But crazy stuff like lime green and navy blue on your toes, then purple and orange on your fingers are cute and playful, provided you don't mind constant retouches.  , You can practice sporty things together. However, don't neglect your other side either; a few musical, intellectual, and dramatic friends are a good choice for the friendship mix too.  , Good friends will accommodate your new sporty lifestyle, maybe even embrace it themselves.  , This helps your body to sweat more efficiently, to stay energized and to ensure that you don't overheat.  , Eat plenty of good, unprocessed foods suitable to your body type. See a dietitian or nutritionist if you don't know how to eat optimally; or talk to a teacher who specializes in health studies or your parents for more ideas.  , If you get injured, in any way, make sure to take at least a day's rest, or you could hurt yourself more.

Windows 7 also doesn't have these issues. Windows Vista (7) also includes many features that enhance productivity, including instant desktop search, and features improvements in security.; , If you have any pictures or documents you want to keep, or programs that are hard to find, write them to a USB flash drive, external hard disk, or CD or DVD. Do this because everything on your hard disk will be destroyed during the process of installing Windows XP. Also make a set of Windows Vista recovery DVDs to ensure that you can return to Windows Vista if Windows XP doesn't work on your new computer. The exact location of the program to do so differs depending on the brand of your computer, but usually there is a reminder pop-up that periodically appears at the lower right corner if you have not made the discs yet.  , This is necessary because these drivers add support for newer hardware that did not exist when Windows XP was released. Save the drivers onto your backup disk (along with your personal files). Make sure you get the drivers for ""Ethernet"" and ""Wireless"". Otherwise, you might not be able to connect to the Internet to download others. And if you use a wireless network with WPA2 security (or if you're not sure), also download the Wireless Client Update and save it to the backup disk. Also find the driver discs for all printers, scanners, PDAs, music players, and wireless network adapters you will use with the new computer. Some of these drivers might be available from the manufacturer's website if you have lost your CD's.  , Put in the CD and then restart your computer. Wait for the setup files to finish loading. If the computer starts into Windows Vista instead of Windows XP Setup, you may have to press a key to boot from the CD. Restart your computer and press the key for the boot menu. This key is different for every computer depending on the BIOS.  , Press ENTER and then press F8 to accept the license agreement. If the setup program asks you for the disc for a previous version of Windows, insert a Windows 98 or Windows Me disc and press ENTER. Then switch back to the Windows XP disc. This is perfectly acceptable as long as you are not using that copy of Windows 98/Me. ,, Then wait for the files to copy. When the Setup program asks for a Product Key, get the folder that your Windows XP CD was in and look at the yellow label on the back. The ID number printed on it is what it wants. Type it in accurately. If Setup says that the code is invalid, carefully check your typing against the label and try again. If, however, Setup does not detect your hard disk, check your computer's BIOS settings and change any ""AHCI"" or ""RAID"" setting to ""IDE"". (Change it back if you want to go back to Windows Vista.) If there's no such setting, you're out of luck and will have to continue to use Windows Vista. (In this case, just remove the CD and reboot; no files were erased.)  , Before running Windows Update, install the WPA update (if needed), and the drivers you downloaded before installing Windows XP.  , To save time, remember to activate Windows first. When updating your computer, you will need a high-speed Internet connection, and several reboots will be required as Service Pack 3 and other updates are installed; after each reboot, you should run Windows Update again until there are no more updates.  , Download and install any drivers you need that you have not already installed. Get the software programs you want and reinstall them, and put back your pictures, documents, and other files you saved. Then install an anti-virus program, such as AVG Anti-Virus (free for personal use) or Microsoft Security Essentials (free for all Windows users).

"['choose a rabbit trap', 'pick a location for your trap', 'place bait in trap', 'set your trap', 'check your trap often', 'be careful in handling the rabbit']",How to Trap a Rabbit1," These live rabbit traps consist of a cage with a trigger plate forces the door of the trap closed once the rabbit triggers the plate by entering into the cage. You can choose between one door or two door traps, but you'll want a trap that is 22 to 30 inches in length. You can often purchase these online or at an animal feed or hardware store or make your own rabbit trap. Havahart is a popular brand for rabbit traps.The one and door two traps are both effective traps, but have different benefits. The one door trap is favored by professional trappers and it allows you to place the rabbit bate behind the trigger plate, which lures the rabbit further into the cage. The two door trap allows the rabbit to enter the cage from both directions, thus providing a higher catch rate for rabbits. Rabbits will also become nervous or fearful once in the trap, but having a two door trap allows the rabbit to see through the trap, which can be comforting for the rabbit. The two door trap can also be set as a one door trap if desired.; , Determine where you have the most rabbit activity and place a trap along that area. Rabbits don't often cross stretches of land, so avoid placing a trap in an area that would require the rabbit to be vulnerable. You'll want to place your trap on a flat surface, placing a small weight on top of the trap so that other animals cannot tip it over to reach the bait.   Rabbits are often in areas where they have cover and open land. Common areas rabbits are located are hedges, shrubs, trees, fence lines, tall grass, wood and brush piles, bushes, and tree lines. These are the locations you'll likely have the most success in catching a rabbit. If you are able to locate a rabbit's den or warren (rabbit hole), then place the trap a few feet from the entrance. You can often locate areas where rabbits have been by their droppings, which are dry, round pellets.  , Choose a bait that is likely to attract rabbits and place bait behind trigger plate. In the winter, dried foods are better because they are less likely to freeze and in the summer, when food is abundant for rabbits, choosing richer fruits or vegetables, like apples and carrots, will be more effective in trapping a rabbit.   If you are using a one door trap, place bait at the end of the cage, behind the trap opening. If you are using a two door trap, place bait between the two doors, in the center of the trap. Some baits to use for rabbits are fruits and vegetables like apple cores, bananas, potato peelings, lettuce leafs, raw cabbage, carrots, dandelions, and leafy weeds. If you find traditional baits aren't producing success, you can try using baits that are more unusual. Some ideas for these types of baits are cheesy biscuits crumbled up and peanut butter. Rabbits may be able to smell your scent on the trap and will avoid the trap because they feel that something is wrong. To cover up your scent, drip or spray apple cider onto the trap., Now that you have placed your bait, it's time to set your trap. Follow the trap's instructions explaining how to set your trap. After you have set your trap, you'll want to check the trigger to make sure it is working properly. Gently press down on the trip plate, and the doors should immediately snap closed.If the rabbit you are trying to trap is on the smaller side, they may not be able to trip the trigger, so place a small weight on the trigger plate so that the combined weight of the two will be enough to make the trap effective. It could also be good to camouflage your trap with twigs and leaves, because a metal trap can produce a glare in the sun, causing the rabbit to avoid it.  , After you have set your trap, you'll want to check it often to see if you have caught a rabbit. If a rabbit is caught and you neglect your trap, the rabbit can quickly become malnourished, so you want to check the trap daily to prevent harming the rabbit.   Keep in mind you may accidentally trap other animals in your trap. Raccoons are often lured into rabbit traps as well as other animals, so if you catch another animal release it immediately. You may find that you are not having much success with your trap if you are trying to catch a rabbit in the summer. That's because during the summer, rabbits often have a much higher supply of food and nutrients available to them. The best time to trap a rabbit is in the winter, when food is more scarce and the rabbit will be in search of food.  , If you have checked your trap and found a rabbit in it, be careful when removing the rabbit as it is probably scared and may bite you. Consider wearing gloves when removing the rabbit to prevent disease from spreading if it bites you, and approach it cautiously to prevent from frightening it even further.If you have caught a rabbit in hopes to keep it from destroying your garden or flowerbeds, then relocate the rabbit at least five miles away, if local law permits. Try placing the rabbit in a covered area, for extra protection.  ",918,"['place bait', 'location', 'rabbit trap', 'trap', 'rabbit']"

Swing so that you're able to feel the movement in your hips.   While your upper body should be limber throughout the movement, keep your feet and legs relatively stable.; , The most common mistake beginners make is to hit up. Rather, the first part of a successful chip swing will aim down, only moving up once the club makes contact with the ball.  , Both the downward swing and upward scoop should be accomplished in a single, fluid motion.   When you become more experienced with chipping, you may control the chipping force to accommodate the distance you want the ball to sail.  , A proper chip won't end with the ball's impact. In order to maximize your force, you should see the swing through, leaving your club back up in the air. Complete the swing in the same fluid motion you started with.  , After a chip, the ball should fly a short distance and proceed to roll. As with any golf shot, you should keep your eye on where the ball lands. Keeping an eye on the ball is important during practice, as well. It can teach you how much force you need with each club to go a given distance.  , Chipping the ball is a more strategic move than a regular golf shot. It is meant to get your ball out of a tricky situation, such as if you're caught in the grass or trying to navigate past a hill. Chipping the golf ball should not be used in instances where a normal shot can easily be employed.   This rule doesn't apply if you're trying to learn the shot. If anything, you should practice the basics of chipping on a smooth surface before you move on to its usual application.  , Because chip shots are used to get your ball out of the grass and back on course, you can estimate the distance from the grassed ball to the green, plus the distance you want the ball to go on the green. You can measure the distances by using footsteps. For instance, if your ball is five steps away from the green and the hole is ten steps following that, you will have a 1-to-2 ratio.   A sand wedge is good for a 1-to-1 ratio from the grass to the green. A pitching wedge is good for a 1-to-2 ratio. A 9-iron is a 1-to-3 ratio.  , Because chipping the ball successfully requires so much control, make sure your hands are placed properly on the club before you attempt to chip the ball.  , You should aim your body slightly ahead of the ball, with your sternum drawing a parallel line with the location of the ball.   The sternum refers to the middle of one's chest.  , Arching your chest will result in a skewed chip because it will change direction of the club. If you're having any difficulty with achieving a proper stance, get someone else to watch you.  , There should be a space between your feet roughly equivalent to one of your feet. Your feet should be parallel with one another, both aimed directly forward.  , Letting your hip on the other side of the club move around will take some of the stress off your wrists.  , Although some golf instructors can be quite pricey (ranging upwards of 100 USD per hour), getting a few lessons in will help you to unlearn bad habits you may have picked up on your own.  , If you swing too far or change your back position, the back of the club will clip you in the back. This slightly painful reprimand will remind you that you're doing it wrong.   Holding a pool stick alongside the club also works in lieu of a long club.  , With a ""phantom swing,"" you will execute the swing, stopping right before the ball itself. This movement will allow you to practice the motion of chipping a ball without having to retrieve the ball each time you go through with it.  , As with any skill, you need to commit to regular practice in order to polish your chipping technique. You should try to golf at least once a week, and when you do, include chipping as part of the skills you practice. Once you figure out the foundation, you can treat it as you would any other skill.  , Experiment with different footings, swings, and warm-ups. Although it's important to have a firm learning foundation in place before getting creative, it should be seen as a natural part of the learning process to find your own style.

However, you can use larger splashes of metallics to make a bolder statement. Keep in mind that your decor will have a more dramatic look, though, so a heavy dose of metallics is more suited for a formal or evening wedding.If you want to go heavy with metallics in your decorations, it’s best to pair them with a neutral color palette. A subdued color scheme allows the metallics to pop and keeps the decor from being over the top. Pair a large number of metallic decorations with white, black, gray, navy, beige, taupe, and/or brown shades.; , When you’re using metallic decorations for your wedding, it’s important to make sure that they coordinate with the color palette that you’ve chosen. Warm shades, such as reds, oranges, and yellows, usually look best with gold metallic decorations, while cool shades, such blues, greens, and purples, typically work best with silver metallic decorations.Bronze, copper, and rose gold metallic decorations can also complement a warm color palette. Stainless steel or aluminum decorations can also complement a cool color palette.  , If you’re planning to use metallic decorations at your wedding, think about the fabrics and materials that you’ll be pairing with them. To keep the metallics from looking too harsh, choose soft or rich fabrics to help create balance in the decor.For example, you might line the walls of the venue with gauzy curtains or fabrics panels and pair them with metallic accents. Velvet tablecloths paired with metallic centerpieces can work well for a winter wedding. Lace and satin decor can also help soften the look of metallic decorations.  , If you want to add a subtle metallic touch to your wedding decor, consider using metallic vases for your floral arrangements. Pair gold, silver, bronze, or copper vases with simple white or pale pink, yellow, or blue flowers to dress up the tables at your wedding.You can purchase or rent metallic vases for the big day. However, if you’re on a budget, you can make them yourself. Use metallic spray paint to paint inexpensive vases, mason jars, wine bottles, or other glass items that would work as vases.  , If you’re adorning the pews or aisle markers at the wedding venue with flowers, you can work metallics into those arrangements as well. Use metallic ribbon to hold the flowers together for another subtle pop of gold, silver, bronze, or copper. For a more dramatic look, tie the ribbon off in large bows so it really stands out amongst the flowers.You can also use metallic ribbon for the bouquets for the bride and bridesmaids. The groom and groomsmen can also incorporate metallic ribbon in their boutonnieres.  , For a subtle but unique metallic touch to your wedding’s floral arrangements, consider gilding some of the leaves. You can do it yourself or ask your florist to do it for you, but be sure to use camellia and/or magnolia leaves. They last for several days, so you can prepare the leaves ahead of time and have them ready for the wedding.To gild the leaves yourself, use a paintbrush to spread sizing glue, which is available at the craft store, on the tips of the leaves. Next, apply gold, silver, or bronze leaf to the leaves to give them a metallic edge.  , If you want to make a bold statement with metallics at your wedding, metallic sequined table cloths or seat covers can instantly brighten up the venue. You can also save the metallic sequins for just the happy couple’s chairs so they really stand out in the room.If all over sequins seem too much, look for table cloths or chair covers that feature a sequined polka dot design. It will still add shine to the venue without seeming over the top.  , Having candles as part of the table decor at your wedding helps create soft, romantic mood lighting. They also allow you to incorporate metallics into the tablescape by using gold, silver, bronze, or copper candlesticks to hold the candles.Create a striking tablescape by using candlesticks of various heights and widths.  , Silverware may be the traditional option for cutlery, but you can really dress up the place settings for your wedding by using gold instead. You can also mix up your place settings by using bronze or rose gold cutlery, which offers a softer look than gold.You’ll likely need to speak to the venue where you’re having the reception to discuss cutlery options. The venue may not have gold or other metallic cutlery available, so you’ll need to rent them from a party rental company.  , The cake is often the centerpiece of wedding decor, so don’t overlook the possibility of giving it a metallic edge. With edible gold or silver leaf, you can add a metallic layer to the cake -- or cover its entire exterior with a metallic finish so it really stands out.You can also use the metallic gold or silver leaf on fruit and other small pastries to dress up the dessert table.  , Lighting is often a concern at outdoor weddings, but it also presents an opportunity to work in some metallic accents to the decor. Use brass, bronze, or stainless steel lanterns to add light and ambiance to your outdoor wedding.You may even want to use some metallic lanterns at an indoor wedding to highlight certain areas. For example, hang one or more over the table where the happy couple is sitting to help draw attention to them.  , The guest or place cards are another opportunity to incorporate a subtle metallic touch to the decor. Use metallic font for your guests’ names an elegant bit of shine to the decor.To keep a theme throughout the wedding, you might use the same metallic font for the invitations.

The laws for recycling can vary from place to place. While you may be aware of the standard recycling practices of your area, you should still check to see which materials are acceptable to be recycled with regular items like cardboard and plastic bottles.Many beauty products are made from plastics that are harder to recycle and are not accepted in some cities.; , Check each of your items for a small triangle with a stamped number. This number refers to the type of plastic the product is made of and how it can be recycled. For example, while numbers one, two, four, and five are considered safe and can usually be placed outside with normal curbside recycling, numbers three, six, and seven are harder plastics and may require specialized recycling.Keep in mind that some smaller beauty products may not have a number indicating what plastic they’re made from. For these items, look the product up online. For example, if it's a Clinique product, go to the Clinique website and search for the item to see details regarding it.  , Once you’ve researched what’s acceptable in your area, start going through and cleaning your leftover products. Take apart spray bottles by removing the cap, and separating the tops, springs, and bottles. Try to clean out any leftover residue, as well. Rinse each product in warm water and dish soap, scrubbing with a kitchen sponge if necessary.   You can also soak bottles or makeup pots overnight.  , Generally, cardboard, glass containers, metal lids or caps, plastic bottles (one, two, and six) and steel/tin cans can be recycled with regular curbside recycling. However, for empty Aerosol cans, bottle caps, and three, four, five, and seven, plastics you will need to check with your local recycling. Also, if your product has a mirror, try to reuse it rather than tossing it away. For plastic wrap and waxed cardboard, place them into the trash to be taken to a landfill.If you have your own compost, any corn-based plastic can be thrown there.  , Once you’ve checked which plastics are accepted with your local recycling, you can place those items out with the rest of your recyclables. Depending on your area, you may be provided a blue bin or garbage can for recycling that will be picked up once a week. This may be with your usual garbage collection or on an entirely different day. You can also take your recycling directly to a local recycling facility in your area.  , For items that you aren’t sure on, for example, the ones without a number indicating the plastic used, try shipping to Terracycle. This is Garnier’s Personal Care and Beauty Recycling Program. All you need to do is clean up your used beauty products, put them into a box, and then go to the Terracycle website. From the site you can print out a free shipping label to attach to your package. Some areas even have local Terracycle collection facilities., Similar to Garnier, Estee Lauder also offers a place to turn in used beauty products. You can search locally for an Origins store in your area, or you can go the Estee Lauder counter in a department store to turn in your recyclables. They are willing to accept all cosmetic containers, even the ones you feel aren’t able to be recycled. Just make sure you have cleaned everything properly before you turn it in., For the thicker, harder to recycle plastic like the caps of makeup pumps or plastic soda bottles, try turning them into Aveda’s Full Circle recycling program. You can find these locations at any of the Aveda retail stores across the U.S. Simply pack your cleaned items into a box or bag and turn them in over the counter., If you commonly use MAC products, hold onto your empty items until you get six. The type of makeup product doesn’t matter, it can be an eyeshadow palette, a paint pot, lipstick, or primer. Once you have six empty ones, go to any MAC store or counter in a department store and turn them in for a free makeup product like a lipstick., If you've come down to the end of your lipstick, try reviving it by mixing it with another color. Simply take both lipstick stubs and place them into a large metal spoon. Then hold that spoon over an open flame until the lipsticks melt. Stir the mixture with a knife and then pour it into an empty lipstick tube. Place the new lipstick into the refrigerator to harden overnight.You can also take an old lipstick and turn it into a lip-gloss. All you need to do is mix the leftover lipstick with an equal amount of petroleum jelly.  , Take an old solid foundation or powder compact and remove any leftover makeup. Once clean, glue a small piece of felt or a sponge into the open area. Once dry, place a needle or two into the felt/sponge along with some thread. You can also store buttons in the compact if you have room., If you have a multitude of old beauty products with mirrors, use them to create a unique piece of art. For example, use small, circular mirrors to create a larger mirror. You can do this by separating the mirrors and spray painting their backs the same color. Then, simply organize the mirrors into a pattern and glue them to a piece of wood to hang on your wall.",931,"['free product', 'product', 'home', 'material', 'piles', 'wall art', 'check online', 'recyclables', 'emergency sewing kit', 'empty makeup containers', 'caps', 'hard plastic', 'new color', 'origins store', 'mac', 'old lipsticks', 'items', 'ship items', 'terracycle', 'aveda']"

Scroll through the entire website. Note specific details that you can use to develop insightful response questions to ask in your interview. This will also help you prepare relevant answers to interview questions.Take care to notice the company’s mission statement, any information about upcoming projects, and the sense of community portrayed by the company website. If the company does not have its own website, go to other Internet sites that provide extensive information about companies and industries. Simply type in the company name in an online search engine to find any sites that refer to the company.; , You can also go to competitors’ websites to get information on developments in the company's industry or sector. This will help you learn more about the business market of the job you are applying for.Look for things like revenue numbers and employee statistics that you can compare to the numbers for the company you’re interviewing with. You can also try browsing databases like Hoover’s Online, ReferenceUSA, or the Better Business Bureau.  , Corporate message boards give the opinions of current and former employees and give a different perspective on the company, although it is wise to check a number of postings rather than taking just one posting as valid information.You should be able to find these kinds of message boards by searching for the company name in an online search engine. You can also try browsing around websites like Glassdoor, which give a first-hand account about company policies and practices.  , Look up the company in the business periodical index to find articles in business publications and industry trade magazines. You can get access to a lot of information in this manner – like the company’s revenue numbers, information about the size and scope of the company, as well as other pertinent information.Many of these records are not digitized, so you may need to do some old-fashioned in-person research at the public library. For younger companies, you may only be able to find information in the most recent publications. So be sure to limit your research to the newest data.  , Ask around to see if people you already know have had any experience with the company you’re interviewing for, or if they can provide you with any information to help you prepare for the interview. News travels fast in the corporate world, so it’s likely that someone you know is already familiar with this company.   Make sure that you don’t spread the word that you’re looking for a new job if your current boss isn’t aware of this development.  , Find out all the information you can on the products and services offered by the company. Research how these products impact the industry and consider how your past work experience could relate to the services this company currently provides.Answer typical interview questions such as ""Why should we employ you?"" intelligently and thoroughly by emphasizing why the company's products and services interest you, and how you can add value to them. A good example answer would be something like this: “Your company provides many products and services that I have experience working with in a variety of capacities. I believe that my background and expertise will make me an asset and allow me to contribute effectively to the success of your company.”  , This tells you about the company culture as well as what qualities and ideologies the company values. This is important information for you to know because the interviewer will want to make sure that you embody these same values.Use this information to highlight why you are a good fit in your job interview.  , Looking forward in a company’s trajectory path is just as important as researching its history when you are preparing for a job interview. Find out what projects are planned for the future so you can see what direction the company is headed in. This will help you sound well-informed at your job interview.You can use this information to prepare insightful questions about the direction of the company to ask in your interview.  , The interviewer will want to make sure that any newly hired employee will work well with the existing staff. Research the number of employees, the kinds of employees, and a little bit about the actual people who work there.   For example, if there are a large number of people who work in the office you’ll be working in, you might want to emphasize that you are good at working as part of a team and give examples to support that. For a smaller office setting, you might want to highlight your skills as a motivated self-starter.  , Let the interviewer see that you have taken the time and trouble to find out about the company beforehand. This will show that you are committed and hardworking.   Even if you don’t bring printouts about the company, you should try to bring some notes so that you look prepared – like you have done your research.  , Let the interviewer see that you have done some background research by insightfully inserting information into your responses. If you show that you are already knowledgeable about many company practices and policies, it will make the interviewer feel like you will be a good fit for the company.Try saying something like, “In the future, I plan on pursing my MBA. I appreciate that this company values higher education and encourages its employees to pursue graduate degrees by reimbursing tuition.” Try not to go too overboard with citing company info, as it may come off as a little desperate.  , Let the interviewer know that you are serious about the job by showing that you have researched every facet. You want to show that you know who you are speaking to, as this will give a good impression to the interviewer.Make a comment about a particular career achievement of the interviewer, or the length of time they have been employed by the company.

Repeat with other arm.  ,          Put your arms straight out to your sides with your thumbs facing up. Rotate your arms so that your thumbs face straight back, then rotate them forward until your thumbs are facing straight down.  ,          Hold one arm out in front of you with your elbow bent (and close to your body) and palm facing up. With your opposite hand, grab your fingertips and slowly pull them all the way down until that hand is now facing the floor. Continue to pull on your fingertips, now in an upward direction since your palm is facing down. Repeat with other hand.  ,          Stand up and pull one leg behind you (flamingo position). Once holding onto your foot, continue to apply upward pressure. Repeat with other leg.  ,          Place one leg in front of the other (split stance) with your hands on your hips. Lean slightly forward as you begin to straighten your back leg, ideally bringing your back foot all the way flat against the floor. Repeat with other leg.  ,          Sit on the floor with both feet out in front of you. Reach out with both arms, ideally grabbing onto your toes and holding.  ,          Lie flat on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Get into a figure four position by placing one ankle on your opposite knee. Reach through and around your knee, clasp, pull it toward you, and hold. Repeat with opposite side.  ,          Sit on the floor. Press the soles of your feet together (butterfly position). Pull your feet as close to your body as possible. Put your hands on your ankles to where your elbows are lined up with your knees. Push against your elbows trying to close your legs. (This contracts your groin muscles to help you get a deeper stretch.) Push your knees down.  ,          Reach both hands behind you and then up over your head (as if to perform a butterfly stroke in swimming). Continue to swing your arms over your head and out in front of you. Try to keep both arms parallel to the floor as you are holding the stretch. To maintain balance, sit back slightly with your knees partially bent.  ,          Incline your head forward, but do not roll your head from side to side-this is dangerous. Instead, stretch your neck to the left, right, forward and back, but always return to center first! Tilt your head with ear toward shoulder, incline your head backward and roll your head from left to right, then right to left in a 30 degree motion. Be sure that while your head is tilted back, you keep your jaw relaxed and even let your mouth fall open just a bit.  ,          Incline your head back, rest your chin on your palm, and pull your jaw open. Say ""Ah!"" (you can mime it). Grab your chin with your thumb, index and middle fingers. Stretch it left to right. This exercise will help if you have been hit to the jaw (e.g., knocked-out in boxing).  , The only reason it feels good to stretch even when you're cold is because your body sends out natural painkillers. To protect your tissues, you need to raise your cardiac pulse in order to fill them with blood. The only way to do this is by working out.   Swimming is the safest way to raise your cardiac pulse. Water reduces shocks to the body because it reduces the felt effect of gravity on your body. Jumping rope can also be effective, but it may damage your tibia's periosteums, which is the membrane enveloping your bones (except at junctions) that allows the blood to flow from your heart to your muscles connected by the tendon. Swimming pools are sometimes inaccessible, so an efficient and safe way to raise cardiac pulse would be by cycling (except if you have knee problems).  , It will result with less gain than improvement on the muscle part. The CNS naturally provides resistance by stimulating antagonists muscles when you flex a muscle to prevent it from being too stretched and tear your conjunctive tissues. Never stretch prior to workout, and always do it after.  , Stretching will ensure you have an optimal circulation of body fluids throughout your system and an adequate flexibility which will prevent your connective tissues to pop when you contract your muscle.

"['do wall shin raises', 'do single leg raises', 'do heel step-downs', 'do a seated shin stretch', 'do some heel drops']",How to Exercise Your Shin Muscles1," These are simple exercises to stretch your shins while resting your back against a wall. As long as you have a solid background for support, you can do them just about anywhere.Stand with your shoulders, back, and butt up against a wall. Place your feet away from the wall, with your heels about one foot-length in front of you.Keeping your heels on the ground, raise your toes upward. Stretch as far as possible. This is called dorsiflexion. Slowly lower your toes back toward the ground, but don’t let them touch the floor. Repeat the exercise with 10–15 reps. Once you have finished the reps, let your feet back on the floor for a quick rest, then do one or two more sets.; , This exercise is very similar to the wall shin raise, but using only one foot at a time. It is a big more difficult because you will only be supporting yourself on one leg. This is a good exercise to build to after regular wall shin raises.Stand with your back against the wall, and rest one foot lightly against the wall. Dorsiflex with the foot on the ground for 10–15 reps. Once you are finished, switch your feet and repeat on the other leg. Because you are only using one leg at a time, you don’t need to rest between switching your legs.  , This is a simple exercise that you can do without a wall. You’ll be doing the same kind of dorsiflexion as the wall stand, but this time while simulating a walk.Stand up straight, not leaning against anything, with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Take a step forward, making sure only your heel plants. The step should be a normal size, so about how long you would take while walking. Hold your toes in the air, making sure the ball of your foot doesn’t get any closer than an inch to the floor. Step back to the starting position. Repeat this step with the same foot for 10–15 reps, then switch to the other leg. One variation on this exercise is to try walking around the room on your heels. Just make sure you walk very slowly, and maintain your balance. If you start to feel like you are losing your balance, rest your toes on the ground to settle., This is a simple stretching exercise you can do anywhere. You’ll probably want to be on a softer surface since you are on the floor.Get on the floor, resting on your knees. Stretch out your feet so that your toes are pointed behind you with the tops of your feet on the floor. Gently lean backward, pushing down on your heels to stretch out the front of your leg. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, then repeat three times. If you want to increase the stretch, do one leg at a time to increase the weight. You can also try lifting up your knees to further increase the resistance.  , These are simple exercises that use a ledge, like a step, to provide some resistance to your foot. This is probably best to do on the bottom of a staircase, or on a small platform, rather than using a step on the top of your stairwell.Stand with your toes on the edge of a step. Make sure you have something nearby to balance yourself. Shift your weight on to one leg (say the right), then lift the other foot (the left) off of the step. Lower your right heel downward, making sure your toes point upward. Return to your starting position, then switch legs and repeat with the other foot.

Use this initial interaction to start getting to know him and becoming friends. Are you both taking the same history class? Do you work in the same office? Find ways to talk to him, ask him questions, and get to know him. Be sure when you ask him for something to make it something where he will be helping you, but also something he won't have to go out of his way to do. If it's a major inconvenience for him, he may say no.; , As you get to know him, let him do the talking. A lot of girls can dominate the conversation, so instead of doing that, let him do the talking. Show him how much you enjoy listening to him. Build and foster the platonic aspects of the relationship.   Ask him questions about himself. This serves two purposes: you are able to find out more about him while remaining interested in him. Paying attention to him helps fuel his ego by putting him at the center of attention. This can help him start to view you as someone he wants to be around.  , As your friendship develops, be there for him. This means listening and sympathizing when he gets a bad grade on a paper, a bad evaluation at work, or has a bad day. Be ready to listen to him talk about all his problems, especially relationship problems.   Let him know you are there to listen to him anytime he needs it. Show him you are dependable and someone he can rely on.  , As you build your relationship, move from light conversations to more serious topics. Show him how smart you are through these conversations. Men are attracted to women who are intelligent and have something worthwhile to say.   Try talking about books. This is a good, neutral way to get into deep conversations. Movies, TV shows, and music also provide great conversation starters. Talk about current events. Politics and religion can be touchy categories, but there are plenty of things on the news or that you've read online that can showcase your intelligence. If you're into history, start a conversation by telling him something you recently read about the Middle Ages. If you're into science, tell him about the documentary on sharks you watched the night before., If you get to the point where you've exchanged numbers, use texting as a platform to flirt. Send funny texts about things that happen, complain about homework or work, or comment on the new movie you just saw. Using texts to showcase the fun things you do in your life helps him see how interesting you are.This is a good way to start gauging his interest level in you. Does he respond to your texts? Or does he ignore them? If he ignores them, you might not have a chance.  , One way to get closer to the guy and start to win his attention is to become friends with his friends. Get on their good side. Flirt with them so that he sees it. You want to make a good impression with his friends so that they will talk positively about you if you're mentioned or you walk by.   Don't be sleazy with his friends. You don't want him to think you are interested in his friends. You want to keep it light and fun when you flirt with them. Men are competitive creatures who are always vying to be the Alpha male. Being friends with his friends will please him because his buddies like you, but it may also make him jealous, which may result in him trying to steal your attention from them., Spend some time with him away from work, school, and other people. This can be the two of you catching a game or a movie. Try suggesting coffee after class or going for lunch during your lunch hour. You can also suggest a study date at the library or one of your houses. You want to get the two of you together and alone.  , If you don't feel like intentionally breaking up your crush and his girlfriend, then remain friends with him. Build that friendship, get to know him, and enjoy his company. This keeps you on his good side, so if he ever breaks up with the girlfriend, you are in a great position to get him.Just remember that if you want to stay friends, that you actually stay friends. Don't pretend to be friends and still try to break them up. Be genuine with him. If you're going to just stay friends with him, then don't wait on him. Meet new people, find other guys you might like, and date. You don't want to be pathetic by waiting around and pining for him.  ",856,"['friends', 'serious conversations']"
"['get a prescription antiviral drug', 'refrain from using cold and cough medicine in young children', 'use pain relievers for fevers', 'consider a flu shot']",How to Treat the Flu in Children4," There are a number of relatively new antiviral drugs that your pediatrician may recommend under some circumstances. These antiviral drugs may be recommended for children with severe flu or who are hospitalized because of the flu. These drugs may also be recommended for those children at high risk of complications, such as babies under age two and children with asthma, heart or lung disease, cancer, or diabetes. These are ideally given within the first two days of showing flu symptoms. Your doctor may first wish to test your child for the virus with a nasal swab. The following drugs have been approved in the US:Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®): This can be given to children two weeks of age or older. It is also approved for prevention of influenza in children one year of age or older. Oseltamivir can be taken as a pill or a liquid. Zanamivir (Relenza®): This medication can be given to children seven years and older. It can also be given to children five years and older in order to prevent the flu. It is not recommended for people with underlying respiratory problems, heart disease, and asthma. Zanamivir is delivered using a special inhaler (Diskhaler®). The most common side effects for Oseltamivir are nausea and vomiting while the most common side effects of Zanamivir are diarrhea, nausea, sinusitis, nasal signs and symptoms, bronchitis, cough, headache, dizziness, and ear, nose, and throat infections.  , According to the FDA, you should not use any over-the-counter cold and cough medicines for children under the age of four years. For older children, call your physician.There is evidence that indicates that these OTC cough medicines really aren’t as helpful as people believe them to be. There is a risk of serious side effects.  , It is best to allow your child's body to fight off a fever under 102 degrees Fahrenheit on its own. However, you may need to give your child a fever reducer if your child is uncomfortable or if the fever is over 102. To reduce a fever, you can give a child older than six months old ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen can also help with any aches or pains your child has.You can give acetaminophen to babies under six months old, but contact your doctor if you are not sure about how much to give. Don't give aspirin to any child under the age of 19 with the flu.Alternatively, you can bathe your child in lukewarm water to bring the fever down and make your child more comfortable.  , Talk to your doctor about a vaccination against the flu for you and your children. The CDC recommends that anyone over the age of six months should be vaccinated.Two flu vaccines are available for children. One vaccine covers three flu virus strains, while the other covers four strains. However, the specific vaccines change each year and may contain different numbers and types of strains. Children over the age of two may be able to use a nasal spray vaccine; however, it is unclear whether or not the spray is effective. Discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist first and see what they recommend.  ",524,"['prescription antiviral drug', 'young children', 'cough medicine', 'flu shot', 'use pain relievers', 'fevers']"

One very active horse forum is located (appropriately) at horseforum.com.With tens of thousands of threads on topics like horse health, horse grooming, horse training, and much, much more, it's likely that any question you might have has already been answered. Other great forums include the official forums at the Chronicle of the Horse and the community forums at community.horse.com.; , Believe it or not, streaming video sites (especially YouTube) can be a great source of information on horses. For instance, if you're trying to figure out how to accomplish a specific task (like shoe your horse), there will likely be at least several video tutorials submitted by users for you to browse through. These sorts of DIY video guides are fantastic for beginners because they show you what to do, rather than explaining it through walls of text.   Note that YouTube also has several full-length documentaries on horses available (including The Path of the Horse) which are great for supplemental information.  , Societies and charities dedicated to the well-being of animals have a natural interest in providing free, high-quality care instructions for animals. If you're looking for information on how to care for a horse humanely or trying to figure out what sorts of responsibilities you'd have if you got a horse, these sites can be very valuable resources.   The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is a valuable resource for information on properly caring for a wide range of animals including horses. With tips on general care, nutrition, behavior, and preparing for potential problems, the ASPCA's horse resources have plenty to offer newcomers.Similarly, the British Horse Society, the largest equestrian charity in the UK, has a huge range of horse care guides available online., Horses aren't as easy to buy as, for instance, cars — there a number of precautions and preparations a prospective buyer must make before she even brings her new horse home. If you're looking on information for what to expect after buying a horse or the accommodations you'll need to make to be able to buy one, try visiting the sites of the agencies that breed, sell, and register horses.   For example, the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), a horse breed registry, offers an extremely detailed guide covering the most important basics of buying a horse, including determining which type of horse to buy and making housing arrangements., If you're trying to learn about the ways that horses function as living, breathing organisms, scientific resources are your best bet. While even sources as general as Wikipedia can have useful horse information, sources put together by scientists and/or horse experts are generally more reputable.   A good place for beginners to start is the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), a free online biological resource. The EOL horse page contains the most important foundational information about horses, including the species' complete scientific classification.The National Geographic horse page offers a good amount information on the history of horse evolution and domestication.The Journal of Equine Veterinary Science is a professional-level resource that publishes articles on the latest in horse medicine. Unfortunately, only the abstracts of the articles are available for free., While the sources above should answer most questions about horses, they may not always be 100% exhaustive.

Make sure all of your pups are well fed, (you can tell by how red the paws are) if the paws are pink, feed them. Eat some carcasses and get the red bar high for extra food on the way. , Slowly carry them away. After you get a short distance away from your den, either wait for your mate to bring all the pups to you or go and get them yourself. Although this can cause your mate to bring the pup you carried back to you. Continue this until a predator comes or your pups are hungry., These steps are continued for the rest of the journey to make sure your pups survive. This is what to do when a predator comes.  Bear: Chase after it at fast as you can. When you catch up to it, bite it. If your mate is near it will come and help you. Make sure to bite it three times and it will run off. If you don't, it will bother your for the rest of the way, making it dangerous to keep your pups safe and if you become weak you or your pups may die. Coyote: If you see any signs of a coyote at all, follow the scent trail or chase after it and kill it.  Eagles can kill your pups even when they're in your mouth. The only way to make sure an eagle leaves is when it reaches the ground to grab your pup, run towards it and bite it. It's impossible to kill an eagle, so it will just fly away.  , When your pups gets hungry, you can either feed them with the extra food you saved or hunt yourself. If your pups' bars get too low, your mate will run off to hunt. Do not join her or him, because if a predator comes when you are away, it will probably kill your pup even if you run as soon as you get the warning. Just let your mate come to feed them.  If however, you want to hunt yourself, it is dangerous to hunt elk, because this can take a long time. The best chance you have is to hunt a bunny or eat off of carcasses to feed your pups. If you ever find a carcass, feed your pups then come back to eat some more. This will help when there is no food nearby and your pups are hungry.  , Even if it looks like you won't have to cross a river on the map, you still will, no matter what. If you decide to get a den close to the U shape in the river, it is much easier, though., This can take a long time, but you will know when you don't have to swim, where the shallow spot is. Some can run across the water without finding a shallow spot, but that is a risk. The glitch could stop halfway through and your pup could drown. So instead of having that risk, you'll need to find the shallow spot, and fast. Sometimes your mate will bring the pup to you while you're in the water. If this happens, run to it as quick as you can and take it out before it dies. Feed it and continue., If it gets in the water, pick it up and run to the next side and feed it. Don't go to grab your other pups. Wait for your mate to bring them to you, because if you go to grab another pup he or she might bring the pup back to you., Continue feeding and defending the pups, eating extra meat and carrying pups until you reach the end.

Jeans come in a variety of different colors and washes so you never have to feel bored wearing them. Also, you can mix up the fit by having skinny jeans, boy-cut jeans, or flare jeans., Longer skirts that hit the knee are a great way to stay casual, but step up your look. Wear flowing skirts that fall away from your body, and pair them with casual tops likes T-shirts, long sleeve shirts, or blouses. You can choose any pattern or color skirt that you want, just be sure the fit is not too tight or too short.  , An easy way to look chic for school is to find simple tops you can wear repeatedly. Find classic cut tops such as crew necks, V-necks, and collared shirts. Buy neutral colors like black, white, navy, brown, and gray that are solid colors or have stripes. You can mix and match these tops with any style jean or skirt.The majority of your tops should be neutral. You should only have a few special tops such as a shirt with rhinestones or words that you wear occasionally.  , Modern fashion includes all sorts of styles and color combinations, but there are certain colors that clash together and should not be paired up. To create an outfit that is complimentary together, keep color in mind. Colors that are directly opposite of each other on the color wheel are considered complementary such as blue and orange, pink and green, and yellow and purple. Wearing complimentary colors creates an attractive, color-rich palette.   For example, you could wear a pink shirt with a green cardigan, or a blue skirt with an orange sweater. Keep the color wheel in mind, but do not be afraid to match other colors you think work well together.  , Everyone needs to have essential pieces in their wardrobe that can be easily mixed and matched to any outfit. Here is a list of pieces you should invest in and how to wear them:   A plain white T-shirt is great on its own or for layering. You can wear it under a sweater, over a tank top, paired with a cardigan, tucked into a skirt, or left free with a pair of jeans. A striped shirt, in any color, looks great with a solid, floral, or plaid skirt or jeans. Add your favorite cardigan, and you will create a classic look.Dark denim looks great on everyone. Whether the jeans are skinny, bootleg, or flare cut, they will pair perfectly with a striped shirt, floral blouse, or sweater. Over-sized cardigans are a must have for current trends. You can never have too many cardigans to pair with your T-shirts, blouses, tank tops, or button downs. Start off with basic colors such as black, blue, and brown, and then accumulate more in brighter colors and designs that you can pair with just about any top.  , As the seasons change, and your outfits, your shoes should as well. It can be boring wearing the same flats, tennis shoes, or boots everyday. Allow yourself several options for shoes, and just be sure they are all comfortable.   Ballet flats are the perfect shoe to dress up or dress down, and they are very comfortable.Have a black and brown shoe option. This will help you always have a pair of shoes to match any outfit. Steer away from wearing high heels to school. Unless you have a special school function, there is no need for a shoe over three inches. If you do wear a shoe like a stiletto, you might get other students questioning your shoe choice.  , You can make your casual outfits more interesting by adding jewelry such as a bracelet, earrings, necklace, or ring. Do not go overboard with your look as it is better to keep it simple by just adding one or two pieces.   Statement jewelry, like larger necklaces, may not be the best way to go for a school look. Opt for more delicate pieces when you are trying to create a look that is school appropriate.

If they don't want much help, that's okay. You can still help by telling them a few tips and tricks, or helping with homework. , Remember when it was your first year of middle school or high school, and you were panicking to get every- and anything? And then how it turned out you didn't need 1 million notebooks? You probably have some extra supplies that you can give to your sibling. After all, you wouldn't want to be stuck carrying around unnecessary things. There's no reason why you can't help your sibling, at least with something like this!, It's a horrible feeling to be late to class on the first day of school, so imagine how your sibling feels thinking that might happen! You've been to the school for at least a year, you know the layout. Even if you don't have your sibling's schedule, make them a map showing the different classrooms, even the ones they don't need to know. If there are any ""landmarks"" in the school, include them. People typically find it useful when there are landmarks, not just in schools., While it might seem fun to poke fun at people who are younger and less experienced than you, don't do it. Nobody wants to be friends with the person who makes fun of random people! Besides, making fun of your sibling at school can be a great way to get in trouble, and unless there's something you need an excuse to miss, you don't want that., Maybe your sibling came from a smaller school, where almost everyone knew everyone. Imagine how it feels when you go to a new school that's at least twice as big! Teach your sibling that it's okay to not be popular, and it's almost impossible to know everybody. If you have to, you can also give friendship and relationship advice., You may want to help your sibling, but some things you just have to let them experience for themselves. You don't want to seem like a parent who is too over-controlling, do you? You don't even want to seem like a parent! You're not there to set the rules, you're there to help your sibling., If your sibling's friends went to another school or moved away, they may feel lonely, and it can be scary to make new friends right away. If you see your sibling is sitting by themselves, it's fine to invite them over. So yes, the popular kids might look at you funny for sitting with one of the ""new kids"", but later your sibling will thank you. It feels nice to so a good deed., How did you feel when you first came to the school? Nervous? Excited? Chances are, your sibling is feeling that way too. Sometimes all somebody needs is someone to talk to. If they feel to embarrassed to talk to your parents, you can also listen. Remember to not brag or show off how much you are of an expert, just listen. However, don't be afraid to report something of your sibling is acting overly anxious. Look out for your sibling's mental health too., A new concept in school can be confusing, and your parents may not be able to help if it's not in their area of expertise or they forgot. If your sibling gets frustrated, try to calm them down and explain it as simply as possible. If they start fighting you, though, leave the room/situation and tell your parents. You're not a tattle-tale for protecting yourself from getting injured., Unless you're starting a new school as well, it's your sibling's moment to shine. They've made it this far from working hard.

"['live in an interesting or unique location', 'have your own story', 'make yourself accessible', 'contact the appropriate stations', 'be prepared if you do get approached']",How to Become a Star of Your Own Reality TV Show," Where you live can make a difference. Where you live has a lot to do with whether or not you are ‘reality show’ worthy. Right now, Alaskan reality shows are very common, and because of this, the people who live there have been made targets for reality TV stardom. Thus, you may have more chance if you live in Alaska or somewhere similar, depending on what's trending at the time. Not everyone can choose where they live, but if you can choose where to live, try to find a place that is common for reality shows.   Note that the location factor changes often, as different things become popular. Unique geographical locations (Hawaii, Alaska, the ‘wilderness’) are all very common places for reality show settings. Also, bigger cities like New York and Los Angeles are well known for their ‘filming scene’. You don't have to have a 'rich' lifestyle to be famous in the reality TV world. Benefit Street was popular in the UK and New Zealand.; , Everyone has a tale to tell! Have a fascinating background story. What makes your life interesting? Fur buyers in a very remote part of Alaska who live in an Inuit village and live a subsistence lifestyle (hunting, fishing, and gathering a lot of their food) are ideal reality TV stars, for example. If your life is anything like that, great, you have more chance of being a reality TV star than a school girl from Norwich, unless she drives dog sleds.   Live a life that very few people live, and, if it’s a life many people find interesting, television channels may believe it’s worthy of its own show. Anything can be a good story. Get creative and think of something that makes your life truly unique. You could take a road trip across America with your best friends or live as a hermit (never leaving your apartment) in one of America’s most populated cities. There are literally endless possibilities for a reality show––all you need to do is think of one that’s truly going to ‘wow’ a viewing audience and make them want to tune in each week for every episode.  , It's all about who you know. Be accessible to people who want to hear your story. Basically, use the Internet to market yourself. By putting your story out there on the web, you are welcoming anyone to contact you:   Write blogs, make YouTube videos, run your own website. Use social media and have connections to people. Make the effort to have your contact information accessible. Have an email readily and easily found on all of your websites. If you have a business website, always have a phone number associated with it. This makes you an easy target for people scouting for reality shows because you can be easily contacted and any program makers will have a bit of a background regarding what you do.  , Pitching your own show to the appropriate station could work wonders. Many television stations welcome ideas being pitched to them, and will listen to different thoughts regarding a reality show. You may not always get a reply, but if you have a true ‘gem’, they will certainly make an effort to get in contact with you. Moreover, by approaching a station that fits the show you’re looking to market, you could set yourself up for a lot of success.  , Be flattered and a bit starstruck but keep your wits about you. Ask a lot of questions. The pay, although often mistaken for being quite high, is not typically a ‘get rich quick scheme’. In fact, the pay per episode is very low in the beginning of reality shows.

"['take your dog to the vet for a professional cleaning', 'examine your dog’s mouth', 'brush your dog’s teeth', 'use an oral rinse or gel', 'feed your dog dental food', 'give your dog chew toys']",How to Prevent Canine Periodontal Disease1," One important step in preventing periodontal disease is taking your dog to get oral checkups and cleaning by the vet.Depending on the state of your dog’s mouth, you may want to schedule quarterly or half-yearly checks.Oral cleanings help reduce bacteria that can lead to periodontal disease.; , Examine your dog’s mouth by lifting his lips.If you see any tartar build up, gingivitis, or any other sign of periodontal disease, make an appointment with your veterinarian to have the mouth examined and to schedule a tooth cleaning.   You cannot remove the tartar from the teeth on your own. Your dog will need to be anesthetized and special tools will be used to remove this concrete hard substance from the teeth and below the gum line.  , One of the best ways to prevent periodontal disease is to brush your dog’s teeth. This process is simpler than it may seem. You will need to purchase a dog toothbrush, which can be either an actual brush or a finger brush, or a child’s soft toothbrush. You also need a dog toothpaste.To get your dog used to having their teeth brush, start by putting a dab of the toothpaste on your finger to let the dog taste it. Then you can put another dab on your finger and rub it in a circular motion along the outside of the teeth. It may take a few days for the dog to let you rub your fingers along his teeth. Once he does, you can over a few days slowly introduce the brush with toothpaste into the dog’s mouth. The process of brushing should only take less than a minute since you will mainly concentrate on the outer tooth surfaces. Do not use human toothpaste because the fluoride in it can be toxic to dogs, and do not use baking soda because dog's shouldn't swallow that either. Anything you brush your dog's teeth with will be swallowed. Buy dog toothpaste that is made so it can be safely swallowed., Oral rinses and gels contain chlorhexidine or zinc. You can place the rinse or gel in your dog’s water bowl. You can also wipe them on your dog’s teeth to help control plaque.Since the rinse or gel can be added to the dog's water or wiped on the teeth, the products are safe to swallow.These are best used in conjunction with tooth brushing and regular dental cleanings by your veterinarian. Do not use these products if your dog has medical conditions unless you consult your veterinarian first.  , You can start feeding your dog food specifically designed to help with dental care. These specialty foods have built in product or particle sizes which either mechanically or chemically remove plaque. These feeds can be kibble or rawhide type chews. They will be labeled specifically as dental food or designed to clean dog's teeth and prevent plaque on the bag.Examples of dental food include the Science Diet Oral Care by Hill's Pet Nutrition, Iams Chunk Dental Defense Diet, and Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Diets Canine dry dog food. Check the Veterinary Oral Health Council's list of accepted products for further options.Look for dental foods that have the VOHC seal. This means the food has been tested by the Veterinary Oral Health Council for its effectiveness in cleaning teeth and preventing plaque.If your dog has a medical condition, do not use unless your veterinarian okay’s it for your dog.  , If your dog loves to chew, you can purchase toys that are specifically designed to help rub the plaque off your dog’s teeth. You can also give your dog dental treats to help clean his teeth. Many of these dental treats and toys are labeled on the bag to specifically treat tartar build up and plaque.Dental treats and toys are sold at all pet stores and most supercenters. Examples include Greenies band, Tartar Shield Soft Rawhide Chews, and Purina Busy HeartyHide Chew Treats.If you use chewing toys, make sure to wash them frequently to remove any bacteria. Never let your dog chew bones, hooves, antlers, ice cubes, or any other item that may break his teeth.

Listen closely and you can hear Jack White sliding around the guitar. It is most pronounced right before he launches into the riff, sliding into that 7th fret note.   , If you were to play the song with just an acoustic guitar, for example, you'd need to know the chord melodies. But these chords could be used for any cover or version -- look at Marcus Collins version, which uses rhythm guitar in the verse where the original has none. To play chord melodies, simply play the following chords -- each chord times up to the same note in the bass riff above.   E (7th fret, 5th string)  G (5th fret, 4th string)  D (5th fret, 5th string)  C (3rd fret, 5th string  B (2nd fret, 5th string  These can be played as straight chords or powerchords., To get a real ""White Stripes"" sound from your guitar, your amp needs to be adjusted a little. Don't worry, you're not opening anything up, just change the settings a little. You'll need quite a bit of gain, try turning that up to 8. To even that out, keep your treble all the way up to 7 or 8 too. Keeps the mids at 5 while the bass should be pumped up to 8. If your amp has an effect called ""Presence"", turn that up to 8 too.  , Power chords are simple 2-finger chords used for big, brash, and quick songs. If you've never made them, they are actually easy to build. Start with your index finger on any fret on the top two strings -- use the first note of the Seven Nation Army riff (7th fret, 5th string) to start. Now, simply place your ring finger one string and two frets down, on the 9th fret, 4th string. Only play these two strings -- this is your power chord   For even bigger, better chords, add your pinky on the string and fret below your ring finger (9th fret, 3rd string), so your final chord has three notes. The note your index finger is on determines the chord. Since the note in the example is an E, this is an E power chord.  , This is the section that begins with the words (in the first verse, at least) ""and the message in my eyes..."" As he says this you should:   Hit a G power chord (3rd fret, 6th string) for one full measure. Switch to an A power chord (5th fret, 6th string) or an open A (2nd fret, 2nd-4th strings) for one full measure.  , You want to start with one big strum, followed up by a shorter one. In case you've forgotten, an E power chord looks like this:   e|--X-- B|--X-- G|--X-- D|-(9)- A|--9-- E|--7--  , After the second, quicker strum, jump quickly up to the 10th fret and strum it once. This chord takes the place of the 5th fret, 3rd string shown in the bass riff above.   e|--XX-- B|--XX-- G|--XX-- D|-(12)- A|--12-- E|--10--  , From here on out, you'll be repeating the bass riff, just with power chords. Hit the E one more time on you way back up the guitar.  , Your next chord is another power chord, the 5th fret on the 5th string.   e|--X-- B|--X-- G|--X-- D|-(7)- A|--7-- E|--5--  , Keep on following the bass riff. The chord is still the same shape. This is a C power cord, sometimes called a C5.   e|--X-- B|--X-- G|--X-- D|-(5)- A|--5-- E|--3--  , The last chord is the B and is located on the 2nd fret of the 5th string. Once you've hit this, there is a brief pause before you simply repeat the chords once more for the chorus.   e|--X-- B|--X-- G|--X-- D|-(4)- A|--4-- E|--2--  , ""Seven Nation Army"" is simple, and doesn't have any vigorous strumming. After learning all of the power chords, you need to learn the actual song. There are three parts: a verse, a chorus, and a bridge. Listen to the song to see how the music changes during these parts.   The Verse is only bass and drums. You can, however, play the chords of the song, or play the bass riff on guitar. The bridge is simply your way in and out of the chorus. At the end of the verse, right before jumping into the power chords, play the two chord bridge. You also play it after the chorus, right before going into the verse again. The chorus is your power chord riff. This exact same riff is also played behind the guitar solo.  , The guitar solo in ""Seven Nation Army"" isn't technically difficult. But rhythmically it is almost in perfect tune with the iconic bass riff from the beginning of the song. This this powerful, plodding, and deliberate rhythm is key to making the solo sound nice.   If you need, review and learn the bass line before the solo. It is easy enough and will help immensely.  All you're doing is taking the following sets of notes, and putting them through the same rhythm as the bass solo. Start part one of the solo on the 9th fret, 3rd string. The solo has two parts -- both of which follow the style of the bass riff. The first half starts on the 9th string, playing the 9th string repeatedly in place of the held root note in the bass riff. After leaving the 9th, keep playing the rest of the notes as if they were the bass guitar. Play this riff twice.  |G|-----9~~--9-9-9-9/12b--11~---9~~-9-12-14-12--12-12/14-12-11-----  , This riff is when the guitar really starts to squeal. Keep practising, playing along with the song, to get the feel for the bends. Note, as well, how much vibrato (when you ""shake"" a note, as indicated by the ""~"") is used to give the notes flavor and attitude.   |e|-----12--12-15-12-12-15b--14~~----12--12-15-17-15--15-15/17-15-14~~-----  , The last little section of the song sounds great if you play the B-string occasionally as well, barring both strings on the same fret. This can add some of the body and power to your solo as you're playing, helping you capture some of the attitude of the original.   |e|-----12--12-14-12-12-15b-15~~----12--12-14-12-12-14-12.  , Once the solo is over, quickly play the 13th and 12th frets on the B-string (2nd string). Then jump into a quiet rendition of your bridge -- the G and A power chords-- to transition back into the verse.   If you know how, palm mute these last two chords for the best effect.",1213,"['rhythm', 'notch', 'bass note riff', 'shape', '5th fret', 'solo', 'index finger', '1st string', 'g.', 'bass guitar', 'outro', '17th fret', 'high-pitched notes', 'bridge chords', 'finger shape', 'song', 'whole power chord', 'guitar chords', 'power chord', '2nd fret', 'last power chord', 'amp', 'playing', 'chorus', 'chord', 'last section', 'power chords', '12th fret', '3rd fret power chord', '10th fret', 'quick strum', 'order', 'verse', 'strums', 'two-chord bridge', 'neck', 'centre', 'entire thing']"

Stipulate that if they take the penny, they would then get to double the amount of money they have every day for two months. In fact, tell them they can have two months with 31 days in them (like July and August), a total of 62 days.   Most people will take the ten million dollars. It seems like an obvious choice!; , Tell them to take their time and think their decision through before giving you their final answer. Act like you think it's a tough choice to make.   Your friends will probably stick with the $10 million rather than the penny that doubles in value every day for two months.  , The math is quite simple, but your friends will be amazed at how much even a small sum will grow by doubling every day. On a sheet of paper, begin with a single penny and multiply by two each day for 62 days:   Day 1, one penny. Day 2, multiply the amount of day 1 by 2, making 2 pennies. Day 3, multiply the amount of day 2 by 2, making 4 pennies. Day 4, multiply the amount of day 3 by 2, making 8 pennies. Day 5, multiply the amount of day 4 by 2, making 16 pennies. Day 6, multiply the amount of day 5 by 2, making 32 pennies.  , They'll change their mind as you keep multiplying by 2. You're going to need a calculator at some point, because by the time you get to day 31, your penny will have grown to 21,474,836.40! That's right — over 20 million pennies.  , By this point you've already convinced your friends that they made a big mistake choosing the ten million dollars. You don't need to go through the math for the second month to drive the point home. Instead, jump ahead to the final amount they would have earned if they'd taken the doubling penny: a staggering 46,116,860,184,273,900!   That number’s so large your friends might not even know how to say it! In the U.S. the number is called 46 quadrillion (plus). That’s the same as 46,000 trillion or 46 million billion pennies.  , The amounts you get from the calculations above tell you how many pennies you have, not how many dollars. Divide those amounts by 100 to see how many dollars you will have earned at the one- and two-month marks. It's still an amazing amount of money.  , Exponents of a number (the base) means multiply it by itself the number of times stated in the exponent (the power).  , Because 1 multiplied by itself to any power is still 1, you have to start with a base of 2. Okay now double base of 2 instead of 1. So using base of 2 you can see that 2^3 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 4 x 2 = 8 . So then 2^4 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 x 2 = 16, etc. So, raising 2 to an exponent of 30 for the first month (of course the 31st power is on day one of the 2nd month...), and to 61 for the second month solution will give you your number of pennies after two 31 day months.  , For example, open the Windows calculator accessory, then you can click View and select Scientific and type 2 then press the key, then type 30 and press the key to see the amount of pennies for the 1st month. To get the feel of using the calculator for that key, try the calculator for 2 to the 3rd power which is 8, and the 4th power which is 16, the 5th power of 2 is 32, etc. So, 32 pennies is exactly what you would have on day 6 of doubling, using the 5th power, since we had to start using the powers of 2 on day two.  , The investment that doubles your money every single day doesn't exist. The example you gave them was purely hypothetical. However, we can all learn something important from it.  , Compounding refers to earning additional interest paid on earlier-earned interest (much like doubling pennies day after day). Compounding takes your first investment (the principal), adds all the earned interest (plus any newly added principal) before figuring the next interest payment. This means you get ""interest on all the earlier interest,"" not just on the principal. This is true for each compounding period (such as a month). The shorter the compounding period, the more often your investment compounds. This means ""the more often your investment compounds, the faster it grows.""   The most common compounding periods are daily, monthly, quarterly and yearly. The concept of compounding is important when considering investments like savings accounts and mutual funds. Look for accounts in which interest compounds daily.  , After the frequency of your compounding period, this is the most important factor in safe and fast growth. Add as much money as possible to your investment as often as you can. This might be $50 a month, $100 per paycheck — whatever you can afford.   The key is to save first and spend later.  , Bankrate.com has an interest calculator that shows how different choices can affect an investment. With the calculator you can figure different compounding periods, interest rates, and contribution amounts and frequencies.   Enter an initial investment, but leave the ""monthly deposit"" option blank, like you're not going to add any more money. Leave the interest rate the same as well. Change the compounding periods, and check the results over time — say, ten years. You can see how important frequent compounding periods are for long-term investments. Now add regular monthly deposits — even small ones — and see how much the investment grows over time.  , You can do this through special accounts with tax benefits such as 401(k), IRA, and Roth IRA accounts. These three types of retirement accounts all benefit greatly from compounding and regular contributions. They are similar in that they are free to open, and they allow small initial deposits.   Open a 401(k) plan directly through your employer. You can open IRA accounts through banks and brokers.  , Will your contributions be pre-tax or post-tax? Pre-tax contributions receive a tax deduction during the year in which you make them. For example, if you earn $50k and contribute $5,000 toward your IRA, you get a $5,000 tax deduction for the year. You will pay taxes on that money when you withdraw it in the future. You don't receive a deduction for post-tax contributions, but you also don't pay taxes on future withdrawals.   Most 401(k) programs have both options available. Regular IRAs are for pre-tax contributions and Roth IRAs for post-tax contributions. It may be convenient to have both pre-tax and post-tax accounts, because your financial situation can change periodically. Contribute each year to the account most appropriate for you at the time.  , In certain cases (self-loans, first mortgages, medical expenses), you can withdraw money from an IRA or 401(k) with no penalty. Usually, though, there's a 10% penalty for withdrawal before retirement age.  , Automatic payroll deductions make saving easier by putting money into savings before you get paid. This stops you from having to rely on what's left at the end of the month for your monthly deposits. It ensures regular deposits of the same amount.  , While they probably won't match your investment completely, they might match it up to a certain point. For example, a company might match 50% of what an employee contributes annually to their IRA or other investment up to $5,000.   If you add $100 per month, by year's end you'll have added $1200 to your retirement savings. Your employer will have added another $600 as well. That results in $1800 in just one year, not counting compound interest. If you could afford $1000 per month, you would not have $18,000 at the end of the year. You'd only have $17,000 because the employer's match was limited to $5000 per year in this example.

Keep in mind that you can choose any color and style of ballet flats that you like. For example, if you want a pair with pointed toes, then look for a pair of pointed toe flats. If you want a pair with polka dots, then look for some polka dot ballet flats. Before you get started, you will need:a pair of ballet flats in the style and color of your choice leather or faux leather fabric (in a color that matches the ballet flats) scissors ruler fabric glue 10 binder clips leather cord (in a color that matches the ballet flats); , Use your ruler to measure out 10 strips of your leather or faux leather measuring 1 centimeter (0.39 in) by 3cm each. You can use a marker or pen to mark on the back side of the material. Then, cut out the strips.         Keep in mind that leather will not fray, so you do not need to worry about the raw edges.If you are using leather, then make sure that the leather you use is thin enough to bend into loops. Also keep in mind that leather thickness is measured in ounces. For best results, choose a piece of leather that is no more than 3oz. thick., Next, fold over one of the strips so that the two short ends are lined up and the leather forms a loop. Apply some fabric glue between the two ends, but make sure to leave enough space for the cord or ribbon to pass through. Then, clamp a binder clip over the ends of the leather to help the ends bond tightly.         Follow the same process for the rest of your leather strips. When you are done, you should have 10 loops. Let the glue dry completely. Since you do not need a lot of glue to secure each of the loops, they should be dry in about an hour. However, you may want to leave the loops for a few hours to ensure that they are totally dry. If you want, you could even make loops out of a special ribbon or out of some colorful shoelaces. Some people have even skipped the loop step altogether and used a leather hole punch to punch holes in the ballet flats., After the loops have dried, you will need to glue them onto the inside of your ballet flats. Apply a generous dab of fabric glue to the inside of the shoe and clamp each of the loops onto the shoe with a binder clip.         Start by gluing one loop to the inside of one of the ballet flats. Position the loop so that it is centered near the toes. Attach your next two loops slightly higher up on the inside of the shoe so that they are opposite each other, but still somewhat near to the toes. Then, attach your final two loops for the first shoe. These loops should be positioned so that they will be just in front of the ankle, similar to how laces are placed on sneakers. Attach the loops in the same places for your other shoe. Use the position of your loops on the first shoe as a guide to help you position the loops on the second shoe. Allow the glue to dry completely on both shoes. Leave them to dry overnight if possible.  , Take your leather cord or ribbon and cut it in half so that you have two pieces of the same length. After the glue has dried, start threading your leather cord or ribbon through the loops.         Begin with the loop near the toes and make sure that there is an equal amount of cord or ribbon on both sides. Then, thread the cord or ribbon through the next two loops. Criss-cross the cord or ribbon and then thread the cord or ribbon through the final two loops. Repeat the same threading process with the other pair. You will have enough excess cord or ribbon to wrap the pieces around your ankles a couple of times. Then, tie the cord or ribbon in a bow to secure them.  , Adding a back flap is optional, but the result is a slightly more dramatic, intricate shoe. If you want to amp up the drama of your ballet flats, then you will need a few extra items. You will need:template for the back flapanother piece of leather or faux leather a permanent marker in the same color as your leather.  , Cut out the paper template and then use it to trace the shape onto your leather or faux leather. You will need to have two of these flaps, so trace the design twice. Then, cut out the shapes.         The cut edges of leather will not fray, so you do not need to hem the sides.If you are using a non-leather material, then you may want to check to see if the edges fray when you cut them. If they do fray, then you will also need to fold over the sides and glue them. If the edges fray, then fold over the sides and glue them before you create the loop in the top if the flap.  , The top part of the flap is a little wider than the bottom part. You will need to create a loop at the top of the flap so that you can thread your leather cord or ribbon through this space.         Fold the top part of one of the leather flaps and apply a generous amount of fabric glue to the flap. Make sure that you are leaving a wide enough space for the cord or ribbon to pass through. Secure each of the flap sides with a binder clip. Do not use pins to hold the leather in place. Pins will leave permanent holes in your leather.Let the glue dry completely. It might take a few hours for your glue to dry, depending on how much glue you apply. You can let it dry overnight if you want to be totally sure that it is dry. Repeat the same process for the other flap.  , The sides of the leather piece will likely be much lighter than the front side of the leather. To blend the colors, you can color in the sides of the leather with a matching permanent marker.         For example, if the leather you are using is dyed black, then the side edges may look tan. You can use a black permanent marker to color over the tan edges.  , Next, you will need to secure the flaps to the heels of your shoes. Apply fabric glue to the lower part of the flaps and press the flaps onto the heels of your shoes.         Allow the glue to dry completely before you do anything else. Since this part cannot be clamped down and you are gluing over a larger area, you may want to let the glue dry overnight or even for 24 hours.  , After the flaps have dried, take the end of one piece of cord or ribbon and start to thread it through one side of the flap until it comes out on the other side. Then pull the rest of the cord or ribbon through.         Thread the other piece of cord or ribbon through the opposite end of the flap loop. After you have pulled the cord or ribbon through both sides, you should still be able to wrap the cord or ribbon around your ankles a few times. The cord or ribbon will just be higher up than it would be without the flaps. Tie the ends in a bow to secure them.

Give yourself permission to worry, but only during certain times of the day.For example, you might set aside a half an hour after dinner each day for worrying. If a worry pops into your head at any other time, you can recognize it, but just tell yourself ""I'll think about that later.""This technique lets you set your worries aside for awhile so you can get through your day.; , A study from the University of Chicago shows that writing your worries down can help you let go of them.Writing your worries down can help make the problem feel more manageable.   This strategy works well with postponing your worries. Making note of them on the list can help you feel like you can let your worries go until ""worry time."" Then, when it is worry time, you can just go over your list., Talking through your worries can also help. It can put things in perspective and help you get to the root of your issues.Be aware though that too much of this can be hard for your friends. If this is an ongoing issue, consider seeing a counselor or other mental health professional.  , Recent studies have shown that people who rely on computers and other devices for social interaction suffer from more anxiety.Consider cutting down on your screen time to help with excess worrying.Social media use in particular may lead to conflict, and comparison of yourself with others. It can also make it harder to relax. All this can promote worry.Switching off your devices several times a day can give you more control over your relationship with technology., Doing something with your hands, such as knitting or using ""worry beads"" may help reduce stress and worry.Recent studies by the Medical Research Council show that keeping your hands busy during troubling events may reduce how much they bother you later.The research has not discovered any impact on worries about things that have already happened. But, if you are in a troubling situation, do something patterned and repetitive with your hands. It might reduce worries about it later., Exercising is not just good for your body. It is also an effective way to decrease the anxiety that leads to worry.Regular exercise may be more effective than prescription drugs for decreasing your anxiety levels.   Research on animals shows that exercise increases levels of serotonin. This is a brain chemical that relieves anxiety and makes you feel happier., Taking slow deep breaths activates the vagus nerve, which can help reduce stress and worry.Some people recommend taking ""4-7-8"" breaths when worried. To do this, exhale completely through your mouth. Then, inhale through your nose, counting to four as you do so. Hold your breath for seven seconds. Finally, exhale through your mouth, counting to eight as you do so., Medical research shows that meditating affects the brain in ways that decrease worrying. If you are a persistent worrier learning how to meditate may be very helpful.   Meditation increases activity in the Ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that controls worrying.It also grounds you in the present moment. Meditation, done right, should make it impossible to think about future problems, at least while you are meditating.  , Recent medical studies support the claim that the scents of certain essential oils can reduce stress and worry. In particular, the smell of grapefruit was shown to be effective in this area.Essential oils and other aromatherapy products are available in many health stores and natural food shops. You can also try just smelling a grapefruit!  , Sometimes, trying to suppress your worries seems to just make them worse. So, don't try to ignore your worries. When they pop into your head, accept them, but then try to move on.It is hard to avoid thinking about something you are actively trying not to think about.Writing your worries down or setting a designated ""worry time"" can be very helpful in letting them pass., When you do think about your worries, a good way to process them is to categorize them. Specifically, for each try to determine the following:    Is this problem one you can solve, or not? If a worry is about a problem you have the power to fix, the best remedy may be to start fixing it. Once you have a plan to fix the problem, you will be less worried. If you cannot solve the problem, accept it, work through it and move on. Is this worry about something that is likely, or unlikely, to happen? A worry about something that is likely to happen may indeed be troubling. On the other hand, if you decide it is not likely to occur, this can be a first step in letting that worry go.Is this worry about something about something really bad, or not? Think about what it is that you are worried might happen. If it did occur, how bad would it really be? Most things we worry about aren't actually that terrible. If you decide it wouldn't be a catastrophe, this can help you let go. That's doubly true if it also isn't that likely to happen!Throughout this process, try to think rationally. Ask yourself what evidence you have that your worry is a realistic one. Think about what you might tell a friend who had the same worry. Try to imagine the most likely outcome, rather than the worst-case scenario., If there is a specific worry that bothers you often, you can try to make it boring, so your brain will return to it less often. Do this by repeating it in your head again and again for several minutes.For example, if you worry that you might get in a car accident, repeat in your head the words ""I might get in a car accident, I might get in a car accident."" In the short term, this may increase you anxiety. But, after a little while, the words will lose their power and become boring to you. Chances are, they'll stop popping up in your mind so often after that.  , An important change in your thinking is accepting that life is unpredictable and imperfect. This is key to stopping worries in the long term. A good place to start this change is with a writing exercise. Jot down your answers to these questions:Is it possible to be certain about everything that might happen? In what way is needing certainty helpful to you? Do you tend to predict bad things will happen just because you are uncertain? Is that reasonable? Can you live with the possibility that a bad thing might happen, if that outcome is not likely? When worries come to mind, try to remind yourself of your answers to these questions.  , Emotions can be contagious. If you spend a lot of time with other worriers, or people who make you anxious, you may want to reconsider how much time you are spending with those people.Spend some time thinking about the people you spend time with, and how they affect you. It may even be helpful to keep a ""worry diary"" that tracks when you worry most. If you find that it's right after seeing a certain person, you may decided you need to spend less time with him or her. Or, you might decide there are certain topics you don't wish to discuss with this person any more. Changing your social circle can change the way you think.  , Most worries rise from fears about the future, rather than our immediate surroundings. Focusing on you surroundings and the moment you are experiencing can be a good way to shut down worries.Some people recommend a ""stop, look, listen"" technique. In this approach, when you are worrying, stop and recognize the worry. Take a deep breath. Then, look at your surroundings. Spend five minutes focusing on the details of the world around you. As you do so, speak calmly and reassure yourself that things will work out.",1344,"['hands', 'time', 'deep breaths', 'exercise', 'meditation', 'plenty', 'social influences', 'aromatherapy', 'moment', 'imperfection', 'uncertainty', 'computer', 'worries']"

Take the crease line as the starting point, and draw the two blue coloured lines as in the photo.; , Along the line you have just made, mark point at 17 centimeter (6.7 in). At the 17 centimeter (6.7 in) mark, measure 95 degrees and mark the vertical line as seen in photo.  , Draw the black coloured lines as shown in photo. Draw a free hand curve at the bottom right side of the paper. Draw a triangle (for the dart) at the fullest part of the curve (the triangle in this tutorial is 55 degrees, and the sides are 3.5cm long). Ensure that when you fold this dart triangle in half, there is paper hanging off. Check by physically bringing the straight sides of the triangle together. Measure 5 degrees from the top line and draw the line. Fold your pattern in half along the crease line and cut it out.  , Continue to cut two pieces of lining; two pieces of iron-on interfacing; and two pieces of heavy sew-in.  , Make up your pattern for the handle tabs as shown in the photo. From this pattern cut: 2 pieces of silk; 2 pieces of lining; 2 pieces of iron-on interfacing; and 2 pieces of heavy sew-in.  , Iron the iron-on interfacing onto the wrong side of both of the silk pieces. Make a sandwich with the one of the the silk pieces (right side up) on the the bottom, a lining piece (the right side down) in the middle, and a heavy sew-in piece on the top. Pin the sandwich and stitch together leaving a 10 centimeter (3.9 in) gap in one of the long edges. Make notches into the 'V' of the handle tab, and clip off the corners. This will reduce bulk and make for a smoother result when you turn the handle tab right side out. Turn the tab right side out through the gap and press. Repeat for the other bag handle tab.  , Clip off the corners of the point as shown.  ,, Take one of the handle tabs and fold it in half (make sure the half or the tab which has the gap in the bottom of it is facing outwards (the exterior side (not the lining) of the bag - this will be sewn shut later.) On the tab half which will face the inside of the bag, find and mark the centre of the tab and push one of magnetic snap parts into the tab so as the make two prong marks/indentations. Using a stitch ripper, make two small cuts into the markings you have just made (don't cut through both halves of the tab, just one half). Take one of the magnetic snap parts and push the prongs through the right side of the tab. Slip a metal washer over the prongs at the back of the tab and then press the prongs down away from each other.  ,, Magnetic snaps comprise of 4 parts; 2 washers, and a male and female. Find the centre of the tab, and make prong marks/an indentation by pushing a mag snap part into your fabric. Push the mag snap part into the right side of your tab and slip a washer on the back.  , Iron the iron-on interfacing onto the wrong side of both of the silk pieces (usually it would not be advised to use firm iron-on interfacing on silk but in this case we want the interfacing to make the silk more crunchy because we are after those 'sculptural qualities' for this bag). Take one of the silk exterior pieces (right side up), lay it on the heavy sew-in interlining piece, and treat as one layer. With the silk right side up fold the dart triangle in half and and stitch the dart (with 1 cm seam allowance) as shown in the photo.   Repeat for the other 3 darts. Sew the 4 darts in the lining pieces in the same way. Fold dart triangles and sew dart as shown in image.  , Pin the 2 exterior halves (with wrong sides out) together. Whilst pinning together, ensure that the dart lines meet each other (so that the darts will run smoothly from the front of the bag to the back). Measure 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) down from both top edge corners and mark. Starting from one of the markings sew around the sides and bottom of the exterior and stop at the other marking. Turn right side out.   Sew lining bag bag in the same way. Except that you must leave a 15 centimeter (5.9 in) gap in the bottom and do not turn the lining bag right side out. Measure and mark 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) down from the top edge on both sides. Sew by following the blue arrow.  , With the right side out, slip the exterior bag into the lining bag. The right sides of the lining and the exterior bag should now be touching each other. Make the 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) markings as in Step 5.   Slip exterior bag into lining bag as shown. Measure and mark 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) down from the top edge on the left and right sides of the lining. Sew by following the blue arrow.  , Pop the lining into the exterior bag and smooth everything out. Stitch the gap in the lining shut by tucking the raw edges into the hole and top stitching for a neat finish.   Pull it through. Stitch a hole in the lining, and press. This should be the result (after a spot of ironing!)  , Mark the centre top edge of the flap with a pin. Pleat the flap as shown in the picture. Hold the pleats in place with paper clips. Important - ensure that after pleating, the flap is the same length as the handle tab casing. This part will take a bit of fiddling and adjustment, so take your time and get it right at this stage. Hand sew a few stitches to keep the pleats in place. Repeat with the other flap.   Look at the front view of pleats. Notice how the outer edges bend upwards? Don't worry about that, just make sure that when you place one of the handle tabs over your pleats (position the tab on the blue line which is 1cm down from the centre top edge) everything lines up nicely - in other words, the bag sides flow up into the handle tabs to create a smooth line. To get the width of the pleats right will take a bit of fiddling about (it would be good to have a cup of tea handy for this bit!). Secure pleats with some paper clips and then with a few hand stitches. This is how the pleats should look from the lining side.  , Take one of the handle tabs and fold it in half over the pleated purse flap and slip one of the handles onto the tab. Ensure that the mag snap is facing inwards! Because there a quite a few layers to sew through, and this stage is all about positioning the tab correctly over the pleats, we are not going to trust pins to hold everything in place. Instead we are going to glue the tabs onto the pleats and then sew - this will save you a lot of grief!   Slip a handle onto the tab. Apply some fabric glue to the lining side of the handle tab and the top edge of the pleats. Wait for a minute or two and then bond pressing the edges firmly. Repeat for the lining side of the pleats. Be careful to line everything up as best as you can, ensuring that the bottom of the edges of the tab are even on both the lining side and the exterior side of the bag (in other words, one edge should not hang lower than the other). Make sure that you get a nice straight diagonal line from the sides of the bag through to the handle tabs.  , When the glue has dried sew the handle tab onto the pleats 2 or 3 mm from the edge. Ensure that you catch all of the layers as you sew (which, if you positioned everything correctly earlier, everything will be fine). This is where you will sew the gap in the bottom of the tab shut. Take your time! Repeat for the other handle tab.  , Go slowly! It's a bit bulky and awkward but if you take you time you should get a nice straight/ish line. You will find out here that gluing it first just a brilliant idea!

You miss out on key nutrients over the course of the diet. Most people immediately put the weight back on after concluding the fad diet as well., The simple act of burning roughly 500 more calories per day that you take in can lead to a loss of 1-2 pounds over the course of a week.By counting calories, you can more accurately compare how many you take in on a daily basis versus how many you burn while exercising.   There is a limit to how many calories you can cut safely, though. For instance, if you plan to exercise for one hour per day to see quick results, you should still at least 1,200 calories per day and no less.For comparison purposes, most daily values are based on a 2,000-calorie per day diet.  , To see quick results in a healthy manner, focus on foods like veggies, eggs, soy products, skinless poultry breasts, fish, shellfish, seeds, nuts, pulses, legumes, low fat dairy foods, and 95% lean meat.Choose healthy carbs like long-grain rice, quinoa, oats, and barley. Eat fruit as a treat. A good variety of these options will help you maintain nutrients while cutting out unnecessary starches, sugars, and animal fats.Seems simple, but it’s easier said than done.   Most serving suggestions will be based on a 2,000-calorie per day diet. However, to see fast, safe results with your weight-loss efforts, you should tailor your calorie intake based on your exercise regimen. Never drop below the daily calorie intake highlighted in Step 2.  , Some people mistakenly believe that eating too much of healthy options is still healthy. Even when eating well, you still need to control portion sizes. To get a better idea of correct portion sizes when talking about a “serving size” of healthy options, consider the following.A portion size of a complex carb such as vegetables, grains, and fruit should be the size of your fist. A portion size of protein should fit in the palm of your hand. A portion size of nuts fits in the palm of your hand.  , Unnecessary snacking and sugary drinks are the sources of more daily calories than most people realize. Cut out as many of these as possible. Sadly, this also means desserts.   If you do need to snack, have vegetables instead of sweets.Actively try to eat only from a plate at the dinner table whenever possible. Mindless snacking in front of the refrigerator or on the couch adds up., You can cut out plenty of calories each day by replacing caloric drinks with water. In addition to keeping you hydrated, drinking lots of water can also help you feel full, which will cut down on snacking and other habits that way curb your weight-loss progress.This includes alcoholic beverages as well, which often average even more calories than soft drinks.Drink at least eight glasses of water each day, preferably cold water.  , The type of exercise you do and how hard you push yourself will depend upon how active you are before beginning your efforts. However, you should aim to exercise for an hour per day.You’ll quickly see a difference in how hard you can push yourself by keeping up a daily regimen.  , While strength-training regimens are an important part of a fitness routine, they don’t lead to the calorie burning you want for fast results.Cardio is your best bet when you're trying to burn calories fast. Try pliometrics or an interval workout to get high calorie burns while maintaining your muscle mass., When it comes to burning lots of calories fast, cardio is your friend. You don’t have to push yourself to the extreme for the entire hour of exercise, though. For the best results, try to break a sweat during your warm up, then keep yourself sweating for the entire hour.If you have a chronic condition or a lot of weight to lose, check with your primary care physician before taking on a serious physical exercise routine.Ensure that your physician thinks you’re healthy enough for the activity.  , An hour per day is a great way to burn out on a single exercise. The key to maintaining is to vary your exercise routine enough to keep it interesting.Mixing resistance moves with cardio will keep your heart rate up and break the boredom. Cardio means that your heart rate is elevated to 70-85% of your maximum heart rate for a sustained period of time. That means that any movement, including sets of squats or push-ups, can be included in a 60 minute cardio workout.   Add a few intervals of push ups, sit ups, lunges, squats, burpees, jumping jacks, or skipping to walking, hiking, cycling, swimming, skating, jogging, stair climbing, or dancing. Consider also trying these other exercises that burn roughly 600 calories per hour in the target MHR:Cycling Rowing Swimming    , To maximize gains (or losses as it were), keep your heart rate in the optimal range for fat and calorie burning. The range for steady-state fat burning is between 55-75% of your maximum heart rate (MHR). The range of 70-85% of your MHR is considered to be the cardiac training zone. For best results, spend half of your exercise time in the 55-75% range and half in the 70-85% range. This will allow you to get the calorie burn that you want to support your faster weight loss.You can determine your MHR by subtracting your age from 220. Multiply this number by 0.55 and 0.75 to find your steady-state fat burning range.Multiply your MHR by .70 and .85 to get your cardiac training zone range. Use a heart monitor to gauge if you’re staying in your ranges during your exercise.  , Interval training refers to the process of alternating between high-intensity bursts and more moderate intensity throughout the routine.When using a heart monitor, you can easily introduce interval training by pushing yourself from the low end of your target range toward the higher end for several minutes at a time.   Building stamina for interval training takes time. Begin slowly with fewer high-intensity bursts with a shorter duration.The emphasis should always be on safety, so don’t overdo it.  , You’ll be much more likely to maintain your workout routine if you schedule and log your daily workouts.Looking back at the number of hours you’ve logged at the end of each week will also motivate you to keep going.   Weigh yourself daily as part of your log as well. You’ll feel even more motivated once you start seeing results on the scale.  , You’ll have an easier time avoiding sugary snacks and other junk food if you don’t keep it in the house to begin with. Clean out your refrigerator and pantry to cut down on any temptations.  , To reduce the risk of snacking and other counterproductive activities, stay busy even when you’re not exercising., You’ll have a much more difficult time controlling your calorie intake if you eat out all the time. Cook at home where you can control the portion size and exactly what goes into the preparation of meals.  , In addition to eating well and exercising, sleep is beneficial to your metabolism. You’ll naturally be tired while burning more calories than you take in each day as well. Give your body the rest it needs to maximize your results.

Instead, the cat has to be convinced that she'll benefit from an action. For example, maybe she'll give up her nap if you offer her her favorite treat. Don't be offended if she decides not to be persuaded. By nature, cats often choose to remain aloof or unpredictable.Your cat will have a harder time accepting you if you're chaotic and noisy. Cats dislike stress, noise, or a lot of activity. Your cat will accept you faster if you're calm and relaxed around her.; , A good way to make your cat comfortable is to give the cat their own space. A comfortable, warm place to sleep, eat, play and excrete/urinate. Another point is to look in pet stores and maybe even ask staff about cat shelves. These can be nailed to a wall in whatever position suits you and your cat so they have somewhere to look over the room and feel safe up there.  , There will be times when your cat feels insecure, scared, or anxious. Give her plenty of hiding places to go to when feeling frightened, like a closet or spot under the bed. It's fine to know where her hiding place is, but don't force your cat out of it unless you absolutely have to. You should also make sure your cat can access high perches (like window ledges, furniture, or a high cat scratch platform) and toys for when she's bored and wants to look around or play.   Immediately creating a safe and secure place is important. If you're trying to gain the trust of a new cat, keep her in one room so she can get familiar with her territory without feeling overwhelmed.You should also take care to set the litter box in a private corner of the room. It should be away from anything noisy, like a dryer) and she should feel protected when she uses it (the 2 walls will offer this protection if it's in a corner).  , Feed your cat on a regular basis so she understands that you provide food and shelter. When you set the food down, talk in a soft sing-song voice so she starts recognizing your voice and associating it with something positive, like mealtime. When your cat comes over to eat, back up and give her plenty of space. If you'd like to keep her company, sit down on the floor so you aren't towering over her, which could intimidate her.   Make sure your cat can easily get to the food and water dishes. If she's shy, set them within reach of her hiding place, so she doesn't feel too traumatized or stressed by going out to get them.  , Your cat may have trouble relaxing or feeling calm in a new environment. You can purchase a synthetic cat pheromone product (like Feliway) to diffuse in the room. This is a synthetic version of the chemical messengers a mother cat gives off to make her kittens feel safe and secure. The pheromone can reduce overall stress and can help the new cat settle in faster.You might also consider getting your cat used to your scent as something familiar. This will help her recognize you when you start to make physical contact. For example, you might try letting your cat sleep with one of your old T-shirts that has your scent on it., A cat might be frightened of its new surroundings, regardless of how cozy you've made it. This is especially true if the cat was abused or neglected. Never yell at the cat when you notice her doing something she shouldn't. Chances are, she's just exploring her new environment. Instead, use a calm soothing voice to praise her for any good behavior she shows.   If your cat still seems frightened of her new surroundings, make sure that you're not scaring her. Never sneak up on your cat or make sudden movements that may catch her off guard. Cats that have been abused are more likely to be skittish, when you surprise them., Always let your cat come to you, rather than approach her. If you clearly see that your cat appears tense and is watching you intently (standing, tail stiff, pupils dilated), do nothing. Sit very still, preferably with your eyes closed. You'll be less of a threat this way and the cat will get used to your presence. On the other hand, if your cat is ready for contact, she may:Stay in your sight after she finishes eating, instead of running for cover Take a few steps towards you Sit near you and wash (which shows she's relaxed) Sit with her back to you (which shows she trusts you)  , There are several ways you can appear less intimidating and make your cat feel more comfortable. Lie down, if space allows. Being on her level keeps you from towering over her. Avoid eye contact, since direct eye contact is a challenge or threat display in cat language.Instead, turn your head aside and look away.   If you wear glasses, you may even want to take them off since the lenses can look like large eyes to cats. This may look like a threat.  , Don't feel like you have to rush things. Eventually, your cat will begin trusting and approaching you. When this happens on a regular basis, the cat will then voluntarily bump her head against your hand or body. This bumping puts her scent onto you and shows that she's accepting you.   You can encourage your cat to come closer to you by offering tasty treats. Rest your arm on the floor and scatter a few treats around you. Let the cat pluck up courage to come and eat the treats. Gradually, set treats closer to you so she can approach without feeling threatened.  , Allow them to play or eat near each other. Of course, this will be a whole other process as you will have to start from a longer distance and move them closer each day. Of course it would be helpful to have someone else involved in this.  , When your cat signals (by bumping her head against you) that she's ready for more contact, you can rub her ears or chin. Take it slowly and start by just extending a single finger to rub her. Don't make any sudden movements, and as her confidence builds, you can scratch her chin.Avoid rough-housing, since cats don't like it.  , When your cat starts approaching you regularly and purrs when you cuddle her, you can stop lying down around her. Sit up and cuddle her. She may even start to sit on your lap, which shows she completely trusts you.   Make playtime a regular part of your daily routine. This will strengthen your cat's bond towards you and she'll expect this attention from you. Studies have also shown health benefits for humans (such as lowered cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and less anxiety) from touching and talking with pets., This is especially important if you're rehabilitating a cat that has been abused or neglected. You may find yourself cautiously petting the cat, when all of a sudden, she bites you. This, along with surprise scratching, might mean that your cat is overwhelmed by the physical contact or affection. Give the cat some time on her own to calm down, since she's probably surprised too. Next time, avoid petting her for as long.Never punish the cat by yelling or hitting. Cats won't understand why you're hurting them. Instead, remove yourself from the situation for a while.  , So always play with them at least once a day. A good time to do this is before you go to bed. This burns their energy which will help them associate that time of night with winding down and going to sleep just as you do.

Before you start reading, decide what you are looking for. If you are in secondary school, you may want to ask your teacher for a list of suggested annotations.   Clearly annotate the thesis and key parts of the argument in an essay. Underline evidence that you find questionable. This will be useful if you want to argue that the author’s thesis is wrong. Annotations on works of literature usually identify plot, character, and theme. However, they can also include setting, vocabulary and figurative language. If you are reading for pleasure, highlight points that you found very interesting and that you might want to go back to. Consider, for example, annotating quotes that you really like and might want to use later. In addition, if you run across a big idea that changes the way you think, highlight it so that you can return to it.; , Successful annotation is only possible if you are always reading actively. Consider reading shorter works multiple times, circling things you had trouble understanding the first time., No matter what your assignment is, you will need to understand the big idea of the text. Any part of the book that seems to speak to a major idea, should be clearly marked. Consider drawing a big asterisk in the margins so that you can easily find these elements later.  , If you miss something important it can be very difficult to go back and find it. Yellow highlighter is the best way to mark text without making it hard to read. Pencil is easy to erase if you want to correct something or return the book to a pristine condition after you finish. </ref>   Pen generally isn’t recommended because a lot of pen annotations can make the text messy, but if you are going to be taking notes sparingly and want permanent reminders, pen can work.  , If you don’t want to dirty up your copy of the book with a lot of writing, place Post-it notes in the book and write comments on them. This will also make it easier to find your notes when you are done.  , Taking a yellow highlighter to important parts of the reading is the best way to mark relevant sections without making it harder to read. However, you can also circle and underline words. Consider using different annotations to identify different topics.   Most e-book readers will allow you to highlight passages. Marvin will even allow you to use multiple colors when highlighting the text., Use circles, boxes, multiple colors, and so on. The more techniques you use to annotate the text, the easier it will be to find specific types of information. You can, for example, circle vocabulary you have trouble with so you can easily skim through and find vocabulary later. How you use each type of annotation will depend upon what you need to look for in the text.   For example, you may want to circle new vocabulary, box figurative language, underline thematic statements, and place parenthesis around descriptions of setting. Most e-readers don’t allow so many different types of annotations, but some, like Clearview, offer at least a few types of annotation.You can use different color highlighters to identify text relevant to character, theme, or setting. You can also use different color highlighters to identify important statements about different characters. You can create different symbols to make it easier to identify relevant pages. For example, an asterisk in the margins or top of the page could identify pages with major parts of the argument. You can use arrows to point to quotes that you know you will use during the essay.  , Make a list that explains what each type of annotation you use means. If you are using a print out, write the key on a blank piece of paper attached to the printout. For an e-reader, write a note at the beginning of the text. The front page of a book can also be a great place to write out your index., Try to develop a method that you can use for future assignments. After several assignments, you may no longer need to use a legend to keep your annotations straight.  , Overly underlined or marked text can be hard to decode. Be sure to identify what you are looking for in advance and limit annotations to text that is relevant to your assignment. If you annotate everything, your annotations won’t help you find what you need when you review the book.Try to have a preliminary thesis as you read so that you know what quotes will be useful for your argument. Your thesis can, and probably should, change as you read. But having something at the beginning will help you identify important material.  , When you find a passage that may apply to your assignment, create brackets around the text. Then, record significant observations or ideas in the margins. If you do not want to mark up the text so much, you can write your observations on Post-it Notes or a separate piece of paper with page numbers listed.A common mistake with annotations is to underline too much and take too few notes. Your notes will help you to make important connections that you can refer to later. Otherwise, you might forget what it was that you found to be important about the underlined section. E-readers also allow you to place notes in the text of the book and sometimes to export them to your computer. Most allow you to instantly search through your notes for keywords. “Skim” allows you to include different types of notes in the text and automatically creates bibliographies with your notes., Write down predictions so that you can return to the text later and remember where you think the text was going. This can be a good way to think about how the story or argument evolves and to pick out any curve balls the author might have thrown.  , Write down page numbers and a short description for the most important parts of the book. Try to group these comments by relevant subject, like theme, character change and repetitive figurative language on your additional note pages. For a book, consider putting the index on the front page. Otherwise, write them on a separate page, or in a word file.   Keep a list of themes and important figurative elements. This is especially important if you are going to be asked to do a literary analysis or write an essay. You can write these on a separate piece of paper, or on blank page in the front of the book.List comments and page numbers under each theme. The more detailed you are, the easier it will be to write a paper and provide evidence.  , Summarize the important points of each chapter. This will make it easier to go back and find relevant material. In addition, it will force you to digest what you read. Consider writing your own title for the chapter. This will help you think about the theme and major events of each chapter.In a book, you can write this in the space between chapters. For e-books, write notes at the end of the text in the chapter. You can also write comments on a separate piece of paper or in a word file.  , When you hit parts of the book that you have trouble understanding or that you think require deeper analysis, write questions in the margins. Return to these after you finish the book to see if you can answer them. Questioning the text is a good way to produce original opinions about it., When you encounter a word that you’re having trouble with, circle it. Look it up when you can and write the definition next to it., Create a list of words that you circled. Go back and study it before you re-read the chapter. This will make it easier to understand the passage the second time.  , When you are trying to understand a process or a plot line, write down numbers on the margins. Number each step in the process as you encounter it. Then, when you go back, you can quickly identify how something happened.If, for example, you are reading a book on chemistry, you could number each step necessary to produce a chemical reaction.

You may realize that he is acting the way he is because he is overworked, because he is dealing with an unreasonable customer, or because he is just having a bad day., If you're dealing with a bully at work, it's important to remind yourself that she may be treating you badly because she is insecure about her own performance and jealous of your success or ambition. While this is no excuse for her behavior, it may help you understand your coworker., Take a minute to think about why you dislike your coworker, and make sure that it is actually because of things that this specific person has done. It can sometimes be easy to hold grudges against people because they somehow remind you of other people who you don't like., Everyone is different, and you can't expect all of your coworkers to operate exactly the way you do. Before you jump to the conclusion that your coworker is difficult or irrational, take a minute to consider what it is you are expecting of her. You may discover that you are imposing completely unrealistic expectations on your coworker., It's great to be friendly with your coworkers, and you should always try to be as nice as possible to everyone at work, but that doesn't mean that everyone is going to be your best friend. Don't let it bother you if you don't get along with a particular coworker. Instead, try to think of ways you can work together effectively even though you don't like each other., If you don't have to work directly with the difficult coworker, do you best to stay away from him.When you do need to interact with this person, keep your interactions brief and pleasant. Be professional instead of giving the person the cold shoulder or being rude. Depending on the situation, it may be best to simply ignore certain behaviors as well, even if they are exhibited by coworkers with whom you work closely. Remember, you need to pick and choose your battles.  , If you're having a problem with a coworker who you really do need to work with, try talking to the person openly about the issue. Make sure to communicate what the problem is, listen to her perspective, and offer your own suggestions for resolving the problem.You don't need to be afraid about bringing up an issue for fear of hurting your coworker's feelings; you just need to be diplomatic. Try to keep your conversation directed at the specific issue at hand, instead of making it about your coworker as a person. For example, instead of saying, ""You need to get your act together and work harder or we're going to miss our deadline,"" say, ""I'd like to talk to you about what we can do to get that project you're working on finished sooner."", It may be that your difficult coworker simply has a different style of communication than you do, which can make it difficult for the two of you to understand each other. Make sure to communicate to your coworker if you feel that there is something he needs to do to improve your working relationship. You also need to be willing to step in and do your part.Avoid accusing your coworker of anything. For example, instead of saying, ""You never give me enough time to prepare for presentations,"" say, ""I work best when I know about a presentation two days in advance. Can you try to let me know by then?"" Don't take offense if your coworker offers you some constructive criticism in return. Do your best to learn from it, assuming it is reasonable.  , If you have a coworker who is constantly bringing other people down with her negative attitude, let her know how you feel about it. Everyone has different ways of venting frustration, and she may not have any idea how her negative attitude affects you.If you don't want to confront her directly, try responding to your negative coworker with an abundance of positivity. She will most likely get the hint that you don't like her negative energy.  , In some circumstances, the best thing you can do is to tell a superior, such as a manager or your company's HR department, about your coworker's unacceptable behavior. The appropriateness of this option will depend upon the unique situation and your office culture. Make sure you take a minute to think about whether the situation is really worth reporting before you go running to your boss.Before reporting a coworker's behavior to your superiors, you should make sure that you are doing so because you believe the behavior is genuinely harmful to the company and/or employees, and not because you are feeling angry or want to get someone in trouble. You should also ask yourself if the problem could be more easily resolved if you confronted your coworker about it directly. Keep in mind that if you go over his head, he will likely feel threatened.  , You have the right to feel safe and respected at work. If a coworker's behavior is simply unprofessional, make sure he knows that you won't stand for it. You can try telling him that you will report his behavior to your manager or to HR if it happens again, but if you say this, you have to follow through.It's important not to let the bully see that his actions are affecting you the way he wants them to. Be strong and don't react emotionally., It's a good idea to keep a record of your coworker's bad behavior, just in case it gets to the point that you feel you need to report it.Keep hard evidence like emails or voicemails if you can. If you don't have anything like that, simply keep a log of your coworker's bad behavior.  , Everyone gets upset for different reasons, and it is important to keep in mind that just because a coworker upset you, does not mean that it was her intention to do so. Try to take a deep breath and let go of the conflict if possible.If you still feel personally insulted by something your coworker did or said to you, even after you've had some time to think about it, try explaining how you feel.  , You don't want your other coworkers or your boss to think you are whiny or a troublemaker, so don't go running to others with every little problem. Before you report something, make sure you can't handle the issue on your own.Even if you have a perfectly valid reason to complain, keep in mind that your negativity can be contagious and bring your coworkers down. Try to be a source of positive energy in the office., It may be tempting to spread gossip about the coworker you don't like, but it is always best not to get involved. If another coworker is spreading gossip, just walk away or tell him that you're not interested in hearing about it.Avoid talking about anything that is not directly related to work with coworkers who are known gossipers., You may be able to get jealous or overly competitive coworkers to work with you if you just acknowledge the role they play on your team. Treat everyone with respect, praise the achievements of the whole team, and show them all that you value their input., If your coworker is the type to get overly stressed out and overreact about everything, respond to him calmly and rationally. Don't let the stress wear off on you.  , Instead of trying to argue with a coworker who doesn't want to hear your opinion, try acknowledging his point of view and asking him to explain his ideas further. This might make him more open to having a dialogue with you., If everyone in your department knows exactly who is responsible for doing what, then you won't have to worry about a coworker who isn't pulling her weight or refuses to take responsibility for her actions. Try to encourage clear communication with your whole team., You don't want to end up saying something you regret in the heat of the moment, so if your coworker has said something that really upsets you, always take a moment to cool down before responding.Keep in mind that if your coworker is purposefully upsetting you, he wants you to lose your cool, so don't give in.

Anxiety, stress (emotional, mental, or physical), changes in sleep patterns, activity levels, and even changes in weather can all trigger migraines. Some people experience only one trigger, while others can have several before developing a migraine.Usually, your migraine triggers will remain the same over time, so once you identify them you can avoid them or learn to cope.; , Write down everything you eat and drink, what the weather is like, what physical activities you do, how well you slept, if you're stressed, and if you're menstruating. Do this until you can see a pattern emerge about what triggers your migraines. If you get them, be sure to write down any warning signs (known as auras) that come before you get a migraine.Track this information for as long as you like or until you've had several migraines. This way, you'll be able to use the information from the days leading up to the migraines to determine your triggers.  , Warning signs (auras) are what you experience right before you get a migraine. It can help to write these in your daily journal. Auras can be visual (like flashes of light or blind spots), auditory (like ringing in your ears), or physical (like tingling in the arms or legs). You may also have problems speaking.Some people get warning signs in the days before getting a migraine. These prodromes are unique and might include constipation, food cravings, irritability, frequent uncontrolled yawning, hyperactivity, depression and stiffness or discomfort in the neck.  , Unfortunately, you may have a migraine trigger that you can't avoid or control. For example, you can't change the weather, but if you know your migraines are triggered by weather changes, you can prepare for them by making certain no other triggers are around when that weather changes from dry and warm to cold and rainy. Focus on avoiding the triggers you can control and learn to cope with the triggers you can't avoid.   When you know you can't avoid a trigger try to cope by spending some time relaxing in a dimly lit room, putting an ice pack on your neck or head, and massaging your head.  , If you suspect a particular food is triggering your migraines, check your journal. If you developed a migraine within 24 hours of eating the food and you notice that that food triggers migraines more than half of the time you eat it, then it is a trigger. Try to avoid eating trigger foods. Common trigger foods include:Foods with nitrates: processed foods, cured meats, deli meat Foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG): Chinese food, soy sauce, food seasonings Alcohol: especially wine and champagne Caffeine: coffee, soft drinks, energy drinks Foods with food additives and artificial sweeteners  , If your trigger is a medication you're taking, continue to take it until you can talk to your doctor. Your doctor may be able to prescribe an alternative medication or lower dosage. If your migraines are triggered by hormonal shifts, your doctor may be able to give some advice particular to your situation (especially if you're pregnant, have an irregular period, or have had a hysterectomy).If you get infrequent migraines (less than 9 a month), try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever designed for migraines at the first sign of a trigger., Unfortunately, most people who are sensitive to light triggers react most strongly to sunlight. If you find that going from dim, interior lights to bright outdoor sun triggers a migraine, try putting on sunglasses before going out. Filtered or fluorescent lights can also trigger migraines. You may want to switch to incandescent bulbs or use curtains instead of blinds.If the flickering light of an older computer triggers your migraines, wrap the screen with an anti-glare screen.  , Noise is another sensory stimulus that triggers migraines. The noise can be very loud or just repetitive. Use your journal to determine if specific noises or situations trigger your migraines. For example, listening to music through headphones or listening to the music while you're on hold during a phone call could trigger your migraines. Cope with noise triggers by going somewhere quiet.If you can't go somewhere quiet to get away from the noise, always carry earplugs with you so you can at least try to mute the noise until you can get away from it.  , Sleep is a well-known trigger for migraines and headaches. To reduce your risk for migraines, get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night. But, try not to oversleep or sleep in quick short shifts since these could increase the severity of your headaches. It may take up to 4 weeks of regular sleep before you notice a reduction in migraines.People with migraines are 2 to 8 times more likely to develop sleep disorders than people who don't get migraines.  , Being dehydrated can easily trigger migraines. This is because your blood volume drops causing less blood and oxygen to be delivered to your brain. Your brain might even be more sensitive to pain. Men should drink 13 cups of liquid a day and women should drink 9 cups. You can drink water, juice, or tea. Caffeine and alcohol do not count towards your daily intake.Pay special attention to drinking enough water during the summer. Research shows that migraine risk increases by 8% for every 9 degree increase in temperature.  , The neurons in the brains of people who get migraines are more sensitive and easily excited. When you smoke tobacco, these neurons can become hyper-excited which triggers your migraine. Research has shown that smoking more than five cigarettes a day can trigger a migraine.Ask your doctor about cessation programs. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a medication or offer an effective strategy to help you quit.  , Some people experience weekend headaches or tend to get their migraines only after the work week. This may be because your weekly routine of sleeping, eating, and consuming caffeine may be very different on your days off. Since what you eat, drink, and how much you sleep can all trigger migraines, try to keep to your schedule even on your days off.This doesn't mean that you can't enjoy your weekend. For example, just because you wake up at 6am doesn't mean you have to wake up at 6am on the weekends too. You should just avoid large differences in routine (like waking up around noon).  , Since stress and anxiety can trigger your migraine, teach your body how to respond to stress. Try a relaxation method like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization as a form of meditation. Coping with anxiety can prevent or treat your migraine.Choose a place that's comfortable and where you won't be interrupted. Make sure you can feel relaxed and close your eyes. Remember a favorite place of yours and try to picture it in your mind. Breathe deeply as you consider the details of that place and feel yourself relax.

The more unlike partners are, the more likely the relationship may experience infidelity. Factors such as education level, personality, and lifestyle can influence the fidelity of the relationship.Reflect on your relationship and what factors may have come between you that you have ignored. Sometimes you may really love someone, but cannot manage to meaningfully connect.; , Some women feel like the role of “mother” or “provider” or “activity partner” take over, when they want to be “girlfriend” or “wife” or “lover”. If she feels like she is acting out a practical role and not an intimate connection, she may feel unfulfilled.It’s easy to get in the swing of things and let the intimate connection go. Ask yourself if you’ve been treating your girlfriend in a certain role. Have you shown your appreciation for her in what she does for you and the relationship? Do you tell her and show her your attraction? Have you told her you love her?  , You may find out about the cheating from your girlfriend or from a friend. If she confronts you honestly, then listen to her. If you found out through someone else, consider this person’s credibility before confronting your girlfriend. If you think you have the truth, confront your girlfriend, no matter how painful it may feel. It is best to know the truth.If you’re the one bringing up the topic, decide how you want to approach your girlfriend. Set aside some time with her and try and approach the discussion calmly. Come prepared and write questions you have for your girlfriend. Tell her you are concerned and want to truthfully know what’s happened. Ask about what happened, how the situation occurred, how long it’s been happening, how much time has elapsed since it stopped, and if anything is wrong with the relationship. Encourage honesty and openness, even if it hurts., Perhaps you may want to express your anger and rage prior to discussing the cheating with your girlfriend. Write down all the anger, hurt and frustration you feel-- without fearing judgment from yourself or someone else-- then burn it. When you are ready to discuss the cheating with your girlfriend, don’t directly accuse her. Use “I” statements as much as possible.This is a time for you to express your feelings, not place blame.Instead of making her responsible for your feelings by saying, “I can’t believe you would hurt me like this” say, “I feel really hurt by your actions.”  , Some people are more prone to cheat than others. We’ve all heard the phrase “once a cheater, always a cheater”, which reflects traits associated with one person. Individual factors can include personal values, moral compass, empathy, and impulsivity.Recognize if you knew that your girlfriend has cheated before or has a reputation of cheating. She may be a “serial cheater”.  , If she is angry at you for something in the relationship, she may use sex or cheating to get revenge.Your girlfriend may cheat on you to get back at you for something, or to intentionally cause you pain.   Ask your girlfriend whether the cheating was used for revenge or to make a point.  , Sometimes people who would normally not cheat end up cheating. This can be due to environmental factors such as being around many attractive people, or having a job that involves touching or one-on-one discussions with people. A partner can be very happy in a relationship, yet get caught up in a situation against better judgment.Ask your girlfriend what happened. She may be willing to say she got caught up in a situation. This can be especially true if you believe the relationship to be happy and she does too. Remember that people do make mistakes, this just happens to be a very large one.  , Some people use alcohol to escape their problems. For others, it may be too painful to confront problems (either individual or relationship problems) and may instead escape through other methods, like cheating. Instead of facing problems, she may use the thrill of cheating to feel better, while not fully considering the consequences.Ask about the problems your partner is facing, and if the problems can be worked through together. Ask her if there are things she wants to say or express that she feels shame or embarrassment in bringing up.  , Some people stay with a partner to feel supported or loved, yet have difficulty letting go when they realize they are not in love. Your girlfriend may have realized that she was not in love, but stayed to get certain needs met. Or, her needs may have changed but she was scared to let go of the relationship.Have a serious discussion about what is best and if the relationship needs to end. Ask if there’s a part of her that doesn’t want to be in the relationship.  , If you feel like the damage is irreparable, or that you cannot ever trust your girlfriend again, break up. Know that moving forward as a couple will be painful, and you may have constant reminders or triggers of the infidelity come up for you. Consider whether you can move forward with her, or if you will be better off breaking it off. Both are painful choices.It’s not fair to your partner to lock down her life, to go through all of her private life (texts, emails, phone calls, etc) if you know you can never trust her again; it will be punishing both of you.  , If you decide to stay together, find ways to reconnect in new, meaningful ways. Perhaps you still love and care for each other but struggled to express it to each other. It is possible that other factors of life began to take importance over your relationship. Together, determine to contribute to the relationship in meaningful ways. Realize that it’s not just the job of your girlfriend to make things new; you will need to contribute to creating a new foundation as well.For more information about moving forward after cheating, check out How to Handle a Cheating Partner.  , Especially if you continue the relationship, learn to forgive your girlfriend. Forgiving your partner does not mean she gets a free pass, or that her behavior was okay. Forgiveness takes the focus away from the offense and acts to free yourself from the pain of the situation. You may feel like a victim or powerless after hearing the news of cheating; forgiveness allows you to reclaim power over your own emotions. Forgive your partner in a way that allows you to feel free from the powerlessness, to validate your own emotions, and then let them go.Even if you decide to break up with your girlfriend, holding onto pain and hurt will not serve you. Let it go. For more information, check out How to Forgive a Cheater.  , Talk to your partner about what constitutes infidelity and create clear boundaries. While most people agree that sex is considered cheating, others may consider flirting, touching, kissing or intimate conversations cheating. Be clear on discussing boundaries with your partner.Some people choose to be in open relationships, which means that intimacy can be shared outside of the relationship. If you and your partner choose to have an open relationship, be clear on the boundaries of that as well. Cheating can still happen within open relationships, and trust is important.  , If you agree that the relationship needs work and that you want to stick with it but don’t know where to start, seek counseling. You can attend couples counseling to help you ways to rebuild trust, find ways to cope with the betrayal, and build a new relationship together.For more information, check out How to Choose a Therapist.

Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds (sing ""Happy Birthday"" to yourself twice) before rinsing and drying your hands. This is especially important to do after being around someone who's already sick.When leaving a public bathroom after washing your hands, take care to push the door open with your foot or use a paper towel to open the door.; , As an adult, you should get between seven to nine hoursof quality, uninterrupted sleep every night to prevent disease. This will improve the function of your immune system and help your body cope with stress and emotional control. It's important to establish a regular sleep cycle. In fact, studies have shown a higher rate of cancer among people whose sleep/wake cycle is disrupted (like night shift workers).Teenagers should get eight to 10 hours of sleep, school-age children may need between 10 and 13 hours, and toddlers need between 11 and 14 hours of sleep.If you suffer from insomnia, the poor quality of sleep affects how you function during the day and can keep your body's immune system from properly fighting off disease., While no vaccine exists for the common cold, it may be available in the future.Fortunately, a flu vaccine is created every fall for the upcoming flu season. It's highly recommended that you get the vaccination to prevent getting the flu.Every fall, the Centers for Disease Control creates the annual flu vaccine based on the flu strains they believe will be prevalent that season. Getting the shot doesn't mean you won't get the flu, but it does reduce your chance of catching the flu.  , Get in the habit of not touching your eyes, nose or mouth. These are easy ways to spread germs. You should also clean and disinfect areas of your home that get a lot of use like the bathroom, kitchen, and door knobs.General recommendations, stay home until symptom free or 24 hours without fever. Not only will this give you a better chance to rest, but it may prevent the spread of disease to others., Many dietary supplements are not studied as rigorously as prescription medications, so there is little to no scientific proof that they work — most evidence is anecdotal. In addition, they are not regulated by the FDA.This means there is no assurance of the strength of the supplement or the purity of the ingredients, which can make it difficult to figure out proper dosage . As such, you should always discuss supplements with your doctor before you begin taking any.   Some supplements may interact negatively with other medications or even other supplements, which could potentially have life-threatening effects.It is possible to take too much of a supplement, including vitamins. For example, let's consider zinc supplementation. For disease prevention, you should take 50mg of zinc a day. If you're already ill, take 150mg to 175mg in order to reduce the duration and severity of a cold. A major study showed that rates of pneumonia dropped significantly when zinc supplements were added to the study group's diet.Zinc is an essential trace element that your body needs to fight infection. Since zinc deficiency is widespread, it's important to add it to your diet. You can also get zinc from eating oysters, lobster, beef, wheat germ, spinach, and nuts.  , Talk with your doctor about adding a specialized probiotic supplement to your diet. Probiotics are microorganisms naturally found in your intestines. Studies have shown that they can improve your immune system and may decrease the duration and severity of colds.While you can take oral probiotic supplements, the following are also good sources of probiotics:Sauerkraut, curtido, or kimchi Kvass, kefir Yogurt Aged cheeses (like Roquefort or Gruyere) Kombucha Pickles Miso  , Take 300mg of echinacea by mouth for one week if you're already feeling ill. While some believe that taking echinacea can prevent colds or the flu, other studies argue against its effectiveness.Another study has suggested that echinacea decreases the duration of a cold by half a day to four days.If you're unsure about whether to add echinacea, ask your doctor to advise you.  ,   Good food sources of vitamin D include egg yolks, oily fish (such as salmon, tuna, and sardines), and fortified foods like milk, soy milk, and orange juice.Dietary recommendations for vitamin D intake for ages 9-70 years of age averages around 600 units per day.  , Though it has long been considered a ""must"" for boosting your immune system, there is actually insufficient evidence to prove that vitamin C prevents colds or improves your immune system.There is, however, some evidence to suggest that taking vitamin C while sick with the common cold can slightly decrease the duration of illness., Both the cold and flu can cause coughing, sore throat, and, in some cases, fever. Fever (over 100.4°F or 38 °C) as a cold symptom is more common in children, while fevers due to flu are usually greater than 101°F or 38.3°C. If you have a cold, you may also experience nasal congestion and runny nose. On the other hand, if you have the flu, you may notice body aches (myalgia), headaches, and shaking.The symptoms of a cold usually last one week on average. If they last longer or worsen, you may be developing a secondary infection like an ear infection, sinus infection, or bronchitis.  , The common cold is easily spread by coming into contact with infected mucous (passed orally or nasally). It only takes a few days for the disease to incubate, making it likely that adults will get approximately one cold a year, while children under two will get six colds a year. The flu is also spread through direct contact with infected secretions or airborne droplets that are passed through normal breathing or coughing. For example, you might get it by inhaling the disease around an infected person who's coughing.It is important for everyone to practice ""respiratory etiquette,"" which includes covering your mouth and nose with sneezing, excellent hand hygiene, and staying home when sick. Infected people should consider wearing a mask to prevent spreading the illness. Flu season typically lasts from late fall through the end of winter. You are at an increased risk of getting a cold if you are under physical or mental stress, or have a child or elderly adult who attends daycare or lives in a skilled nursing facility.  , If you have cold symptoms that worsen or don't improve after ten days, get a medical examination. You may be experiencing a secondary infection. If you have flu symptoms and are at risk for complications, you should see your doctor. Risk factors for flu complications include:Being over 50 Being under two Being pregnant Having a weakened immune system (from chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, have received an organ transplant, or other medical treatments) Having signs of pneumonia (such as labored breathing, chest pain, coughing up green or yellow mucus, and fever)",1185,"['flu', 'disease transmission', 'vitamin c', 'food', 'doctor', 'restful sleep', 'beneficial effect', 'echinacea', 'little exposure', 'hands', 'common cold', 'pills', 'immune system.people', 'practice good hygiene', 'supplements', 'vitamin d.', 'symptoms', 'risk factors', 'plenty', 'flu shot', 'body', 'research', 'medical attention', 'probiotics', 'sunlight']"
"['start at the beginning and spend a little time considering the meditation format', 'find a quiet peaceful place and relax into a meditation posture', 'turn your attention to the mind once you feel more relaxed and note specifically how it is feeling now', 'take your time and let go of any events that cause you distress', 'continue to observe the mental states that arise in the mind', 'to develop the mind further', 'refine and expand the scope of what you are aware of in regards to day to day activities', 'keep practicing this until you can see the interaction parts easily', 'to develop the meditation further', 'keep looking for tension in the mind as a primary target', 'that way you can get to the heart of the matter']",How to Practice Mindfulness of Mental States," This is in order to get some familiarity with what is involved in order to set yourself some guidelines, boundaries or an idea of what your intention is. In a nutshell, the aim of the meditation is to become familiar with how the mind works as well as being able to identify everything that comes and goes. Once the practitioner is more clear in their mind what they are looking at, they can then investigate the merit of the mental state and whether it should be bulked up or valued (such as a sense of calmness, clarity, happiness or goodwill), or let go of (such as tension, a chattering mind, strong emotions or unhappy memories).; , The Do Mindful Meditation page looks at the four types, but any are suitable - sitting, standing, walking or lying down. Focus your attention on something, such as the breath or feelings in order to relax but also to build up the awareness & focus to be mindful. It's typically best for beginner practitioners to be aware of the small, basic and easy parts of the mind, body or breath, or anything that is most evident but is also relaxing to focus on. It may take some time before you are able to do this in day to day circumstances for the more subtle movements, however the more you practice and practice refining your focus it will get easier and quicker that you learn things. A beginner practitioner may find the experience is easier after practicing a meditation type such as compassion, equanimity or goodwill, as the mind already has a pleasant and peaceful state of mind to begin observing.  , You can use any words in the mind you wish to be able to identify what's going on. There is a host of things you may focus on, such as:   Mental tension, or relaxed feelings, or being focused, or mentally tired. Thought chains, random thoughts or stream of consciousness thinking. Reactions to sounds, feelings and other disturbances. Specific subject thoughts that the mind is solely interested in. Emotions such feeling happy, bored, frustrated etc. Desires, intentions, motivations or urges. The point about this section to observe mental phenomena only once the practitioner is more calm and relaxed is a beginner practitioner may flood themselves with awareness of more thoughts and feelings that they can cope with. At the same time, it reduces the likelihood of seeing many strong or unsettling emotions. Eventually the practitioner builds up experience to deal with more difficult cases, but only after there is some familiarity with the mind generally At this stage, avoid getting involved with the topic or theme, or judging and commenting on it and instead, study what is going on before you attempt to change it, just like learning the layout of the land before you go exploring it.  , An excellent analogy to consider is a security guard who lets hundred of people pass him every hour but doesn't stop them, but has to be aware for the gatecrashers or dangerous people whom he does stop. The aim of the game is to watch the mind over time, how it changes, how it acts, reacts and moves Avoid looking for too many details at this stage. There is actually nothing to stop you at all, but you might get information overload or your awareness just will wear out very quickly if you have not much experience in holding an object of focus for a long time (such as more than 10 minutes without distraction). Test your limits and work into expanding them by gently adding a little more awareness each time.  , Move to the more subtle and diverse objects when you feel you are able to, or when they are more apparent. The practitioner often knows for themselves when it doesn't seem difficult anymore to be aware of the basics. At each stage, still endeavour not to get involved in the thoughts or feelings, but to simply be observant. If something arises that is very strong, then the option is to be aware of it and accept its presence, but still stay detached from it. Often strong emotions make a practitioner get lost in the thought chain, or causes them great unease, so staying detached keeps it in view like seeing a tiger in the bushes. Once you feel more able to deal with the thought, you can then let go of the thought, or turn your attention to investigating what it is. You can ask yourself ""Can I live without this thought?"" (or whatever it is that is causing you stress), in order to help letting go.  , Whenever you are in or outside of the meditation room, observe whatever mental states are associated to it. There are many examples such as: ""I'm thinking about work and the mind feeling worn out"" or ""I'm driving, I'm late and feeling annoyed at that red light"" or ""the mind has put that thought down now and there is a feeling of relaxing"". Continue to the next activity or change in the mind when you can do that and it seems straightforward and easy. Examine that the area where the traps are and how to avoid getting trapped by refraining from being drawn into, or distracted by the subject. The trap is when you have become involved and start wanting something to be, to happen, or oppositely not be, or not happen. You have to work harder to get awareness and that sense of detachment back if you get involved. This monitoring activity in itself is not the goal finished, it's only scratching the surface. Just like how a Doctor has identified a disease, the Doctor now has to prescribe a treatment. What essentially is required to do this is to start looking for how the mind is acting and reacting and letting go of all and any tension that arises and when it arises. Be kind to yourself and let go of the things that cause you distress. Take every chance to let go of tension and relax.  , The point of this is simply to learn which things cause the mind stress and which causes the mind to relax. When you can note all mental activity, this is where you develop insight. Look for all the times you want something or want something to go away. Ask yourself ""is wanting something making a problem?"". See the Four Noble truths for more on this as these can be applied directly to the heart of the problem.  , Ultimately it allows you to expand the scope of what you can identify as well as decide for yourself what is pleasant and unpleasant to experience so you can deal with them accordingly. By seeing how stress is caused, you no longer feel that you have to get involved, or that the chattering in the mind is really any benefit. It then becomes easy to just let it go. When you can both note all the things in the mind both in and out of meditation, as well as know what it does, practice wordless awareness. You can ask yourself ""Can I do this without mental noting?"" and just be aware without any other activities. Eventually the mind both recognises the things that cause stress and just lets go of them and relaxes because it has learnt that letting go is the way to release the stress. You can also see the benefit of mindfulness so you are happier to do it. Because while there isn't a way to bullet proof the mind from doing stressful things, mindfulness is only a way to primarily learn, then recognise and finally let go of what's there and avoid getting involved with future traps. Then, as the mind becomes thoroughly disenchanted with getting involved in stressful thoughts and feelings, you are free of them.

"['look at how complex the divisor is', 'look at how complex the dividend is', 'look to see if all the terms in the dividend contain a common factor with the divisor', 'look for special patterns in the dividend that tell you it can be factored', 'use trial and error to factor the dividend', 'set up the division', 'divide the first term of the divisor into the first term of the dividend', 'multiply the x in the quotient position by the divisor', 'subtract from the dividend', 'repeat the previous three steps on the interim quotient']",How to Divide Polynomials," How complicated the divisor (the polynomial you’re dividing by) is compared to the dividend (the polynomial you’re dividing into) determines which approach is best.  If the divisor is a monomial (single-term polynomial), either a variable with a coefficient, or a constant (a number without a variable following it), you can probably factor the dividend and cancel out one of the resulting factors and the divisor. See “Factoring the Dividend” for instructions and examples.  If the divisor is a binomial (two-term polynomial), you may be able to factor the dividend and cancel out one of the resulting factors and the divisor.  If the divisor is a trinomial (three-term polynomial), you may be able to factor both the dividend and the divisor, cancel out the common factor, and then either factor out the dividend further or use long division.  If the divisor is a polynomial with more than three factors, you will probably have to use long division. See “Using Long Polynomial Division” for instructions and examples. ; , If looking at the divisor polynomial of the equation doesn’t tell you whether you should try to factor the dividend, look at the dividend itself.  If the dividend has three terms or fewer, you can probably factor it and cancel out the divisor.   If the dividend has more than three terms, you will probably have to divide the divisor into it by using long division.   , If this is the case, you can factor it out and probably cancel out the divisor.  If you’re dividing the binomial 3x – 9 by 3, you can factor 3 out of both terms of the binomial, making it 3(x – 3). You can then cancel out the divisor of 3, leaving a quotient of x – 3.  If you’re dividing the binomial 24x3 - 18x2 by 6x, you can factor 6x out of both terms of the binomial, making it 6x(4x2 - 3). You can the cancel out the divisor of 6x, leaving a quotient of 4x2 - 3.   , Certain polynomials display terms that tell you they can be factored. If one of those factors matches the divisor, you can cancel it out, leaving the remaining factor as the quotient. Here are some patterns to look for:  Difference of perfect squares. This is a binomial of the form ‘’a 2x2 - b 2’’, where the values of ‘’a 2’’ and ‘’b 2’’ are perfect squares. This binomial factors into two binomials (ax + b)(ax – b), where a and b are the square roots of the coefficient and constant of the earlier binomial.  Perfect square trinomial. This trinomial is in the form a2x2 + 2abx + b 2. It factors to (ax + b)(ax + b), which may also be written (ax + b)2. If the sign in front of the second term is a minus sign, the binomial factors will be in the form (ax – b)(ax – b).  Sum or difference of cubes. This is a binomial of the form a3x3 + b3 or a3x3 - b3, where the values of ‘’a 3’’ and ‘’b 3’’ are perfect cubes. This binomial factors into a binomial and a trinomial. A sum of cubes factors down to (ax + b)(a2x2 - abx + b2). A difference of cubes factors down to (ax - b)(a2x2 + abx + b2).   , If you don’t see a discernible pattern in the dividend to tell you how to factor it, you can try several possible factoring combinations. You can do this by looking first at the constant and finding several factors for it, then at the coefficient of the middle term.  For example, if the dividend is x2 - 3x – 10, you would look at the factors of 10 and use the 3 to help determine which factor pair is correct.  The number 10 can be broken into factors of 1 and 10 or 2 and 5. Because the sign in front of 10 is negative, one of the factor binomials has to have a negative number in front of its constant.   The number 3 is the difference between 2 and 5, so these must be the constants of the factor binomials. Because the sign in front of the 3 is negative, the binomial with the 5 must be the one with the negative number. The binomial factors are thus (x – 5)(x + 2). If the divisor is one of these two factors, that factor can be canceled out, and the remaining factor is the quotient.   , You write out the long division of polynomials the same as you do for dividing numbers. The dividend goes under the long division bar, while the divisor goes to the left.  If you’re dividing x2 + 11 x + 10 by x +1, x2 + 11 x + 10 goes under the bar, while x + 1 goes to the left.   , The result of this division goes on top of the division bar.  For our example, dividing x2, the first term of the dividend, by x, the first term of the divisor yields x. You would write an x on the top of the division bar, over the x2.   , Write the result of the multiplication under the leftmost terms of the dividend.  Continuing with our example, multiplying x + 1 by x produces x2 + x. You would write this under the first two terms of the dividend.   , To do so, first reverse the signs of the product of the multiplication. After subtracting, bring down the remaining terms of the dividend.  Reversing the signs of x2 + x gives - x2 - x. Subtracting this from the first two terms of the dividend leaves 10x. After bringing down the remaining term of the dividend, you have 10x + 10 as the interim quotient to continue the division process with.   , You’ll again divide the first term of the divisor into that of the interim quotient, write that result on top of the division bar after the first term of the quotient, multiply the result by the divisor, and then calculate what to subtract from the interim quotient.  Because x goes into 10x 10 times, you would write “+ 10” after the x in the quotient position on the division bar.  Multiplying x +1 by 10 gives 10x + 10. You write this under the interim quotient and reverse the signs for the subtraction, making -10x – 10.  When you perform the subtraction, you have a remainder of 0. Thus, dividing x2 + 11 x + 10 by x +1 produces a quotient of x + 10. (You could have gotten the same result by factoring, but this example was chosen to keep the division fairly simple.)

It is important to note that these are more guidelines than rules; a Pastor may be Byzantine but wear a Roman cassock, for example.    The Pope is easy to distinguish by the fact that his everyday cassock (robe worn by clergy when not doing anything liturgically) is white. He is usually the only one who has a white cassock (there is a tiny chance that an Eastern clergy member might wear a white cassock, since colors are not regulated closely in all Eastern Churches, and some Latin Priests are permitted to wear white cassocks in tropical countries).  A Cardinal has a red cassock (although it should be noted that at least one regular Eastern Bishop has one).  A Metropolitan or Eastern Bishop may wear a loose cassock, a riasa (a cloak-type garment worn over the cassock, with long, flowing sleeves), a tall black hat, possibly with a veil; in some Slavic traditions, a Metropolitan's hat will be white), and a Panagia, which is a medal with an icon of the Theotokos on it.  A Latin Bishop may be recognized by the red lining, piping and buttons on his black cassock, the red sash around his waist, and that red skullcap (zucchetto). He also wears a pectoral Cross.  A Monsignor is known by the red ng, piping and buttons on his black cassock. But he does not wear a pectoral Cross or a red skullcap. This title of honour is generally not given any more in the East.  An Archpriest is maybe the Eastern Catholic equivalent of the rank of Monsignor. If he chooses to wear a hat, it may be purple or red. In a liturgical setting, he can also wear the shields, like a Bishop. Other than that, he dresses like an Eastern Rite Priest.  An Eastern rite Priest dresses the same as a Bishop, with some exceptions. Instead of a Panagia, he wears a pectoral Cross. Instead of a klobuk, he may wear a black kamilavka. In some Churches, the kamilavka is a reward, while in others it is an option for any Priest.  A Latin Priest wears a tighter fitting cassock. He also wears the white collar.  An Eastern Deacon dresses the same as an Eastern Rite Priest, minus the pectoral Cross.; , He should be directly addressed as “Deacon (Last Name)” – or, on paper, as “The Reverend Mr. (First and Last Name).”  ,,,, During a formal introduction, a mother superior should be introduced as “The Reverend Mother (First and Last Name) of (name of community).” She should be directly addressed as “Reverend Mother (First and Last Name),” “Reverend Mother,” or, on paper, as “The Reverend Mother (First and Last Name), (initials of community).”  ,, (First Name and Last Name).” Note that, as with a Priest, you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it.  , During a formal introduction, a Monsignor should be introduced as “The Reverend Monsignor (First and Last Name).” He should be directly addressed as “Monsignor (Last Name)” or simply “Monsignor,” – or, on paper, as “The Reverend Monsignor (First Name and Last Name).” Note that, as with a Priest, you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it.  , During a formal introduction, a Bishop should be introduced as “His Most Reverend Excellency, (First and Last Name), Bishop of (Location).” He should be directly addressed as “Your Excellency” – or, on paper, as “His Excellency, The Most Reverend (First Name and Last Name), Bishop of (Location)”. Note that you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it. Remove your hat in his presence, and you may kiss the sacred ring during both the greeting and the closing. If he is your own Bishop, you may kneel when kissing the ring (though bowing at the waist is also acceptable); however, do not do either if the Pope is present.  , During a formal introduction, an Archbishop should be introduced in the same way listed above for a Bishop. However in some parts of Canada, especially in the West, it is common practice to address an Archbishop as “His Grace"". In this case, during a formal introduction, an Archbishop could be introduced as “His Grace, (First and Last Name), Archbishop of (Location).” He could be directly addressed as “Your Grace” or “Archbishop (Last Name),” – or, on paper, as “His Grace, The Most Reverend (First Name and Last Name), Archbishop of (Location)”. Note that, as with a Bishop, you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it. Remove your hat in his presence, and you may kiss the sacred ring during both the greeting and the closing. If he is your own Archbishop, you may kneel when kissing the ring (though bowing at the waist is also acceptable); however, do not do either if the Pope is present.  , During a formal introduction, a Patriarch should be introduced as “His Beatitude, (First and Last Name) Patriarch of (Location).” He should be directly addressed as “Your Beatitude” (except in Lisbon, where he is addressed as “Your Eminence”) or, on paper, as “His Beatitude, the Most Reverend (First and Last Name), Patriarch of (Location).” Note that, as with an Archbishop, you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it. Remove your hat in his presence, and you may kiss the sacred ring during both the greeting and the closing. If he is your own Patriarch, you may kneel when kissing the ring (though bowing at the waist is also acceptable); however, do not do either if the Pope is present.  , During a formal introduction, a Cardinal should be introduced as “His Eminence, (First Name) Cardinal (Last Name), Archbishop of (Location).” He should be directly addressed as “Your Eminence” or “Cardinal (Last Name)” – or, on paper, as “His Eminence, (First Name) Cardinal (Last Name), Archbishop of (Location).” Note that, as with a Patriarch, you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it. Remove your hat in his presence, and you may kiss the sacred ring during both the greeting and the closing. If he is your own Bishop, you may kneel when kissing the ring (though bowing at the waist is also acceptable); however, do not do either if the Pope is present.  , During a formal introduction, the Pope should be introduced as “His Holiness, Pope (Name).” He should be directly addressed as “Your Holiness” or “Holy Father” – or, on paper, as “His Holiness, Pope (Name)” or “The Sovereign Pontiff, His Holiness (Name).” Note that men should wear a dark suit and tie and remove their hats in his presence, while women should wear black dresses that cover their arms, as well as a head covering such as a veil (dressing in white clothes and veil, known as the privilège du blanc). Stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it. When introduced, kneel on your left knee and kiss his ring; repeat before he leaves.   Le privilège du blanc (""the privilege of the white"") is a French term used for a tradition whereby certain designated Catholic queens and princesses are permitted to wear a white dress and white mantilla during an audience with the Pope. The Italian term is il privilegio del bianco. The Prefecture of the Pontifical Household sometimes issues special instructions when the privilege may be used, such as during papal audiences or masses at the beginning of a pope's reign. It is reserved for the Catholic queens of Belgium and Spain, the Princess Consort of Monaco, the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, and princesses of the former Italian royal House of Savoy.

Also look for programs that can teach you to inspect a wide variety of building types including condominiums, townhouses, apartments, skyscrapers, residential homes, prefabricated buildings, and new construction projects.; , Training in engineering and/or architecture is a great asset in this field. Community colleges tend to offer a wider variety of courses in this area while vocational schools may have more specifically tailored courses.If you go with the community college choice, consider taking additional courses in algebra, geometry, writing, and anything that might contribute to reading of blueprints and construction skill-building. If you select a vocational school, in addition to the program coverage from the earlier step and the certification from the following step, try to go with a good record of career placement.  , Whatever building inspector training program you enter needs to be working towards the proper certification. Ask your local government if this school's certification matches with the official requirements.The inspection program should include field training, provisions for state licensing in the states that have them, and preparation for the national and state exams you need to pass.  , You will be learning from experienced inspectors during your vocational program and/or on the job training. This is an important foundation for employment later as well.   Some mentoring programs are highly structured, and will thoroughly lay out your schedule as you shadow your more experienced partner. If your mentor is not as ""hands on"" as you would like, ask for more attention or another partner. In either the job or vocational setting, you need to be shadowing inspections, learning codes, techniques, terminology, and developing communication skills with other inspectors, customers, as well as subjects.  , This is one of the most important steps to becoming a building inspector. Some education in relate fields such as architecture can be substituted here, but there is no substitute for performing inspections yourself under the supervision of a knowledgeable partner.You might ask your prospective program how they handle this aspect, if they have a mentoring program as referenced in the earlier step, and how many hours of this they provide towards certification. Compare how much field experience you can get on the job and in programs to what you need for the license you apply to.  , There are two major national test models. Any version of the test will cover similar categories of building inspection knowledge.The national exam is usually based off of the test created by one of two groups: The American Society of Home Inspectors or the National Association of Home Inspectors. These exams will cover the subjects including the building site, exteriors, roofing, garages, attics, exterior structures, interior structures, foundations, environmental hazards, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, electrical systems, air and water quality, plumbing, codes of conduct and ethics.  , This is a good idea for any national test, and can help focus your attention on the questions and classroom knowledge you will need to pass the exam. This may be something your chosen school also offers.The courses can be expensive, several hundreds of dollars, so be sure this will benefit you. If you can ask about the test question types, and what else to expect from those that have taken it, do so.  , If a sample test is available, add this to your training. Verify that the test you're sampling has relevant questions by asking your training program.   A run through the test, even an old one under test conditions can be a help to your performance on the test later on. This test is usually computerized at this time, but the practice questions and timing can be simulated. Do this a few times to improve your score and timing.  , Make sure you have selected a facility relatively easy to reach at the day and time the test is given. Get a detailed set of instructions for any facility procedures.When applying for the test, you will need to provide your full name, home address, social security number, telephone number, date of birth, exam date, and test center location. Upon arrival at the test you will need your application confirmation number, examination fee (unless already paid), two forms of identification (ask the test center what is accepted if unsure--usually one must be a photo-identification like a driver's license), the score report of the previous tests if this is a retake, and name of the exam(s) you are taking this time.  , You should find out of there are additional regulations, codes, and/or licenses you need to familiarize yourself with and/or acquire. You can find out how far your certification is valid for geographically.Different states can require different levels of education, specific additional exams, additional field experience, and liability insurance.  , This is a career that involves a great deal of movement through structures, and explaining technical findings to others. Communication skills are also crucial.Inspectors should expect to move in and out of buildings frequently, and in and around all of the spaces that make up the structures they inspect. This job requires the ability to explain problems found during inspections to those that hired the inspector and those that were inspected. This includes translating what may be technical architectural terms into something non-specialists can understand. Having some knowledge and being able to perform construction can help inspectors with certification. Being able to understand, use, and investigate complex mechanical systems is also something that is useful. In the field, using these systems can happen Expect to have to look into the details of your assignments. Inspectors frequently have to multi-task and handle close examination of several construction activities simultaneously without overlooking any of their individual components.  , There are a number of public and private careers for building inspectors.This is one of a couple of common paths inspectors take into employment--working for others.When you reach this stage of your career development, review your program's career links to see if they have any deals with existing companies or government agencies that may get you employment. Some categories of jobs for building inspectors include local government departments, construction contractors, architecture firms, real estate businesses, and home owners. Getting a job is best done through your original training program if they offer placement assistance. Other ways to get jobs include listings at government employment commissions, hiring agencies. Make sure that the jobs you look for are in areas your certification will be valid.  , This is a considerable undertaking, but one to think about if you don't pursue inspection work with others. You would need to establish commercial credentials, and build up clients or contract work.There are many paths to . Make sure you check your state and city ordinances if you go this route. In addition to your certification for inspection, there will be other business licenses you may need. Consult Federal assistance programs for start up businesses as well. These can help you with networking, financing, and ideas for gathering clients. Think about joining your local, state, and federal chambers of commerce to improve your business's visibility and ability to get inspection contracts.  , As of 2012, the pay range for inspectors varied from approximately $32,000 to $84,000. Take into consideration if this pay range is suitable for your needs and lifestyle.This pay reflects mostly full-time work during the business day--though workloads can increase during periods of disaster, site accidents, or heavy construction months. Approximately 11 percent of inspectors were self-employed.  , Overall growth for building inspectors is growing, but entry is being somewhat constrained to those with field experience over education-only applicants. Take this into consideration when applying to multiple jobs.Multiple-field experience inspectors are the highest in demand, especially by the government. These are inspectors with specialties in engineering, architecture, electrical systems, etc... Larger locales favor specialized inspectors while smaller areas favor inspectors that are more broadly skilled.

If your puppy is hypoglycemic, you'll first notice it moving more slowly and becoming restless. As the hypoglycemia worsens and your puppy’s brain is starved for glucose, your puppy will tremble, have a blank stare, and fall on its side.Other signs of hypoglycemia include:Wobbly walking Shivering Head tilt; , As soon as you notice your young puppy looking restless, try feeding it some food.Eating a little bit of food may be enough to raise your puppy’s blood glucose back to normal levels.If your puppy does not want to eat, then you will need to feed it some sugar.   If your young puppy is still nursing, you may need to bottle feed it.  , A small dose of sugar will help to quickly raise your puppy’s blood glucose levels. Rather than giving your puppy sugar crystals, give it a liquid sugar source:Nutri-Cal® (available at your local pet store) Maple syrup Karo syrup Molasses  , Give your puppy the sugar source by either rubbing a small amount on the gums with your finger or placing a few drops under your puppy’s tongue.Placing the sugar source on the gums or under the tongue will help it be absorbed more quickly by the body.One to two tablespoons of a sugar source is usually enough to revive a small dog with hypoglycemia.If your young puppy is really tiny, ask your vet about how much you should give. You can also place a few drops of the sugar source on your puppy’s tongue.If you’re going to give drops of the sugar source, use a medicine dropper. To prevent your puppy from choking, do not put the sugar source directly down its throat., In many instances of puppy hypoglycemia, just a small amount of sugar will be enough to revive the puppy.If the hypoglycemia is not severe, your puppy should perk back up in one to two minutes.If your puppy does not respond, contact your vet immediately.   Be aware that the sugar source is just a quick fix. Your puppy’s blood glucose levels may drop again, causing another episode of hypoglycemia.If your puppy becomes hypoglycemic again, give it more of the sugar source and contact your vet.  , If you needed to give your puppy a sugar source to handle its hypoglycemia, feed it a small amount of high-quality canned puppy food once it perks up.The food will give your puppy more glucose and help it recover.   If your puppy refuses the canned food, try feeding it some tasty treats., Even if your puppy looks fine after getting a little bit of sugar, your vet should still examine your puppy to determine if a health problem has caused the hypoglycemia. If your puppy did not respond at all to the sugar, then a vet visit is essential to get your puppy the intensive care it will need to recover.   Your puppy will also need to see your vet if it responded to the sugar, but became hypoglycemic again., Your vet will need to confirm that your young puppy has hypoglycemia. They will first perform a physical exam of your puppy. Then, they will take a small blood sample to measure your puppy’s blood glucose levels.Intestinal parasites can rob your young puppy’s body of important nutrients like glucose. Your vet may also perform a fecal exam to look for intestinal parasites., If your puppy has severe hypoglycemia, it will need immediate and intensive treatment by your vet. To administer this treatment, your vet will need to hospitalize your puppy for at least one day. Examples of intensive treatment for young puppies with hypoglycemia are:Intravenous dextrose (a type of sugar) Deworming (kills intestinal parasites) Heat therapy Fluids  , A young puppy’s body cannot regulate its blood glucose levels very well. Feeding your young puppy multiple times a day, at the same times each day, can help prevent hypoglycemia.Puppies should eat three to four times a day.Leave the food out for 10 to 20 minutes. This will help prevent your puppy from becoming a picky eater—it will learn that it should eat right away, rather than pick at the food for a long time., A healthy puppy diet, when fed multiple times a day, will help keep your young puppy’s blood glucose levels from dropping too low. Also, high-quality puppy food will give your puppy the nutrients it needs to grow into a healthy adult dog.Many types of puppy diets are available. If you are unsure which one is right for your puppy, talk with your breeder or vet for guidance. Puppies have specific nutritional needs. Do not feed your puppy an adult dog diet. Canned foods tend to be tastier than dry foods.Your puppy may prefer canned food. Realize that the feeding guidelines on the food label may not work for your young puppy. Talk with your vet to determine how much you should feed your puppy at each meal.  , A puppy should gain a little bit of weight every day. Daily weight gain means it’s eating enough food and getting enough nutrients, including glucose. Try weighing your puppy using a gram scale, which you can purchase a kitchen supply store. Record the weight on a piece of paper.If your young puppy is too big or wiggly for a gram scale, try this: Weigh yourself on a regular scale, then hold your puppy in your arms. To get your puppy’s weight, subtract your weight from the weight of you and your puppy. If your puppy is not gaining weight, or is losing weight, it could be sick. Take your puppy to your vet.  , A cold puppy will use up extra glucose to stay warm, causing a condition called juvenile hypoglycemia. To prevent this type of hypoglycemia, wrap your young puppy in extra blankets to keep it warm. Also, keep your home at a warm temperature., Stress can cause a young puppy to become hypoglycemic. Examples of stressful events are vaccinations (or vet visits in general), over-handling, illness, and changes in a puppy’s environment.Minimizing your puppy’s stress can help prevent hypoglycemia.   Give your puppy treats when it behaves well at the vet’s office. That way, it may not get so stressed when it’s there. Do not try to handle your puppy all the time. Give it some alone time so it can rest. Keep your puppy’s routine the same from day to day.

You'll be engaged in your Potter-viewing mission for about 20 hours, likely longer with breaks, so you'll want to be sure that everyone has a comfortable seat and a clear view of the screen., You could simply choose a day on the weekend when your friends are free to host your party, or you might want to pick a date that references the Harry Potter universe. For example, you might have your party on September third at 4:00 PM, since Harry boards the Hogwarts express on platform 9 (September is the ninth month) and ¾. (which represents the third day at four o'clock)., Twenty hours is a long time to watch anything, even something that you love. You might want to split your marathon into two days and do a half marathon each day, or you might only want to marathon your favorite movies. In any case, write down your general viewing schedule, so you can tell your friends the start and end time of your marathon.   You can add some fun and imagination to your marathon by also making it a theme party. For true, diehard fans who plan on watching the entire series from beginning to end, you should plan a sleepover party. Otherwise, you may have trouble fitting 20 hours of viewing into a single day.  , Sitting for long periods of time without moving can be bad for your heath. Think of Harry Potter themed activities you might do to stretch out your body between viewings. This might include:   Pretend dueling Muggle quidditch A Potterverse based board game Potter themed charades or pictionary Potter themed online quizzes  , Due to the combined length of the movies, you'll have to start watching early in the day and end late at night. You might even need to continue watching until the morning of the following day. Include your viewing schedule for your guests on your Potter themed invitation, and don't forget to include the address for the party, the time it starts and ends, and whether or not there will be refreshments.   If you're trying to plan your party on a budget, you might consider making your party a potluck, where everyone brings a dish to pass. This should be clearly indicated on your invitations.Write your invitations on yellowed, parchment style paper so your invites imitate mail in the Potterverse. Purchase this paper at your local craft store or at an art supply store. Use pictures that reference Harry Potter in your invitations. For example, since owls deliver mail in the wizarding world, you might include the picture of an owl on your invitation.  , You don't want hunger pangs to interrupt your epic marathon! Think about some popular treats served in the wizarding world, and then do some research online to find recipes for these. You might serve butterbeer or pumpkin juice as drinks, and for food you might prepare golden snitch cupcakes or Bertie Botts strange flavored jellybeans. You might make:Homemade butterbeer Treacle tart Cauldron cakes Pumpkin juice  , If you don't have any of the Harry Potter movies, or if you are missing some of them, you'll have to purchase or rent the missing DVDs. Check for scratches ahead of time and give each movie a test run before the day of your party. It would be disappointing if you made it most of the way through your marathon and then had to stop due to a damaged disk or corrupted digital file.   If you're missing one of the Harry Potter movies in your collection, you might ask one of your friends to bring the movie to the party. That way you can focus on getting ready!  , When your marathon day finally arrives, put the first movie on your TV and allow it to play for a few minutes to check the volume. After you've adjusted the volume to a good level, pause the movie at the beginning so all you have to do is push ""play."", Disposable cups, paper plates, and a few rolls of paper towel can make clean up easier when your marathon's through.You can even buy cups and plates decorated with Harry Potter designs. These should be available at your local grocery or dollar store, though if you have difficulty finding Potterverse themed products, an online retailer might be your best bet.  , Depending on the recipes you've found, or depending on your favorite Potterverse treats, you may need to buy additional supplies from your local grocery store. Once your treats are made, arrange your snacks in a way that mimics the movie, like arranging food on a long table like.   Organize your treats on a rolling cart and pretend during food breaks that you're riding the Hogwarts Express! Have backup treats ready so that when you've finished one you don't have to interrupt viewing.  , You don't need to go over the top, but small details will certainly add to the atmosphere. If you plan on playing muggle quidditch you'll need brooms for players, and these could be stacked off to the side as decorations in the meantime. Posters from the movies can be taped to walls, butterbeer served in an intricate looking carafe or coffee press, and the books can be placed around the viewing area to give your home some Potter flair., These can be something that you send your guests on their way with once the party is done, or maybe you'll want to give these to your friends when they arrive as a way of saying thanks for coming. To make your goody-bags more authentic, you might include:   Chocolate coins wrapped in gold foil Mini creatures, like spiders, frogs, and dragons A ""potion"" that's really a juice box  , You'll want your space to be as comfortable and as easy to move around in as possible. Move furniture that is blocks walkways or takes up unnecessary space, and bring extra seating from other rooms if you are able.If you are worried you won't have enough seating, you might make a cozy nest with blankets and pillows in front of your TV.  , Even if you don't have a CD of the soundtrack from one of the Harry Potter movies, you can still stream tracks from YouTube, Pandora, or other online media providers. This will get your guests into the mood to marathon watch Harry Potter from start to finish., This may be as simple as having your guests choose a strip of paper with one of the four Hogwarts houses written on it from a ""Sorting Hat."" Or you might do something more elaborate, like have each guest that's arrived duel the next guest to arrive.If dueling, you might want to write up a cheat sheet for duelists that has offensive and defensive spells listed.  , After you've sorted your guests according to house, you can award points to each house for good things done and trivia known. Use a spare piece of parchment style paper leftover from your invitations, if you have any, and keep track of house points to make things fun. You might award points for:   Quoting lines with the movie Knowing obscure movie facts Pointing out errors and mistakes  , Unplanned breaks might happen over the course of your marathon, but each of those will add time to your already 20 hour long journey through the Potterverse. Be sure food is conveniently placed so that your guests can eat as they get hungry.   Stopping to prepare food can put you behind in your viewing schedule. Have pre-made food ready to go in your refrigerator, or plan in advance to order in once the snacks are gone.  , Stand up and really stretch yourself out every hour or so to prevent yourself from becoming uncomfortable. Sitting for extended periods of time is bad for your health, but taking five to moving around and stretch out every 30 minutes to an hour can relieve many of these problems., As you and your guests graze on the goodies you've set out, you'll have to clear off empty dishes and bring out more food as necessary.

"[""decide who's eligible to take part in the tournament"", ""determine which species of fish you're fishing for"", 'decide where you want to hold the tournament', 'choose a date or dates for the tournament', 'familiarize yourself with the fishing and boating regulations of the jurisdiction where you plan to hold the tournament', 'establish the tournament rules', 'set the entry fee', 'promote the event']",How to Host a Fishing Tournament," This often depends on the organization putting on the event.   For a fishing tournament put on by a fishing club or professional fishing organization, entries are generally limited to members in good standing of the organization. Some organizations may allow prospective members to join the organization and enter their first tournament at the same time. For a youth fishing tournament, entries are limited to children of a certain age, although younger children may be partnered with or assisted by an adult or older sibling.; , Fishing tournaments can be held to fish for a single species of fish, a related group of species, or any legal game fish that can be caught at the site of the tournament.   Fishing tournaments organized by professional fishing associations typically restrict themselves to a single species or fish family. For instance, competitors in tournaments run by B.A.S.S. fish for largemouth and (sometimes) smallmouth bass. Competitors in tournaments run by the Walleye Federation (TWF) fish for walleye. Fishing tournaments run by amateur fishing associations not associated with a particular fish species have a freer selection of species to fish for. In some cases, the best species to fish for can be determined by which species are most in need of being fished to maintain a proper predator/prey balance in the waters where the tournament will be held. In other cases, the maturity of the angler should play the dominant role; a tournament for pre-teen or special needs children should probably be for any legal fish in the waters being fished.  , Fishing tournaments can be held at lakes, reservoirs, streams, or in the ocean. Where you hold the tournament depends on several factors:   Availability of the fish species you're fishing for. Generally, the lakes where B.A.S.S. and TWF hold their tournaments are noted among anglers for their populations of bass and walleye. Accessibility to the anglers who'll be competing. While many remote lakes in Canada are noted for their populations of walleye, a reservoir such as Lake Oahe in South Dakota is more accessible to the majority of walleye anglers and thus a better tournament site. Venue size. Generally, lakes and artificial reservoirs that host fishing tournaments are medium-to larger-sized lakes to accommodate the number of anglers who may take part. Association with the organizing group. In most cases, organizations with a state or other jurisdiction in their group's name will want to hold their fishing tournaments within that jurisdiction's borders, assuming the above criteria are met. The Nebraska Walleye Association holds its tournaments at sites within Nebraska that are known for walleye; such as Merritt Reservoir, Lewis and Clark Lake, and Lake McConaughy; however, the Nebraska B.A.S.S. Federation holds most of its tournaments outside Nebraska, as Nebraska has few bass hotspots large enough to host a tournament.  , Most fishing tournaments are held on weekends and may include both Saturday and Sunday. The best weekends are those where the body of water under consideration is not under peak use from non-tournament anglers and other outdoor enthusiasts.   Consider whether the species you plan to fish for in the tournament is spawning during that period. Some jurisdictions prohibit fishing for spawning fish in certain waters, and some organizations consider it unethical to fish for spawning fish.  , Regardless of what other rules you plan to have for your tournament, you must conform to the bag and possession limits and any other regulations for the state or other jurisdiction where the fishing tournament is held, as well as to the legal methods for catching fish. You can find this information on the jurisdiction's fish and wildlife department's website. (The actual name of the department may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; it may be known as the Department of Natural Resources or the Game and Parks Commission, for example.)   Bag limits refer to the number of fish that may be caught per day. In many cases, tournaments restrict the number of fish caught per day on a multi-day tournament to fewer fish than the jurisdiction's limit. Possession limits refer to how many fish an angler may have in his or her possession at any given time, whether on a stringer, in a cooler on site, or in a freezer at home. For tournaments where live fish are returned to the water after being weighed, possession limits are not a concern, but if the anglers competing are allowed to keep any or all of their catch, it may be. Some species have minimum or maximum lengths or weights imposed by the state in order to ensure a suitable population for all anglers. In some cases, more stringent length and weight limits are imposed on a given lake or stream or during spawning season to ensure a sustainable fishery. Boating regulations typically include such requirements as life jackets for each occupant of the boat, running lights for night use, and a kill switch for outboard motors of a certain horsepower or greater. Some jurisdictions in densely populated areas where the lake a tournament is to be held is used as a source of drinking water may require boats on that lake to be steam-cleaned and bear a sticker attesting to this.  , Rules for a fishing tournament may encompass any or all of the following:   Scoring. Tournaments generally determine a winner by total weight of fish caught during the tournament. In the event of ties, they may use the weight of the biggest fish caught as a tie-breaker. What tackle may be used. Tackle is usually restricted to rods and reels and may be restricted by the type of rod and reel (as in fly-fishing tournaments) or even rod length. Participants may also be restricted as to how many rods they can have in use at a given time. What fishing methods may be used. Depending on the tournament, this may mean disallowing trolling, snagging fish, or the use of live bait. Whether participants fish alone or with a partner. Fishing tournaments where the participants fish from shore tend to allow their participants to fish alone, while tournaments where the participants fish from boats often pair anglers so that each can witness the other's actions. Areas off-limits to fishing. Some tournaments have rules as to how close competitors may be to each other when fishing as well as a minimum distance from the host marina. Participation/use of fishing guides. Some tournaments may allow guides to compete in tournaments on lakes and streams where they normally guide, provided they are not hired by any of the other participants during the tournament and for a period of time before it. Allowing practice fishing prior to the tournament so participants may scout the lake for hot spots. Most tournaments allow this, although they may disallow it for a brief period before the event. (In its early years, the Bassmasters Classic kept the tournament site secret until just prior to the tournament, thus effectively prohibiting practice fishing.) Handling/preservation of the fish. Many freshwater fishing tournaments require competitors to keep their fish alive until weighing, often with an in-boat live well or similar method, and many include either rewards or penalties related to the fish's condition at weigh-in. Live fish are usually returned to the water after weighing; dead fish may be donated to a charity such as a homeless shelter for feeding its residents. Conduct of participants. This includes a stated expectation of good sportsmanship and may also include rules against seeding a spot with baitfish prior to the tournament, barring access to hot spots, and prohibition of alcohol or other drugs. Legal issues and disputes. Tournaments may require competitors who use their own boats to have and carry proof of liability insurance for themselves and their passengers. They may also stipulate a time limit for submitting and a method for resolving disputes that arise.  , The entry fee should be based on the number of participants you expect to attract and allow you to recoup your administrative and promotional costs. You'll likely pay a fee to the hosting marina and possibly to a governmental agency; you may also want to have a post-tournament dinner.   You can defer some of the costs by seeking sponsors for the tournament, such as businesses local to the tournament site, major sporting goods stores, and fishing tackle manufacturers.  , To make your fishing tournament a success, you'll need to promote it effectively. Your marketing plan can include any or all of the following:   Cooperative advertising with the host marina, tournament sponsors, and charities benefiting from the event. Contacting outdoor writers for local newspapers and fishing magazines and submitting press releases for those publications. Social media such as Facebook and Twitter before the event and Pinterest to post photos after the event to build interest in subsequent events. Posters and flyers in sporting goods stores and local businesses and at related events.

This means you’ll see things like Vincent Van Gogh’s Sunflowers painting. Thus, if you’re familiar with some pieces of art, you’ll be able to tell which pieces are fake.  For example, a fake Venus de Milo has hair that goes down to her shoulders as opposed to the genuine hair cropped just above her ears.; , Redd displays his art in the four different corners of his tent. This means, at first glance, it can be very difficult to scrutinize the paintings and statues. Keep in mind, though, that you can change the camera’s angle inside the tent by pressing the directional buttons on the D-pad.  For example, pressing the right directional button will cause the camera to move to the left, enabling you to better see the painting in the upper-right corner of the tent. Considering that seeing the piece of art is crucial to determining whether or not it’s a fake, you should do your best to use the directional buttons on the D-pad to get a good view.  , Do be aware that Redd does not refer to any of his art pieces by their actual names. Instead, they will have names like “Perfect painting.”, This painting by Peter Bruegel depicts a number of hunters who have reached a snowy village., This painting by Paul Cézanne depicts a bunch of apples and oranges on top of pedestals and white tablecloth with a purple background., This painting by Eugène Delacroix depicts a war victory with someone standing in the middle with the French flag., This painting by Paul Gaugin depicts a number of dark-colored women with a dog in the front., This painting by Vincent Van Gogh depicts a vase filled with sunflowers., This painting by Francisco Goya depicts a woman lying in repose with black hair and yellow sleeves., This painting by Édouard Manet depicts a woman in the center at a bar with a party going on in the background., This painting by Édouard Manet depicts a young boy standing and playing the flute., This painting by Jean-Francois Millet depicts three people working on a farm., This painting by Jean-Francois Millet depicts one man sowing seeds on a farm., This painting by Georges-Pierre Seurat depicts a number of people out enjoying an afternoon in the park., This painting by Giuseppe Arcimboldo depicts a person with a face made out of produce.

Covalent compounds have the first element written out completely while the second element is named with the suffix “ide”. For example diphosphorus trisulfide has a chemical formula of P2S3.Below are the prefixes for 1-10:   1: Mono- 2: Di- 3: Tri- 4: Tetra- 5: Penta- 6: Hexa- 7: Hepta- 8: Octa- 9: Nona- 10: Deca-; , When a compound has been written out, you must identify the elements and know their chemical symbols. The first element written is “first name” of the compound. Use the periodic table to find the chemical symbol for the element.For example: Dinitrogen hexafluoride. The first element is nitrogen and the chemical symbol for nitrogen is N.  , To identify the number of atoms present for each element, you simply need to look at the prefix of the element. Memorizing the Greek prefixes will help you to be able to write chemical formulas quickly without looking anything up.For example: Dinitrogen has a the prefix “di-“ which means 2; therefore, there are two atoms of nitrogen present. Write dinitrogen as N2.  , The second element is the “last name” of the compound and will follow the first element. For covalent compounds, the element name will have a suffix of “-ide” instead of the normal ending of the element.For example: Dinitrogen hexafluoride. The second element is fluorine. Simply replace the “ide” ending with the actual element name. The chemical symbol for fluorine is F.  , As you did with the first element, identify the number of atoms present in the second element by reading the prefix. Using this prefix, write the number of atoms as a subscript to the right of the chemical symbol.For example: Hexafluoride has a prefix of “hexa-“ which means 6; therefore, there are 6 atoms of fluorine present. Write hexafluoride as F6. The final chemical formula for dinitrogen hexafluoride is N2F6.  , When first learning chemistry, there is a lot of memorization involved. It is kind of like learning a new language. The more examples you practice with, the easier it will be to decipher chemical formulas in the future and learn the language of chemistry.   Sulfur dioxide: SO2  Carbon tetrabromide: CBr4  Diphosphorous pentoxide: P2O5   , All chemicals have what you can call a first and last name. The first name is the cation (positive ion) while the last name is the anion (negative ion). Cations are written as the element name while anions are the element name ending with the suffix “ide”.The chemical symbol for each element can be found on the periodic table. Unlike covalent compounds, Greek prefixes are not used to indicate the number of atoms of each element. You have to balance the charges of the elements to determine the atoms. For example: Lithium oxide is Li2O.  , Sometimes the cation or anion is a polyatomic ion. These are molecules that have two or more atoms with ionic groups. There’s no good trick to remembering these, you just need to memorize them.There are only 3 cation polyatomic ions and they are ammonium (NH4+), hydronium (H3+), and mercury(I) (Hg22+). They all have a +1 charge. The rest of the polyatomic ions have negative charges ranging from -1 to -4. Some common ones are carbonate (CO32-), sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), and chromate (CrO42-).  , The valence charge can be determined by looking at the position of the element on the periodic table. There are a few rules to keep in mind that help you identify the charges:All group 1 elements at +1. All group 2 elements are +2. Transition elements will have Roman numerals to indicate their charge. Silver is 1+, zinc is 2+, and aluminum is 3+. Group 17 elements are 1-. Group 16 elements are 2-. Group 15 elements are 3-. Remember, when working with polyatomic ions, just use the charge of the ion.  , Once you have identified the charge of each element (or polyatomic ion), you will use these charges to determine the number of atoms present of each element. You want the charge of the compound to equal zero so you will add atoms to balance the charges.For example: Lithium Oxide. Lithium is a group 1 element and has a +1 charge. Oxygen is a group 16 element and has a 2- charge. In order to balance the 2- charge of the oxygen, you need 2 atoms of lithium; therefore, the chemical formula of lithium oxide is Li2O.  , The best way to learn formula writing is to practice with lots of examples. Use examples in your chemistry book or look for practice sets online. Do as many as you can until you feel comfortable writing chemical formulas.   Calcium Nitride: Symbol for calcium is Ca and symbol of nitrogen is N. Ca is a group 2 element and has a charge of +2. Nitrogen is a group 15 element and has a charge of 3-. To balance this, you need 3 atoms of calcium (6+) and 2 atoms of nitrogen (6-): Ca3N2. Mercury (II) Phosphate: Symbol for Mercury is Hg and phosphate is the polyatomic ion PO4. Mercury has a 2+ charge as indicated by the Roman numeral II next to it. Phosphate has a 3- charge. In order to balance them, you will need 3 atoms of mercury (6+) and 2 molecules of phosphate (6-): Hg3(PO4)2.  , In a basic double replacement equation you will have two cations and two anions. The general equation takes the form of AB + CD --> AD + CB, where A and C are cations and B and D are anions. You also want to determine the charges of each ion.For example: AgNO3 + NaCl --> ? The cations are Ag+1 and Na+1. The anions are NO31- and Cl1-.  , Once you have identified all of the ions and their charges, rearrange them so that the first cation is now paired with the second anion, and the second cation is now paired with the first anion. Remember the equation: AB + CD --> AD + CB.Remember to balance the charges when forming new compounds. For example: AgNO3 + NaCl --> ? Ag+1 now pairs with Cl1- to form AgCl. Na+1 now pairs with NO31- to form NaNO3.  , After writing the products that will form in the equation, you can write the whole equation with both products and reactants. Keep the reactants on the left side of the equation and write the new products on the right side with a plus sign between them.For example: AgNO3 + NaCl --> ? AgNO3 + NaCl --> AgCl + NaNO3   , Once you have written the equation and have all of the products and reactants you need to make sure everything is balanced. An equation is balanced only when you have the same number of atoms of every element present on both sides.For example: AgNO3 + NaCl --> AgCl + NaNO3  Count the number of atoms on each side: 1 Ag left, 1 Ag right; 1 N left, 1 N right; 3 O left, 3 O right; 1 Na left, 1 Na right; 1 Cl left, 1 Cl right This equation is balanced because there are equal numbers of atoms on both the left and right side of the equation.  , The only way to get better at writing chemical equations is to actually do it. Work your way through these examples to make sure you really understand the process.   NiCl2 + (NH4)2S --> ? Cations: Ni2+ and NH4+  Anions: Cl1- and S2-  Recombine ions to make new products: NiS + NH4Cl Write the equation: NiCl2 + (NH4)2S --> NiS + NH4Cl Balance the equation: NiCl2 + (NH4)2S --> NiS + 2NH4Cl  ",1285,"['polyatomic ions', 'first element', 'examples', 'number', 'valence charge', 'atoms', 'second element', 'products', 'negative charges', 'full equation', 'reactants', 'chemical symbol', 'element', 'anions', 'prefixes', 'cations', 'equation', 'ions', 'chemical symbols']"

These bones are connected by ligaments and cartilage, including the meniscus, which cushions the area where the femur and tibia meet.   Degrees are used to measure the range of motion in your knees certain activities require. You need 65° range of motion to walk, 70° to pick up something from the floor, 85° to climb stairs, and 95° to sit and stand comfortably.; , As one of the most heavily used joints in the body, the knee is subject to a range of injuries. The more you know, the better prepared you will be to avoid circumstances that lead to or exacerbate injuries.The iliotibial band, or IT band, is the area of thicker tissue that runs from the outside of the pelvis to the outside of the knee. The IT band helps to stabilize the knee during physical activity. It can become inflamed and painful when it is overused, leading to iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS). Runners, hikers, and other active people often experience this injury. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is commonly torn during activities like running, jumping, and landing from a jump. Other ligaments may be torn as well. The meniscus, which acts like a shock absorber to protect the knee joint from impact, can be easily torn during activities like twisting, pivoting, or decelerating.  , The knees are supported by the other muscles in the legs, especially quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Keeping these muscles strong is crucial to having strong knees and preventing injury.   Muscles like the quadriceps, hamstrings, hips, and glutes act as stabilizers for your knee. To help improve your stability, you should exercise and stretch these muscles., Spending some time stretching and warming up your IT band before diving into a strenuous activity is a good way to keep your knees strong.Stand with your left foot crossed over your right and stretch your arms above your head. Lean your upper body as far as you can to the left without bending your knees. Repeat with your right foot crossed over your left, leaning your upper body to the right. Sit on the floor with your legs stretched in front of you. Cross one over the other and pull your knee as close as you can toward your chest, holding it in place for a few seconds. Repeat with your other leg. Take a brisk walk before launching into a more complicated exercise to give your IT band a chance to loosen up.  , If you have had knee surgery or a knee replacement, you may need to do certain exercises and stretches to increase your range of motion. Follow your doctor's instructions on when to start stretching after surgery. Some general moves you can try include:  Seated knee flexion: Sit on a firm chair, and slide one foot back under the chair as far as you can. Your thighs should remain firm on the chair. Hold for five seconds before sliding back forward. Repeat with the other leg. Seated knee kick: sit on a firm chair with your legs bent. Raise one leg slowly until it is completely straight. Hold for five seconds before lowering the leg. Repeat on the other side. Straight leg raise: Lie down with one leg bent and the other straight against the ground. Raise the straight leg up slowly before lowering it back down. Repeat on each side ten times., The quadriceps are the muscles in the front of your thighs. Strong quadriceps will help improve strength and mobility in your legs. Try exercises that target these muscles.   Thigh squeezes may help those who have had long-term knee problems or knee surgery. Lie down with your legs straight. Squeeze the muscles at the front of your thigh, and hold it for five seconds before releasing. Make sure to do this with both legs.Do lunges to work on your quadriceps. Stand upright with your hands on your hips. Take a big step forward with your left foot, and lower your body toward the floor until your left leg is bent at a right angle. Your back knee will lower until it is nearly touching the floor. Repeat this exercise several times, then switch to the other side. Low-impact exercise machines such as a stationary bike or elliptical machine can help you work out your quads with minimal or no impact. These are safer activities for someone who has arthritis or a previous knee surgery than running is., The hamstring is located at the back of the thigh. Doing hamstring stretches once a day and exercises twice or more a week can help relieve knee pain and improve mobility.  Touch your toes. Stand straight, and bend forward while keeping your spine straight and your abs contracted. Straighten back up. If you are having trouble reaching your toes or ankles, place a chair in front of you. Bend forward to try to touch the seat of the chair.Heel lifts might also help. Start by either standing feet parallel and facing forward. Lift your heel back to try to touch your buttocks. Try donkey kicks. Stand behind a chair, and place your hands on the chair back. Raise one foot behind you, with the knee bent. Lower the foot back down to the ground. Repeat with both legs. To do a bridge, lie down with your knees bent. Squeeze your glutes as you slowly lift your hips a few inches off of the ground. Hold for a second before slowly lowering yourself back down. This exercise will not only work your hamstrings but also your hips and glutes., The hip flexors and glutes are both involved in the movement and mobility of the leg. Keeping them strong can prevent putting too much strain on the knee. As a bonus, many exercises that work the hips and glutes also help the hamstrings.  Try a clamshell. Lie on your side with your knees bent. Lift the knee of your top leg, but keep your feet touching. Hold for a second before lowering. Repeat ten or twelve times before switching to the other leg.Squats with a short range of motion are good even for people with knee problems. Stand upright and simply squat to the ground, bending your knees and keeping your back upright. For a less strenuous version of this exercise, practice standing in front of a chair, sitting, and standing again.  , If your leg muscles aren’t strong, your knees won’t be either.   Yoga is a low-impact activity that tones your leg muscles. Swimming is another great way to build leg and knee strength and flexibility because it is a no-impact activity. Walking and biking keep your legs and knees in shape for more strenuous activities.  , Jumping exercises, such as jump rope, can help build the muscles in your leg, but if you do them improperly, it can injure your knees. If you do decide to jump, learn to do it properly. Landing on straight knees puts too much pressure on your joint, and can eventually lead to injury. For stronger knees, practice landing in a half-squat position with your knees bent and your shins vertical. If you cannot land with your shins vertical, then you may have alignment issues. Avoid jumping in this case., Joints become weakened and painful when they are inflamed, so adding foods that are known to be anti-inflammatory to your diet may help keep your knees strong. Fish, flax seeds, olive oil, avocados, and whole fruits and vegetables are said to have anti-inflammatory properties.  , Spinach, broccoli, peanuts, mango and kiwi are excellent sources of vitamin E. , Bone health is also important for knee strength, so take measures to prevent osteoporosis. Cow milk, yogurt, soy, cheese and goat milk are good sources are calcium. Leafy greens are also beneficial.  , If you experience a lot of knee pain doing certain activities, chances are you aren’t strengthening your knees by continuing. Try lower impact exercises for awhile to give your knees a rest. After a few months of focusing on leg muscle strength and flexibility, you may find you’re able to do your favorite activities without pain.

When you're standing in line to order food, have your order finalized before you reach the counter. Don't be shy about ordering a taxi, crossing the street or getting onto the subway. All these things might require a bit of jostling, but if you want it done, you'll push through.   Don't set out to do things with a stormy attitude, but do set out to get them done, no matter what. Know that assertive doesn't equal rude.; , Most New Yorkers wouldn't be caught dead wearing an ""I <3 NY"" T-shirt, or any item of clothing purchased on vacation (such as clothes from Disneyland). Your safest bet is to wear black, dark blue or some shade of grey. When the weather is warmer, white and beige are good choices, but don't be afraid to show off your style in flattering colors or prints.  , Particularly in Manhattan, you won't see people wearing sneakers (too casual) or flip-flops (because they bring your feet too close to the dirty sidewalk). Loafers, heels, boots, and heeled sandals are common.  , Visiting certain places will automatically label you a tourist. If you’re okay with that, then go, take a selfie and a quick look around. Otherwise, steer clear of the following:Times Square Southeast corner of Central Park Theme restaurants, such as Jekyll and Hyde or Bubba Gump Shrimp, or restaurants with lines of obvious tourists like Shake Shack. Top of the Empire State Building. Go to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade instead. The bull statue on Wall Street Certain Broadway shows, such as Wicked or The Phantom of the Opera Little Italy in lower Manhattan. Little Italy in the Bronx will not label you a tourist and is known for real Italian food. Rockefeller Plaza  , There’s not many of these rules, but they're important to keep in mind. The correct pronunciation makes it less obvious you’re not a native New Yorker.   SoHo, or south of Houston Street, is pronounced ""SO-hoe,"" and no-no rhymes with it. Know how to refer to the boroughs. There are five parts of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx. Only the Bronx should be preceded by ""the""; you would never say ""the Staten Island,"" for instance. ""Staten"" is pronounced ""STA-ten,"" not ""STATE-en.""  , In the 1950's, when New York had 3 baseball teams, fans of each were generally based on demographics. For example, Yankee fans were white, Catholic, and from the Bronx, Manhattan, or Staten Island. Now, the city has two teams, but some New Yorkers are still fans of the Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers, even though they have since moved to other cities. Other displaced fans swore allegiance to the Mets.Even if you don't actually like baseball, be prepared to talk about it. It's a common topic of conversation between strangers or acquaintances. If you do, don’t broadcast that you root for the Boston Red Sox, the Chicago Cubs or the Philadelphia Phillies.  , Not only does the lack of traffic spaces make driving a car in New York impractical, but traffic sits in gridlock more often than not. Call a taxi as a last resort; otherwise, walk or take the subway. It will save you time and hassle in the end.  , Because there are so many people on New York sidewalks during the day, the only way to keep some sort of order is to treat it like a freeway. In general, stay to the right side and don’t stop suddenly.If you're walking slowly, move further to the right so that people in a hurry can pass you. If stopping altogether, find a place to ""pull over"" near a streetlight or awning. Walk side-by-side with no more than two people, if you're with a large group. When you walk out of a building, don't just step directly into traffic. Look for an opening.  , Don't just call a phone number for a cab - by the time it finds you, you probably could have walked to your destination and back. Instead, hail one off the street. Flag one down by stepping off the curb, making eye contact with the driver, and raising your hand slightly (you don't have to have your arm totally flapping out). When the cab stops, get in quickly.  , Taxis have a row of lights on top of their cabs. No lights means the taxi is currently engaged. If the two outer lights are lit, the taxi is off duty. If the center light is lit, highlighting a number, the cab is available for service., Taxis will line up in popular areas. Do not just grab any taxi in the middle of the line - walk to the front of the queue and hire that taxi. The drivers are all waiting their turn, and it's your job to pick whoever's next., New Yorkers don't give exact addresses when they get into a cab. Instead, tell the driver which street you want, as well as the two cross streets you'd like to be between. For example, you could say ""51st Street between 7th and 8th."" The cabbie will know exactly what you mean.  , Many times it’s easier to grab a cab or take the subway in NYC, but you can easily request a ride from your smartphone. Load your credit card information with the ride sharing app of your choice and get picked up with a tap of your touchscreen. Because of their popularity, drivers are normally close by., The NYC subway system is the most extensive in America, making it quick and easy to use. Most stations will have maps posted, but you can always ask a fellow traveler for directions. Buy a Metrocard from vending machines at the entrance, keep it loaded in your pocket, and master the art of swiping it smoothly through the turnstile., New York is significantly safer than it was in the '70s and '80s. However, there are still places you probably want to avoid. Brooklyn has the most neighborhoods with high violent crime cases with the Bronx coming in a close second. Here are a few places to steer clear of:Hunts Point Vinegar Hill Fordham Greenwood Heights  , In general, it's safe to assume that everyone you meet is in a hurry. If you need directions, most New Yorkers will probably help you. However, keep your question short and to the point.  , There's an old saying that says you'll be within 5 feet (1.5 m) of a rat no matter where you go in New York. While the rat problem might not be that extreme, you will occasionally see rats and cockroaches in places such as subway platforms. In general, respond with nonchalance. Most cities have rats, because large populations of them like to set up house for entire blocks.The only exception to this rule is if the rat or cockroach is on you or near your food. In that case, make an enormous fuss (as you might be naturally inclined to do) and demand that someone help you get rid of it immediately.  , You're going to pass a lot of people on the street, and friendliness will get tiring. Besides, it’s important to not open yourself up to salespeople, beggars or pick pockets. Stay focused on what you need to do and where you need to go.  , If someone catcalls or whistles at you, try to act like it didn't even register with you. Above all, don't look at your harassers. This can only make matters worse. Don't cheer for the subway buskers. Don't give beggars money. Ignore people handing out fliers. You won’t have time to do the things you need to do if you give attention to everyone who wants it.  , If you need directions, look them up discreetly on your phone or ask a somewhat friendly looking New Yorker. Don't pull out an enormous map, because this will only make it obvious you don’t know much about New York City.  , You might see a lot of intimidating things in the East Village of Manhattan, such as prostitutes, drug addicts or graffiti, but you're probably fine. Manhattan in general is well-policed. Most of the crime coming from neighborhoods has to do with late night revelers in Soho and the Meatpacking district.

By establishing a budget, you'll prevent yourself from overspending. In many cases, you can even narrow down online search results to only show models in your budgeted range.   By using online search features that narrow down models of bed according to price, you'll also save yourself from becoming too attached to models outside your price range.; , Before you make any new bed purchases, you'll need to measure the space available in your room. Some beds may be too large for small rooms, or some beds may be too wide for narrow spaces.   Take a tape measure and determine the length and width of available space in your room. Think about the space a person will need to move around the room freely. A bed that is too big may make it difficult to move easily through the room. Note any protruding parts of the room, like low sills or pronounced molding. These can create obstacles for higher beds., Beds intended for elderly occupants might need to be lower in height. Children may want specialty beds, like bunk beds, canopy beds, or beds shaped like racing cars or spaceships. High school students might want loft beds they can take to college in a few years.   If possible, you may want to ask the person who will be sleeping in the bed what kind of bed they would enjoy most., If you're just starting out life as a young person, you'll probably want an economic, durable bed that fits relatively small spaces. You may not have much space in your dorm room or in the bedroom of a shared apartment, so smaller beds would be ideal in this case. However:If you are more established in your career, have a romantic partner, are planning on getting married, or are in a similar situation, a larger bed will likely be preferable. If the bed you are buying is for a guest room and you only intend on using it for a guest room, a generic bed would likely be best., You can always re-paint a room to change its color scheme to suit the tones of your furniture, but the furniture you'll be pairing with your new bed should be taken into consideration as well. Generally, furniture of similar style and construction work well as a whole set. For example:If the majority of the furniture in the room you'll be adding a bed to is made of a dark wood, like black walnut, you might choose a bed made of a similar material. If most of your furniture is black, you might achieve a contemporary look with a bed that has a black painted wooden frame.  , You may have accounted for height when thinking about the bed's occupant, but the height of your bed also plays a crucial role in storage and comfort. Taller beds will not only be more comfortable for taller people, but will also have more storage space underneath.   You may have to take wall protrusions into consideration when thinking about bed height. For example, a room with a low protruding sill might accommodate a low bed but not a high one., Different sizes of bed suit different age groups and phases of life. Young kids, for example, won't need more than a crib or toddler mattress. A twin mattress should be suitable for most older children and young adults. Twin mattresses can be small for adults, in which case the twin XL, an excellent choice for tight spaces, is best. Common sizes beyond these include:    Full beds, sometimes called doubles, are 53"" (1.35 m) wide and approximately 75"" (1.9 m) long. This bed may be short for some adults.  Queen beds are generally 60"" (1.52 m) wide and 80"" (2.03 m) long. The extra space in queen sizes make it a better fit for couples.  King size beds will be about 76"" (1.93 m) wide and 80"" (2.03 m) long. This allows for the most space a couple can have with a single bed.  California King size beds are mostly available on the west coast. These beds are 4"" (10.2 cm) narrower but 4"" (10.2 cm) longer., You never know how a bed will feel until you lay down on it yourself. Even if you plan on buying a mattress online, you should head to a brick-and-mortar mattress store to try it out before purchasing. Test mattresses by:   Removing your shoes and positioning yourself as you would normally lay down on your bed. Changing your position several times, allowing your weight to settle after each time you re-position yourself. Taking your time while laying on the bed. It may take you up to 15 minutes before you are fully settled on the mattress., A loft is a kind of bed that is raised off the ground. To get into this kind of bed you usually climb into it with a ladder.Loft beds allow you to store furniture, like desks, shelving, and seating, beneath your bed.   Many furniture stores sell pre-made lofts. These can usually be assembled with simple tools. If you're somewhat handy and are looking to save some money, you might build your own loft bed.  , If you have less space in your home, you might want your spare bedroom to double as an office, a puzzle room, a TV room, and so on. Some beds fold up out of sight so that you can use a room for purposes besides a bedroom. Use these to get more function out of your rooms.   Some hideaway beds are designed to fold into walls. You may want to make use of this option to make your spare bed all but disappear when it's not in use., Western style futons are a special kind of bed that can also fold into a couch. If you don't have a spare room for guests, a futon in your family room or living room can be used as a bed when necessary.   When considering a futon, prioritize models with plush, durable cushioning. Futons with poor cushioning can be quite uncomfortable.  , Some beds have built in storage, like drawers and cubbies.Other kinds of bed may have furniture attached or built in, like a desk or bookshelf.These kinds of bed can be expensive, but can save you the cost of having to buy a separate piece of furniture down the road.

However, when you develop these expectations, consider your child’s behavioral skills and abilities at their age. For example, it may not be reasonable to ask your 8-year old to stay seated and quiet for several hours at a time. If you impose expectations for maturity that are beyond the child’s capacity, you set your rules up for failure.Recognize that the part of your child’s brain that controls impulses and emotions is constantly developing, even into adulthood.Ask yourself honestly what rules your child is capable of following so you are prepared to deal with the inevitable behavioral transgressions. If your child has demonstrated that they are able to comply with certain behavioral expectations but does not do so consistently, this is likely an act of intentional defiance. Recognize these situations and impose discipline appropriately. Take time to explain your expectations to your child, free from other distractions like television or toys. You may even want to write them down and post them somewhere in house as teachers often do in elementary classrooms.; , Children throwing tantrums are often trying to provoke a reaction. Yelling, threatening, pleading with them to stop, or simply giving into their demands may or may not stop the tantrum in the short term but will not teach them to behavior maturely. Set an example by staying calm and staying firm on your position. Your child may continue their tantrum for a time but will likely eventually recognize that they are not getting their desired reaction, tire themselves out, and find more mature ways to get your attention in the future.Understand that tantrums are a natural childhood reaction to feelings of powerlessness. While your child will have to learn to deal with situations where they are not in control, you may be able to alleviate these situations by giving them a small amount of control.The best way to give your child a manageable amount of personal freedom is to give them acceptable options rather than imposing a single option. For example, if your child expresses a desire to dress themselves, lay out 2 or 3 acceptable clothing options and let them chose. You can do the same for meal options and recreational activities, among other things. If the tantrum occurs in public and you find it urgent to diffuse the situation, have a backup plan for pacifying them, such as giving them a lollipop or agreeing to do something they like later. It is not good to give in consistently so if you find their public behavior consistently problematic, arrange for homecare when you need to attend a public gathering., Children often feel powerless and unheard, leading to tantrums and defiant behavior. Let your child express themselves and react without judgment or evaluation. Instead, recognize the point they are making and repeat it back to them to express that you respect their feelings and are trying to genuinely understand them. This will not only demonstrate empathetic maturity to them but make it more likely that they will respect and understand your response.If, for example, your child does not want to go to school, instead of insisting or trying to convince them they do want to, ask them why, acknowledge their concerns, and try to suggest ways they can cope with them. After you’ve acknowledged their feelings, then express why they have to attend in simple and honest terms. Accepting your child’s feelings is not the same as agreeing or caving to them. Active listening is about demonstrating maturity and empathy so your child learns by example.  , Providing a clear incentive for good behavior is just as important as deterring bad behavior. When your child does comply with your commands, you should, at a minimum, express gratitude and admiration for their good behavior. Better yet, provide small rewards like extra playtime, extra television time, or their favorite snack., Think of reasonable punishments for specific problematic behaviors before you are confronted with defiance. This will remove emotion from your discipline and prevent you from seeming arbitrary. The more consistently your rules are applied, the more likely your child will adapt to them., Offer your child a consistent privilege, such as the ability to buy a new toy every week or a set amount of internet time per day. Clearly articulate that these are privileges, not rights, and that they will be taken away when they act defiantly.Set a time limit for the removal of privileges, such as no internet for one week. It’s important to express that the privilege needs to be earned back and if the defiant behavior continues, the timespan of the punishment will increase.  , For more severe bad behavior, use timeouts. Studies show that timeouts are the most effective form of negative reinforcement and can serve as an effective deterrent for intentional defiance when administered properly.Give your child a warning first and then a timeout if the bad behavior persists. Send your child to a room with no television, games or internet. Forcing them to stand in a corner or facing a wall can be used as an escalating factor if your initial timeouts aren’t working.If your child is under that age of 6, start by sitting with them during the timeouts and performing a positive activity like reading a book or doing a puzzle together. This will help them adjust to the idea of a cool-down period after a tantrum., Spanking, slapping, or any other physical is more likely to develop hostility than correct the behavior of a defiant child. Even when done with mild force, physical discipline is strongly linked with childhood aggression, anti-social behavior, and mental health problems later in life., If your child’s defiance is extreme and persistent, they may have Oppositional Defiant Disorder. You will need a diagnosis from a psychiatrist to confirm this and clinical talk therapy to treat it.The classic symptoms of ODD include consistently irritable mood, an extreme tendency toward argumentativeness, impulsivity, vindictiveness, and significant behavioral problems at school. ODD is often accompanied by antisocial behavior and self-harm. The symptoms of ODD generally begin to show before the age of 8. The symptoms should persist for a least six months before a diagnosis can be made., ADD and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) are increasingly common diagnoses for children with persistent behavioral problems. You will need a diagnosis from a psychiatrist to confirm this. There are a host of cognitive and talk therapies designed to treat ADD/ADHD as well as stimulate medications like Ritalin and Adderall.ADD is typified by a persistent inability to stay focused. It can also be accompanied by hyperactivity, absent-mindedness, forgetfulness, mood swings, anxiety, and depression. These characteristics are common  , Persistent defiance can be a sign of traumatic stress in children. The cause of trauma can be physical like abuse, bullying, or experiencing a car crash or more emotional like going through a parental divorce or the death of a family member. If your child is expressing bad behavior because of traumatic stress, you will likely need to see a therapist for more information about causes and treatment.A sharp change in behavior and mood after a potentially traumatic event is an obvious sign that it is linked to the event. Anti-social behavior, mood swings, and a loss of cognitive skills problem-solving are also warning signs that bad behavior is linked to trauma.

Mulch made from diseased or insect-infested trees can spread the disease or insects to your hydrangeas. Therefore, mulch must be composted properly to eliminate these potential hazards.   Shredded bark mulch or bark chunks sold in bags at garden centers are the safest option, but many companies that sell bulk mulch also offer a good quality product. Bagged mulch at garden centers should state right on the bag that the mulch has been composted or sterilized. If you are buying mulch in bulk, make sure to ask the company for their assurance that the mulch has been properly processed. If there are huge, steaming piles of mulch at the bulk mulch yard and large equipment used for turning the mulch, this is a good indication that the mulch has been properly composted.; , It is possible to encourage hydrangeas to bloom in your preferred color - pink or blue - by altering the acidity level of the soil. Blue hydrangeas prefer acidic soil, while pink hydrangeas need a more alkaline soil. Therefore, using an acidic mulch will alter the pH of the soil and support the growth of blue hydrangeas.   Spent coffee grounds make a good ‘acid’ mulch – ask your local café if you can take a bag of theirs. They usually throw their coffee grounds away, so this shouldn't be a problem. Other suitable acidic mulches include sphagnum peat moss, pine needles (also known as ‘pine straw’), shredded or chipped pine bark (also known as ‘pine bark nuggets’), or similar mulches made from cypress or eucalyptus.  , Alkaline soil is necessary to produce pink hydrangeas, however it is harder to find alkaline mulches. Therefore you may need to use a combination of neutral mulches and alkaline dressings in order to produce pink flowers.   Try applying a neutral pH mulch (such as regular compost) to the soil surrounding your hydrangeas. This will not make the soil more alkaline, but it will not make it more acidic either. To boost the alkaline properties of the soil, try adding a dressing of ground limestone or chalk on top of the neutral mulch. Alternatively, you can use a slightly alkaline mulch such as the shredded or chipped bark from hardwood trees. Unfortunately this type of mulch isn't alkaline enough to significantly change the pH level of the soil, so you will still need to use one of the alkaline dressings mentioned above.  , Mulch can be a good barrier to protect your hydrangeas from pests such as slugs and snails. The best mulches for deterring these pests are sawdust or pine needles, as the slugs and snails cannot travel across these types of surfaces.   An alternative to using these mulches would be to apply a layer of pest-deterring material over the top of a regular mulch. Such pest-deterring materials include crushed egg shells, finely crushed nut shells, a thin layer of ash or cinders or even a layer of human hair clippings. These materials can be placed around the base of the hydrangeas, on top of the existing mulch.  , Using a mulch mat is a good idea if you want all of the benefits of a good mulch, without altering the pH level of the soil.   A good mulch mat will allow rainwater to permeate the ground whilst keeping weeds at bay and heat in the soil, which will greatly benefit your hydrangeas. However, mulch mats won't break down like regular mulch (unless you purchase biodegradable ones) so the pH of the soil won't be affected by the mat. If you dislike the appearance of mulch matting, consider covering it with a layer of organic material such as bark chips. Mulch mats tend to be especially useful when planting a completely new bed. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for further information on using mulch mats.  , While organic mulches will break down and affect soil acidity, some gardeners prefer to use inorganic mulch materials such as slate, stone or gravel.   These are more expensive than organic mulches (such as leaf mold) but tend to last longer and give a neat, decorative finish to your flower bed. It’s unusual to have to top up or replace inorganic mulches such as gravel, so less maintenance work is required than for organic mulches. However, inorganic mulches may be slightly harder to apply in the first place. In addition to their aesthetic appeal, inorganic mulches have the added benefit of not smelling bad, as some organic mulches do.  , You should aim to apply your chosen mulch to the hydrangea bed in springtime (though the timing isn't overly important).   Mulching the hydrangeas in spring will help to retain moisture in the soil over the dry summer months, which will prevent you from needing to water the flowers as frequently. You should avoid mulching in the wintertime as this causes the soil to retain cold, which is bad for the plants.  , Before you apply the mulch, you should remove any weeds from the flower bed and give them a good watering. This prevents the soil from drying out or becoming clogged with weeds beneath the mulch.  , For best results, you should apply a relatively thick layer of mulch, approximately four inches deep.   As a general rule, finer-textured mulches - such as sawdust - should be applied less thickly (about 3 inches depth) than ones with thick chunky pieces. Larger-textured mulches - such as bark chips - may be applied to a depth of about 5 inches (12.7 cm)., Keep the mulch 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) away from the stems of your hydrangeas. If the mulch is right up against the stems, it encourages dampness, which can lead to root rot.   It could also encourage rodent activity during the winter and subsequent stem damage from the rodents.  , You should replenish the mulch around the hydrangeas every year, in order to keep it fresh.   Do not just pour new mulch over the old - use a garden fork, dirt shovel or rake to loosen and turn the old mulch. This will prevent the mulch from becoming too compacted, which restricts water and air movement. Add new mulch to the old mulch to bring the total depth up to between 3 and 5 inches. , Remember that your hydrangeas will require a bit more water after mulching, because the thick mulch layer will absorb some water before it reaches the roots. Therefore you will need to provide more water to prevent the roots from drying out.

Rather, they'll stick to the front part of the mouth, ignoring the rest of the teeth, which is why you need to take over.If your child insists on brushing their own teeth, you can let them, then take a pass at it yourself to make sure you get all their teeth brushed.; , You can only use a small amount of toothpaste because kids have a tendency to swallow it, especially if it produces a lot of foam. Children two and under should have their teeth brushed only with a soft brush and water. Children between two and six should brush with a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste made specifically for kids. Make sure you're also using a toddler-sized toothbrush so it fits your child's mouth.Check to see that your toothpaste has fluoride in it, as that helps protect against cavities and tooth decay.If, for some reason, you don't have access to children's toothpaste, then use a dab of regular toothpaste only about the size of half of a pea. Your toddler's toothbrush should be replaced every three months., To make it easier, brush your toddler's teeth on your lap. You can reach the whole mouth better, making it likelier that all of your child's teeth will get brushed. Hold the brush at a 45-degree angle to the gum line, and brush all of your toddler's teeth equally, making sure you get the parts of teeth facing inward as well as the parts facing outward.Move the brush in tiny circles across the teeth, rather than back and forth, as that is better on your child's gums.As your child gets used to having you brush their teeth, try doing it with them in front of a mirror so that they can see proper technique. Hold your child's hand in yours and guide their brushing so they can also feel what the motions of proper brushing technique feel like. Make sure you get all the food out of your child's teeth as you brush. Singing a little song or telling a story while you brush can help pass the time more quickly.  , When your child turns two (approximately), they should be able to start learning to spit after brushing. Instruct them to spit in the sink. You can even show them how to do the behavior. Don't let them rinse first, as that will increase the likelihood that they will swallow the toothpaste.You can have your child rinse after they spit.  , Foods like crackers and cereals are high in carbohydrates. They turn into sugars, which can harm your child's teeth. Toddlers have a less mineralized enamel than adults, and the risk of cavities is higher. This is especially true if they eat a lot of sugary foods and don't have good oral hygiene. Try limiting how often you give your child these snacks to help cut down on tooth decay.Also, try to avoid sugary snacks like candy or ice cream. Keep those as a special treat.   Instead, pick snacks like cheese or avocado slices.When you do give your child sugary foods, try giving them to your child during a meal. That way, the sugar is mixed with other foods, causing less harm to your child's teeth. If your child does eat sugary snacks, ask them to wash their mouths afterwards to help get rid of the sugar. Brushing is even better., You may avoid giving your child candy because you know it can cause problems with their teeth. You may not know that juice can be just as bad, particularly if your child drinks it often. Water is a much better choice, as it keeps your child hydrated without soaking their teeth in sugar.Baby bottle tooth decay is a particular case which may also affect toddlers' front teeth if they used to drink a lot of milk or sweetened liquids. One way you can slow down sugar intake is to dilute juice with water.  , Having a regular snack and meal schedule gives your child times when food is not working on their teeth. If your child snacks all day long, this causes their mouths to constantly be in an acidic state, which can damage enamel and lead to tooth decay. Try to space out eating, leaving as long as 90 minutes to two hours between eating., Letting your child have a bottle at night means that milk will sit on your child's teeth.As it sits on your child's teeth, it turns to sugar. Over time, that can lead to tooth decay, even in young children and babies. Therefore, it's best to avoid putting your child to bed with a bottle.In addition, giving your child a bottle at night can lead to choking issues. Never put sugary drinks in bottles, even during the day. That allows the drink to sit on your child's teeth., Switching to a regular cup prevents your child from walking around with a bottle in their mouth. Constantly having it in their mouth leads to sugar staying on their teeth if they're drinking a sugary drink. By about one year of age, your child should be using a normal cup if possible., Some parents like to add honey or sugar to their child's pacifier to make it more attractive for the child; however, doing so leaves sugar on your child's teeth, which can lead to tooth decay. It's best to skip this practice altogether and just give your child a regular pacifier., While some activists have questioned the importance of fluoride in water, fluoride is an important component in keeping your child's teeth healthy, and just brushing with it won't do it. Your child also needs to get it from other sources, such as from drinking tap water.In the past, most cities put fluoride in the tap water, but some have stopped adding it, so check with your public water system to find out. In addition, you will want to ask about the percentage of fluoride to make sure it is not too high — check with your dentist to learn what is an appropriate amount for your child. If your child doesn't get it from tap water, your dentist should have fluoride supplements that can be taken instead. Fluoride is beneficial only in certain quantities — it is possible for your child to get too much fluoride, which can cause dental fluorosis, harming developing permanent teeth.  , Everyone has different germs in their mouths that cause tooth decay, and you can pass those germs to your kids; therefore, it's important that you don't share items with your kids that go in your mouth, such as spoons, toothbrushes, and forks., Just like adults, children should go to the dentist often, usually twice a year, though some kids may need to go every three months.Find a kid-friendly dentist who will work with your child even if they have fears about going to the dentist. Consider asking other parents with kids who they use.Your child's first dental visit should be at about six months, or when your child gets their first tooth, so you may be able to wait up to a year in some cases.One way to help calm a child's fears about the dentist is to let the child know you will stay in the exam room with them the whole time. Hold their hand to feel safe during the consultation and make their experience easier. If the dentist will not allow you to be in the room with your child, then choose a different dentist. If your child is afraid, talk to them about what exactly they're afraid of. Once you know what's causing their fears, you can help find a way for them to deal with them. Ask about sealants. Your child's dentist can put sealants on their teeth to help protect them from bacteria. Ask your dentist if they provide this service.

If a slice of the tomato has great flavor and texture, the juice will come out tasting great, too. Look for tomatoes at the peak of tomato season at your local produce market or farmer's market. Keep in mind that you should be looking for juicy, sandwich or salad tomatoes, rather than paste tomatoes.   Organic tomatoes are better to use than commercially-grown tomatoes that use pesticides. You don't want to be able to taste chemicals in your juice. You can choose one variety or a combination.Early Girl and Big Boy varieties produce more juice, while Roma tomatoes produce thicker juice (if using Roma tomatoes (paste tomatoes), you may want to combine them with some other, juicier tomato varieties).; , Rinse the tomatoes under running tap water and dry with a clean dish towel or paper towels. Simply rinsing the tomatoes should be enough to remove most dirt and bacteria.  , Slice the tomatoes open by cutting each one in half. Dig out the stem, removing any hard part that is not part of the flesh, and cut each half into two equal halves.  , Use a stainless steel or porcelain pot rather than an aluminum one; aluminum will likely react with the acid in the tomatoes causing discoloring and possibly an off flavor., Use a potato masher or a wooden spoon to press the tomatoes, releasing some of the juice. The pot should now be full of a mixture of tomato juice and other tomato parts. You want enough liquid in the pot to bring to a boil.   If the mixture seems too dry to boil, add a few cups of water until you have enough liquid in the pot to boil.  , Stir the tomatoes and tomato juice constantly, so the mixture doesn't burn. Keep cooking until the mixture is soft and soupy. This process should take about 25 to 30 minutes.  , Add a pinch of sugar, salt or other seasonings to flavor your tomato juice. The sweetness of the sugar helps cut back the acidity of the tomatoes.   If you feel unsure about how much sugar, salt, or pepper to use, it is best to start with too little. You can do a taste test before you remove the tomatoes from the heat and add more seasoning, as necessary.  , You do not want them to return to room temperature, but they should be cool enough to reduce the risk of accidental burns.  , Place a sieve or wire mesh strainer over a large glass bowl. If using a strainer, select one with small gaps. Use a glass or plastic bowl, since metal bowls may react with the acid in the tomatoes. Gradually pour the cooled tomato mash through the sieve. Most of the tomato juice should flow through the holes.   Shake the sieve occasionally to unclog the holes and allow more juice to drip into the bowl. Use a rubber spatula to squeeze the tomato mash against the bottom of the sieve. Pressing down on the mash will help squeeze out any juice that is still trapped inside the tomatoes. Discard the solids left behind inside the sieve. These solids will not have much, if any, culinary value.  , Store it for at least 30 minutes before serving. Stir the juice well before drinking. Your tomato juice can last up to one week when kept refrigerated in a tightly-sealed container.  , Use a tomato paste that contains as few additional ingredients as possible. You can also use a 12-ounce (360 milliliter) can of tomato paste to create more juice, but you will also need to double the amount of water you use.  , Select a pitcher with a lid and sealable spout to preserve the juice as long as possible. If using a 12-ounce (360 milliliter) can of paste, use a large pitcher.  , Pour the water into the pitcher with the tomato paste. You can also measure out water using conventional measuring cups, but measuring it with the can will maintain the proportions well enough.  , If possible, use a hand-held blender to make sure that both ingredients are thoroughly combined.  , Stir the ingredients or blend with a hand-held blender until combined. If the tomato paste already included salt, omit it here.  , Dispose of any unused juice after a week.  , To can tomato juice, you'll need quart-size (approximately 1 liter) mason jars with rings and new lids as well as a canner so you can create a sterile seal. It may also be helpful to get a jar lifter to make it easier to remove the hot jars from the canner when you're finished heating them.   Note that it is not recommended to can tomato juice without using a canner. The tomato juice must be heated to a high temperature in order to kill bacteria and ensure the juice will be safe to drink when you open the jars.Either a boiling water canner, a dial-gauge pressure canner, or a weighted-gauge pressure canner will work.  , You may either boil the jars for 5 minutes a piece, or sterilize them by running them through the dishwasher. Set them out on a clean dishcloth to prepare them for filling.  , If you're going to the trouble of canning juice, it's better to make fresh juice than to can juice you made using tomato paste. Make enough juice to fill up one or more quart jars, keeping in mind that you'll need to leave 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of headspace at the top of each jar.  ,, Boiling the juice for 10 minutes kills bacteria in preparation for canning. At this time, you may take one of the following optional measures to further preserve the juice:   Add lemon juice or vinegar. The acidity of lemon juice and vinegar helps preserve the tomato juice. Add one teaspoon per jar.Salt. Salt acts as a preservative as well, and if you wish to use it, add one teaspoon for each quart. Keep in mind that salt will alter the flavor of the juice.  , Leave 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of headspace at the top of each jar. Place the lids on the jars and tighten the rings.  , Follow the operating instructions for your particular type of canner. The standard heating time is between 25 and 35 minutes. When the process is complete, remove the jars and allow them to cool, undisturbed, for 24 hours.,",1083,"['pot', 'seasonings', 'tomatoes', 'medium-sized pitcher', 'milliliter', 'pepper', 'heat', 'cool', 'sugar', 'tomato juice', 'fresh tomato juice', 'non-reactive pot', 'solids', 'stove', 'refrigerator', 'chill', 'water', 'juice', 'quarters', 'canner', 'juicy tomatoes', 'contents', 'boil', 'pulp', '6-ounce', 'dry place', 'seeds', 'tomato', 'times', 'minutes', 'equipment', 'jars']"

If you paint your trim indoors, you don’t have to take extra time to remove it from the walls. However, you’ll be forced to bend over and stand on ladders to paint it, and you’ll be required to tape off the walls and floors.; , To prepare your trim, you’re going to need fine-grit sandpaper (80-grit, 100-grit, and 120-grit), spackle, a putty knife, paint primer, caulk with a caulking gun, and painters tape. For painting, you will need a few high quality paintbrushes proportionate in size to the trim you are painting, foam rollers, and a durable paint. You may choose to use a sealer to finish the trim at the end, as well.Although you may spend more at the start, it will be worth it to buy quality materials for your project. Your trim will look better and last longer if you do. You’ll need to calculate the amount of paint you need based on the total space of all the trim you’re painting. Ask for help with this at a local home center, if necessary.  , Sanding trim will help to remove any oily coating on the wood that might prevent your paint from sticking, and will give a clean, smooth base for your new paint to be applied to. Sanding is an especially important step when you are painting over old trim that is previously stained or painted, or new trim that has a glossy sealer over the top. If you’re working with trim with many layers of paint, start with an 80-grit sandpaper and smooth down the wood. Move to 100-grit sandpaper after that, and finish with 120-grit sandpaper for a smooth base.   If you’re working with trim that is relatively free of stain or paint, you can start with just 120-grit sandpaper. You’ll need to take extra time to sand down sections of trim that have curves or decorative edges.  , This step applies primarily to old trim that you are painting over. Many times there are dings, dents, and holes in old trim, all of which should be repaired prior to painting. Use a bit of wood spackle and a putty knife to fill in and seal over all these damaged areas. Follow the package directions for application, as it may vary depending on the brand you purchase. Allow the spackle to dry completely for several hours before moving to the next step., If you’re painting your trim indoors, you will need to use painters tape to block off the walls and floors prior to priming. Carefully spread it so that all visible areas adjacent to the trim are covered by the tape.  , Pour your primer into a painting pan or bucket, and remove any packaging from your paintbrushes. Work slowly along your trim, adding 1-2 coats of primer to it; this will cover up the woodgrain and underlying color, giving you the best foundation for your paint. Avoid slopping on thick layers of primer, as this will take longer to dry and the strokes/drips will show up under your paint job later., Your first layer of paint is most important, because it will sent the stage for any brushstrokes that might appear in the final product. Realize early on that patience with the first coat of paint will greatly improve the overall look of your trim when completed. Start by pouring your paint into a tray or bucket. Saturate your brush with paint, and wipe off any extra that might be dripping. Start in the center of the trim, and brush back and forth in the same direction, horizontally. When you’ve finished painting a piece of trim, use a foam roller to go over the top of the paint to reduce the appearance of brushstrokes.   As you add paint along the rest of the trim, spend time blending the edges of different paint patches together so as to reduce the appearance of brushstrokes. If you’re painting your trim indoors, you’ll need to ‘cut in’ the trim - meaning, carefully paint along the edge where the trim meets the wall/floor. Paint the center section of the trim after the edges. Wait several hours (or days, if using oil paint) for your first layer to dry completely before moving onto the second coat.  , The goal of the second layer of paint is to smooth out the color and fill in any patchy brush stroke areas. Work along the trim, using the same painting technique as you did for the first layer. You should paint all of the trim with a second coat, even if the first coat looks like it covered everything. Simply filling in patchy areas may seem like a good shortcut, but it will typically leave you with a blotchy end-job. Use your foam roller to smooth out any visible brushstrokes along the trim, when you’re finished.  , Depending on whether you decided to paint your trim indoors or outdoors, what you do now will vary. If you worked outdoors, you’ll need to bring your trim back in and reinstall it in its original location. If you painted your trim indoors, you will need to remove all of your painters tape along the floor and walls, and any other protective plastic you might have laid down.  , Caulking is a final step many people overlook, but which makes a serious difference in the appearance of your trim. Caulking will seal any gaps between the trim and the wall, both protecting it from damage and giving it a more finished look. Carefully spread your caulk around the seam between the trim and the wall. Use your finger as you go, to spread the caulk into the crevice and seal the gap more evenly. Use a damp rag to clean the nozzle on the caulk gun to prevent it from clogging, and to wipe your dirty hands on.You should always use a caulk that is close in color to your trim - typically white. The idea is that the caulk will blend in seamlessly. Wait for the caulk to dry several hours before returning furniture to its original locations.

"['use this method for backcountry hunting', 'settle the carcass onto one side', 'score the hide around each leg joint', 'find the seam in the meat along the hindquarter', 'remove the backstraps', 'remove the meat from the front-quarters', 'go back and remove meat between the ribs', 'carefully remove the tenderloin', 'flip the carcass over and repeat on the other side']",How to Field Dress an Elk3," If you're just after meat, there's no reason to take a bunch of heavy bone back with you. There's a lot of meat on an elk, meaning there will be enough weight to pack out without fiddling around with bones. If you've got a long hike ahead of you, getting the good-quality meat is possible with the right tools and the right approach.With a sharp hunting knife, you should be able to break down an entire elk, just taking the meat, in an hour or two, plenty quick to avoid spoilage. Keep a couple of big plastic garbage bags on hand to get the meat into quickly and get it cooled down.  , Basically, you'll take all the meat you can from each side of the animal separately, working your way from the back to the front. After you've cleaned one side, you can flip the animal over to the other side. It won't matter that the skinned side is getting dirty, since you've already taken all the meat you want from it. It's quick and clean.  , Start working the hide off the hind leg on the side facing up by making a small cut around the lower joint below the ham. Pull the hide away from the meat, working your knife underneath to help unzip the hide and pull it loose as directed in the first section. Keep working until you've exposed the meat on the entire hindquarter.  , You don't have to be an anatomist or a licensed butcher to see where the good meat is. Trim away any fatty layer along the outside of the meat to get a good look at the ham that you've got. There should be a seam, where the major thigh muscle separates from the other leg muscles, providing a nice seam to work down and separate your first big roast or ham of meat from the carcass.   Work carefully, using your hunting knife to make small, clean cuts along the seam, pulling the meat loose in a big chunk as you work. Work down as close as possible to the bone as you can, taking as much as possible. This is some of the best meat for roasting or cutting into steaks on the elk. It's all good. Most of the cuts should just be through membrane, making it relatively easy and quick. Around the pelvis though, keep your knife flat against the bone to work the meat loose and you should be fine. You should spend the most time working at removing meat from the hindquarters. The most meat you'll get out of the animal will be there. Keep looking for the seams that separate muscles, cutting down until you get close to the leg bone, then pulling the meat loose. Place it directly into plastic bags. Continue skinning up the carcass. As you work up the animal, continue skinning as you go, working the hide up and pulling it back to expose the seam, working your knife along to loosen it.  , Work the hide back over the backbone to expose it and remove the backstraps, which are like the outside tenderloin of the elk. These are two long ""straps"" of meat that run along each side of the backbone. You may only be able to get to the backstrap on the side you're working on, depending on how the animal is oriented, but if you know where to look for it, it's some of the best meat to get.   Feel the side of the animal, where the ribs end, then trace upward until you get to the backbone. The backstrap should start about there, and extend all the way along the backbone. To get at it, insert your knife and keep it flat against the backbone, then cut along it, keeping tight into the bone, up toward the shoulders and back toward the pelvis. Separate the backstrap from the pelvis, and at the top near the shoulder blade. Find the seam several inches down the ribs of the animal to separate the backstrap completely. It forms a kind of ""trough"" along either side of the backbone, which you should be able to feel bulging slightly. It's about an inch or two deep and maybe five or six inches wide, running from the shoulder to the pelvis.  , There won't be as much meat from the front quarters are there will be along the back, but there's still a substantial amount. Work the hams off, finding the seams and separating the meat between the muscles. Work your knife until you hit the shoulder bone and separate your flank steak in a long strip.   It's also a good idea to work your knife up along the side of the neck to get the neck meat from that side. There's a lot of it. This is excellent for stewing and slow-cooking.  , Because elk are so big, it's surprisingly easy to get the meat from the ribs without having to bother removing the ribs themselves. You can work your knife along the bone, using each rib as a guide, and separate the meat the connects them. Go slowly and carefully, making sure that you don't push your knife into the carcass too far. Remember, the guts are still in there, making it very important that you work carefully and gently.  , The tenderloin is the meat that runs opposite the backstrap, along the inside of part of the backbone. It's the best meat on the animal, but it's also the most difficult to get to using this method. It's worth getting, though, every time.   Carefully push down the membrane separating the intestines from the last foot or so of ribs, where the backstrap ended. Holding the intestines down, and using extreme caution, use your knife to separate the tenderloin from the backbone, using the bone as a guide and letting your knife do the work. Be extremely careful.  , On a cool day–around 40 F or less–you can pack out all your meat in plastic bags and get it back to your camp to continue cooling down as quickly as possible. On hotter days, it may be a better idea to cool things down more actively.The biggest cause of spoilage is body heat, and not getting the meat cooled down quickly enough. If the temperature is higher than 70 F, you might want to rinse the meat in cool water to bring the temperature down before packing it out.   Aging meat helps to dry it out and improve the flavor. Elk is no different. While you want to get it cooled down as quickly as possible, in temperatures of less than 60 °F (16 °C), the meat should be fine for up to three days. Then cool it below 40 F for up to a week or two.

Lessons should be a combination of learning from lecture and processing activities.A processing activity is one in which students must manipulate information or relate the information to something they already know. This might be an activity like writing an alternate ending to a story they have read, conducting a lab experiment, or participating in a debate with their fellow classmates.; , Studies show that middle school students can only handle 10-12 minutes of direct instruction (or lecture). After 10-12 minutes, their brains begin to filter out information of the lecture and turn to other thoughts. While lecture is an important component of teaching, you need to supplement it with processing activities.If you are giving a lecture, be sure to present it in an engaging way. Don't just read off of a worksheet or set of notecards. Read as if you are telling a story. Be sure to make eye contact with your students as you are presenting the material. Make sure they know that you are speaking directly to them because you want them to understand the material.  , Research has shown that middle school students respond most positively to visual images when they process information. Visual images give students concrete, easily digestible information as opposed to abstract information (which they won't be able to grapple with until they are 18-20 years old).Dynamic visuals -- or visuals that move as opposed to remaining static -- have been shown to have the most significant impact on students. Look for charts that have moving elements, films, or a series of interactive images as opposed to just one or two static images. You should also consider using manipulatives, which are physical objects that students can touch in order to learn material from the lesson. They are commonly used in math (such as using blocks to teach geometry), but you might also consider using objects in other areas, like bringing in an old copy of a magazine from the 1930s if you are teaching history., Middle school students need to interact with information directly in order to fully understand it. They no longer view you, as the teacher, as a fount of knowledge; they need to form opinions about the material on their own.   Incorporate the Think-Pair-Share method. When you are teaching a particular lesson, ask the students a question about the material. Have them write down a response to the question and then share their ideas with a partner. Then, as a class, discuss your responses out loud., As middle schoolers, most students will relate to the world around them emotionally rather than through logic or reason. As you teach your material, be sure to present it in terms of its emotional impact.The extent to which you can do this in each discipline will vary. But you should incorporate methods such as storytelling into appropriate disciplines like English, social studies and even subjects like science and mathematics. Humor is also a key element in connecting with your students emotionally. Make sure your jokes are appropriate and avoid anything bordering on snark or sarcasm.  , Above all, make sure your lessons incorporate a wide variety of activities. Ask your students to take notes, write reflection pieces, work in groups, conduct investigations and play games. This will prevent boredom and help your students develop a broad range of cognitive skills.Be sure to incorporate activities that require memorization and repetition on the part of your students. This is a valuable skill that still needs development in the brain at this age. You can use flash cards, rhyming games or simply ask students to repeat vital pieces of information out loud to practice this. , Encouraging time for your students to write in a journal about what they have learned or how they experienced the lesson for the day will help them see the broader goals of the class., Young adolescents might begin to test the boundaries of authority, but they still need a clear set of rules and boundaries in order to learn.On the first day of class, include your students in the creation of the rules and make sure they understand why they need to be in place. If one of your rules is to respect each other, you should ask your students what this would entail (for instance, taking turns when talking as opposed to speaking over each other).Establish regular routines in your class so your students know what to expect. For instance, you might start each day with an inspirational quote or story relating to your lesson for the day. You can use this routine to warm up discussion amongst your students.Giving your students a syllabus will also help them develop their abilities to plan and organize their study schedules. A syllabus should include the dates of the classes, what you plan to teach on each date, and any reading or assignments that your students should complete before attending that class.  , In middle school, students often start to form deep friendships and social hierarchies. Students can be harassed or ostracized for things ranging to their appearance to their the race, sexuality or religion. Be sure to look out for this toxic behavior and shut it down whenever you see it occurring between students in your classroom.If a student is acting in a disruptive or disrespectful manner in class, then pull them aside (either after class or at a natural lull in the lesson, like when students begin to work independently), to talk with them. Do not express frustration with them but rather, empathy. Say, ""I noticed that you are having trouble focusing on the assignment. What can I do to help you?"" The student might not respond well to a scolding but they will respond to a question that asks them to reflect on their actions and ask for help.Discuss bullying directly with your students. Have them study its damaging effects and ask them to explain why they must avoid hurting their fellow students. Talk to your administrators about implementing a zero tolerance policy toward bullying at your school. Familiarize yourself with any district policies on bullying or disruptive behavior in the classroom.  , The adolescent brain and body needs 10 hours of sleep in order to fully develop. If you have students who consistently struggle to remain awake and complete their work, then you should notify their parents about your concerns. There might be a larger medical problem involved.Encourage your students to drink water. The pre-adolescent brain needs to be well hydrated in order to develop. Encourage your students to drink water in class and at lunch., Between the ages of 11 and 13, students are juggling a huge range of physical and psychological changes. In addition to the increase of hormonal production in the body, they are also dealing with the delayed development of the neo-cortex. The neo-cortex is a frontal lobe in the brain that handles executive processes such as making plans, setting goals, and thinking of long term consequences. This part of the brain is the last to develop and is often not fully functioning in early adolescent students.Until the neo-cortex is developed, the brain processes language through the amygdala, or the emotional part of the brain. This is why adolescents often make impulsive decisions based on emotion rather than reason., The increased production of hormones in the early adolescent's body enacts a number of changes on your students. But one change that might be overlooked is an increased sensitivity to stress.In particular, your students may become stressed by the physical changes in their body, such as the awkwardness of a growth spurt or the development of breasts, pubic hair, facial hair, etc. These changes can make your students feel like they have lost control over their own bodies.  , The early adolescent brain is still developing its social development functions. That means that your students will often be most concerned with themselves first and foremost.Early adolescence is a period where students will need to practice moral reasoning in order to develop empathy and compassion.",1357,"['lesson', 'time', 'classroom', 'lecture', 'reflection', 'brain', 'emotions', 'students', 'amount', 'student', 'social aggression', 'visuals', 'consistent rules', 'chunks', 'physical health', 'mental development', 'selfishness', 'lessons', 'voices', 'stress', 'patient']"

Once you have everything out, you can use this chance to clean your purse as well. A quick and easy way to do this is to turn it upside down and shake it over a trashcan to empty out any debris.; , How you do this will depend on what you had inside your purse and how you organize things; everyone is a little different. In either case, it might be a good idea to put similar items (or items with similar uses) together. Here are some samples of piles to get you started:Electronics Feminine care products Gift cards, coupons, and loyalty cards Makeup Medication Wallet, money, and credit cards Trash  , If it's been a while since you last cleaned out your purse, you might have some items that don't belong, such as: candy wrappers, a pair of extra socks you brought because it was raining, expired coupons, or receipts for items you no longer have. Throw away the items that need to be thrown away (such as candy wrappers) and put away items that don't belong (such as that change of socks).  , Take a careful look at your items. Do you really use that tablet or eReader each and every time you leave the house? Some seldom-used items are important in case of emergencies (such as feminine care products or medication) but other items (such as electronic or entertainment items) are not absolutely necessary.   This does not mean that you can never bring your electronic or entertainment items with you. Pack them in your purse only when you know that you will need them; otherwise, leave them at home. Be selective about your makeup. Limit yourself to just one lipstick shade and one eye shadow palette. You can change them out weekly; the less you pack, the better.  , Since you are organizing your purse, you can take this time to switch it out for a new one. This will force you to be more selective about what you put into your purse. It will also prevent you from stuffing unnecessary items into it, which can lead to clutter., Pouches are a great way to keep your things organized, but they also take up space. If your purse already has pockets in it, then you can use those instead. Pockets are also great at keeping things like cell phones in one place (as opposed to rattling about loosely in your purse).Consider a purse that has a small, exterior pocket. This is great for keys, and makes them easy to grab., This includes things like your wallet, sunglasses, keys, hand sanitizer, and lip balm. If you have any pockets in your purse, consider putting the smaller items (such as lip balm) into them. This will not only reduce clutter, but also make it easier to reach in and grab what you need; you won't have to rustle through your purse for five minutes to find that tiny tube of lip balm.  , Instead of carrying a full-sized lint roller or bottle of lotion, opt for travel-sized ones instead. You will need to refill them more often, but they will save space and make your bag significantly lighter.If you can't find any travel-sized versions of your favorite lotion, consider getting an empty, travel-sized shampoo container and filling it up instead.   Many items come in travel-size, including tissues, hair brushes, and lint rollers.  , A simple pouch will keep similar items together, and prevent you from having to rummage through your purse each and every time you need something.It doesn't even have to be a fancy pouch; a plastic, zippered bag will also do in a pinch. Be sure to have a separate pouch for each set of items; you don't want to keep your coins with your makeup! Here are some items that you can put into pouches:Manicure sets Medication Feminine care products Pens, pencils, post-its, and other stationary items  , Many wallets even have special slots for these types of cards. If you want to get super-organized, sort them alphabetically.See if your loyalty cards are available in app form. This can save you lots of space because everything will be stored on your phone. Store the cards you use the most in your wallet, and the cards you use less often in a separate pouch.  , You can keep them in your wallet or in a mini, accordion-style file holder.You should also have a system in place for them, including how often you go through them and throw them away. The last thing you'd want is to hoard receipts that expired five years ago.   This step can also be used for coupons.  , If you need to take a lot of medications for allergies, pain, headaches, and so forth, consider keeping a few pills in a weekly pill box. Label each compartment with what's inside, such as: pain medication, allergy medication, and so forth.You will have to refill the pill box often, but at least you won't have to carry several bottles of medication in your purse, which can take up a lot of space.   Consider keeping this in a zippered pouch along with other care items, such as dental floss.  , Keeping all of your makeup together will not only make things easier to find, but it will also help keep the inside of your purse clean. You also want to carry the makeup you use the most often with you. This means that, instead of carrying five different eyeshadow shades, you only pack one pallet, and leave the rest at home. The less makeup you carry, the less bulk you will have.   Another option is to omit packing your makeup, and doing it at home. Pack items for touch-up only, such as lipstick, lip gloss, and powder.  , Chances are, you may have a bunch of items that you need in your purse. Instead of letting these items rattle about loosely in your purse, consider putting all of them inside one, zippered ouch. This includes things like earbuds, batteries, notebooks, etc., All it takes is a few extra seconds, but it will keep your purse looking tidy longer. If you start just throwing everything into your purses instead, it will look like a war-zone in no time.This includes putting loose change into a coin purse or your wallet.  , Both of these will help keep clutter at bay. Clearing your purse weekly will also help keep it both clean and clutter-free., This include items like lotion or perfume samples from sales people at the mall, or extra salt/sugar packets from the restaurant. These items usually end up at the bottom of purses, forgotten. Overtime, they accumulate and lead to clutter. Instead, politely decline these offers or use the products immediately., Makeup kits, first aid kits, and feminine care kits can all take up lots of space. You can save that space by keeping them in your car or school/work locker. This way, you will still be able to do your makeup, take your medication, and so forth, but you won't be carrying those items with you all the time.",1198,"['miscellaneous items', 'travel-sized items', 'use', 'credit cards', 'weekly pill box', 'receipts', 'supply kit', 'store gift cards', 'place', 'piles', 'interior', 'free stuff', 'makeup', 'samples', 'loyalty cards', 'medications', 'purse', 'sort everything', 'locket', 'trash', 'places', 'alternate purses', 'pouches', 'car', 'wallet', 'space', 'week', 'items', 'things', 'everything', 'card holder', 'exterior pockets', 'pouch']"

The only way you and your parents will be able to reconcile is if you are each willing to shoulder some of the responsibility.; , It can be difficult to empathize with the pain of estranged parents. You may still have some very difficult feelings to work through, and when something or someone hurts you, it can be difficult to see beyond our own pain.Remember that sometimes the decisions we make when we’re hurt aren’t always good ones. Losing touch with a child can be especially painful, even if they don’t act like they’ve been hurt. Remember that not seeing the pain doesn’t mean it wasn’t there.  , Understanding what your parents were going through when you stopped communicating can help you forgive them, and appreciating what they may be experiencing now will make it easier to find common ground when you meet.Your parents may have been experiencing a low point in their lives when you stopped talking. Remember that parents are nothing more than people, and people struggle with internal and external challenges. All of the feelings of fear and anxiety you have about reconciling with your parents are probably going through their heads too.  , This is an important step that you will need to come to terms with at your own pace. You parents may have done things that truly hurt you, but by trying to consider their perspective and acknowledging that they have felt pain regarding losing you may help you to overcome the desire to blame them. Remember that blame won’t solve anything now, only love can.Acknowledge that you and your parents all share at least some responsibility for losing touch, but that doesn’t mean blame needs to be assigned. Instead of placing blame, focus on the future and how good it will feel to have your parents back in your life.  , While seemingly simple, choosing a place to meet is important because you want to make sure everyone is comfortable and that you can speak without time constraints. Depending on how you and your parents feel, you may choose to meet at one of your homes or maybe a restaurant for dinner.Ask them if they have any preference as to a place you can meet. Depending on the nature of your relationship they may prefer a public place over one of your homes. Meeting at a restaurant offers everyone the ability to leave when they wish, instead of waiting for others to leave their home. That way if things get uncomfortable, you can excuse yourself. Try to choose a time and place that won’t limit the time you can spend talking so you aren’t forced to end your conversation earlier than you each wanted.  , You may be tempted to simply act cordial when you meet with your parents for fear that you may lose touch again if you demonstrate any negative feelings. While it’s important to be polite, you need to be able to voice how you feel in order to begin the healing process.Use “I” statements like, “I felt abandoned when you left.” This keeps your emphasis on you and how you felt. Avoid making accusatory statements like “you never cared.” Instead say, “I felt like you didn’t care.” This allows for the possibility that you can only fully appreciate what was going on inside your mind and that you’re willing to hear what was going through theirs.  , You might regret some of the things you said or did before losing touch with your parents. If that’s the case, tell them so. Saying sorry can make you feel significantly better, and it can help make your parents feel more comfortable as they begin to understand that you are willing to accept a share of the responsibility.No one wants to feel attacked, and by acknowledging that you made mistakes and that you’re sorry for them, you invite your parents to do the same. Apologizing can make you feel better too. If you’ve felt guilty about something for many years, apologizing can feel very freeing; like taking a weight off of your shoulders.  , You may have an idea of what you hope will be said, or things you hope will happen when you meet with your parents, but try not to place too much emphasis on what you hope will happen. Instead allow things to progress naturally without being disappointed that they didn’t live up to your expectations.You may be surprised by some of the things your parents have to say. Keeping an open mind will limit the chances of feeling let down that things didn’t progress exactly how you’d hoped. Everyone processes their feelings in different ways, and sometimes it may take a little longer for some people than it does for others to come around.  , After meeting with your parents, you may want to bring up what comes next before you leave. You may want to set a time and place where you can meet up again. Saying you’d like to continue to see one another can help you and your parents both understand that you hope to end the time you spent without each other in your lives.Your parents may be surprised and pleased to know that you’d like to see them again and that your meeting isn’t simply a one-time thing. Remember that healing will take time, both for you and for them. Setting up another time and place to meet in the future will give you each time to process what has gone on and come back again fresh.  , If you and your parents feel it is necessary, you may want to seek out the services of a family counselor that can help you and your parents work through some of your more difficult feelings.   Counselors can offer suggestions for things you and your parents can do to reconnect after so many years apart. Working with a counselor can help ensure your conversations don’t stray into unproductive or hurtful territory like blaming one another and not trying to understand each other’s feelings.  , Giving your parents validation for their presence in your life can help strengthen the new bonds that you are creating. Ask them for advice on things they know a lot about, or let them help you with a project around the house.   Giving a productive reason for continued interaction with your parents can help you establish new and beneficial emotional connections with them. Your parents likely want to help, so by making subtle gestures like simply asking their opinions on what new car to buy, what color to paint your living room or where to get a good deal on a new grill can make them feel like they’re bringing something positive to the table.  , As your new relationship develops with your parents, remember that positive relationships are two way streets. You may want your parents to be there for you as they haven’t been in a long time, but they may also be struggling with emotions that they aren’t sure how to deal with.Be patient and understanding when your parents open up to you about their struggles. Say things like, “I’m here for you, that’s what family is for,” to emphasize the bond you are recreating with them and that it’s a relationship you are willing to work to maintain.  , Remember that Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither are good relationships. There will be challenges, hurt feelings, and maybe even arguments as you work to re-build your bond with your parents. Allow your relationship to develop as slowly as it needs to, and allow your parents (and yourself) an opportunity to take a step back and process your feelings at your own pace.   Don’t expect everything to feel better right away. Long standing emotions take time to dissipate. Your parents may not respond as quickly as you do, or you may have trouble overcoming some feelings that they don’t. Respect that each of you will have to process your new relationship in your own way.

Jobs will be available online at company websites and also on job search websites.    Write a resume and cover letter template which can be personalized for specific positions. If the application is handwritten, fill out the entire application in neat block letters. Do not use script, because Americans can have problems reading writing from other countries. Provide references in the United States if possible. Offer an interview via Skype or other web conference. Many companies will ask for many interviews with different people. Send a thank you letter 3 to 4 days after your interview. In traditional companies, a paper letter is appropriate. For high tech jobs, you can follow up via email.; ,   You can offer to do consulting work (paid by the hour) in your home country with the company in the USA for several months, so they can better get to know you. You can offer to visit the company in the USA to get to know them before you get the job.  , Many have found success to moving to America as a student on a student visa, and then finding employment after you are in school.   This only works if you can be admitted and pay for a school of course. It is best to choose a school and/or degree that makes it easy for you to get a job. Technical majors will find it easier to be sponsored for a visa by an American company.  , A green card gives you permanent residence in America while a Visa is temporary. However, most people will get the work visa first, move to America, and then apply for a Green Card after some time.  ,, You may want to hire a lawyer to help you navigate the different visas, or trust in your company HR department.   The Specialty Workers, or H1B Visa is designed for immigrants who wish to work in a specialized field. Ask the company you are applying to if they will ""sponsor you for an H1B."" Many companies will. They will need to pay about $25,000 in lawyer costs, but if you are in demand, it may be worth it to them. If you are unsure, you can ask them ""if they will sponsor you after 6 months if things are working out well."" The Temporary Skilled or Unskilled Workers, or H2B, Visa is provided for immigrants who want positions that are non-agricultural but are temporary in nature. The Intracompany Transferees, or L1, Visa is for immigrants who will be working for a company that has operations in America. The employee must also be part of management or provide a specialized skill. If you are working for a large company with offices in the USA, ask people in the USA office about this. Employment-based Preference Visas are for those immigrants who are already employed, as this visa must be requested by the employer.  , Countries that are very friendly with the USA typically have better arrangements.   The E3 Visa is designed for citizens of Australia who are employed in America in a specialized capacity. Canadian and Mexican citizens can apply for a TN Visa. Special instructions for Canadians can be found here.   , Entrepreneurs should examine the Choose Between L1 or E Visa to Set Up a New Business in the U.S L1 and E Visas. E2 Visas are well known because they allow you to get a Visa by simply investing money in a USA business, but note it does not have a path to a green card.  , Choose several cities that you find appealing. You can probably find somewhere jobs for you are plentiful, and that you'd like to live in as well.   Look for cities that have affordable housing and living costs, a wide selection of jobs, available housing, good healthcare facilities, and schools and places of worship adequate to your needs. You also should consider if you have friends of friends or others from your country in that area. Weather in the United States is quite varied; research the seasonal averages to ensure you are comfortable with the local extremes or natural hazards, such as earthquakes or hurricanes.  ,   Look at pay for your profession. Examine the Bureau of Labor statistics regarding wages by section of the country and job category to get an idea of the salary you may be able to negotiate in various regions of the country. You can also look on job search websites such as craigslist.com, linkedin.com, indeed.com or others. The Occupational Outlook Handbook provides in depth information about job prospects in most major fields. The information is updated annually and includes information about education or experience needed for the type of job as well as an outlook and a general description of job duties.  , Some cities are better than others, depending on what you do.   The coasts, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles are very expensive. You may find those places attractive if you have a very highly paid profession, such as Engineer, Programmer, Mathematician and so on. If you have a profession that ""can go anywhere"" such as nurse, school teacher, doctor, you may want to look for a smaller town that is cheaper to live in and may have not enough professionals. If you are an entrepreneur, you may find smaller towns cheaper, yet less welcoming to foreigners.  , Rent an apartment or house near your new job when you go to America. Know that many landlords consider a foreign tenant to be risky, and you may need to put up a larger deposit or provide more references.   If you sign up for a longer term apartment rental, you will need to put a deposit on the apartment you wish to rent, usually at least 1 month's rent plus a damage deposit. You may need to provide references and information about your credit rating to potential property owners. Most utility companies also require deposits before services may begin.  ,   A good option is to rent an apartment for just one month while you figure out where you want to be. AirBnB is a good website for this. Craigslist is also good but is a bit more risky. Search for 'short term' and you will see many owners who want to let out their place on short term basis. #*If you know people in the city where you will move, you can ask them directly to stay with them for a short period of time.  , Not everyone gets insurance.   Check with your employer on their health insurance policies. If they do not provide, you will probably want to find health insurance on the open market.  , Public schools in America are free until Grade 12, but they have very different quality. Some can even be dangerous.  , After some time in your job, you can look into applying for a Green Card.

The dietitian will be able to teach you about diabetes, how food affects your condition and how to appropriately take your medication. They will also teach you about what foods are beneficial and what foods are more harmful to your body with diabetes. In addition, they may also give you sample shopping lists or meal plans to use. If you're having trouble figuring out what to eat exactly, talk to your dietitian for further support and education.; , A balanced diet is always important to general health and wellness, but even more so when you have diabetes. Following a well-balanced diet can help keep your blood sugar in check.   A balanced diet is one that contains foods from every food group and a wide variety of foods from every food group.Always measure portions sizes as well. Part of a balanced diet is eating foods in the right proportions and in the appropriate serving sizes. Appropriate proportions and serving sizes of foods are the top factors that will influence your diabetes. If you eat too much of a certain food or eat certain foods too frequently, you may notice you have trouble managing your blood sugars.  , Eating adequate protein is an important part to a balanced and nutritious diet. In addition, protein is naturally carbohydrate-free and can be eaten without worrying about your medications or insulin.   Include at least a serving or two of lean protein at each meal and snack. Protein helps keep you satisfied throughout the day.Like all foods, make sure to measure your portion sizes. Aim for a 3-4 oz portion of protein or a piece the size of a deck of cards.Choose lean protein sources like: poultry, eggs, seafood, legumes, tofu, low-fat dairy, lean beef or pork. If you have diabetes, you're at a higher risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease.Eating fatty cuts of meat regularly or in large portions can also increase your risk of heart disease. Stick to leaner cuts of protein to avoid this.  , Another food group that is very low in carbohydrates and sometimes completely free of carbohydrates are non-starchy vegetables.   Aim for at least 3-5 servings of these foods everyday.Not only are they naturally low carb or carb-free, they are also low in calories, but high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Many health professionals recommend including a serving or two at each meal or making half of your meal a non-starchy vegetable. Measure out 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens per serving.Try vegetables like: salad, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, peppers, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, green beans, onions or mushrooms.  , Although there are certain types of fat you should limit, heart healthy fats like omega-3 fats can actually be beneficial for those who have diabetes.Studies have shown that including 1-2 servings of healthy fats each day helped decrease LDL (bad cholesterol) and decrease triglycerides in patients who had diabetes.Include some of these heart healthy fats on a daily basis: olive oil, canola oil, olives, nuts, nut butters, seeds, avocados, salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines.  , Drinking adequate amounts of fluids and staying hydrated is essential for every healthy body, but also important for those who have diabetes.   Staying hydrated can help regulate blood sugar in your body.Drink adequate fluids daily to help prevent dehydration. Health professionals recommend drinking 8-13 glasses of water and other hydrating fluids daily (the same goes for those with diabetes).Stick with caffeine-free and sugar-free beverages only. Try: water, flavored water, sparkling water, decaf coffee and tea.  , Starches (from foods like grains, starchy vegetables or legumes) do contain a high amount of carbohydrates. However, many sources are very nutritious and should be included in your diet to help maintain blood sugar throughout the day.Starches coming from foods like corn, potatoes, carrots, beans, lentils or whole grains are still nutritious foods. They offer fiber, vitamins and minerals that are essential to your overall health.You do not need to avoid to cut out these foods if you have diabetes. However, since they are high in carbohydrates, you need to monitor how much you're eating and follow appropriate portion sizes. Making about a quarter of your plate one of these starchy, higher carb foods is a great way to still enjoy these foods, without over doing it. You can also measure out 1/2 cup of any of these foods for the appropriate portion size., Although fruit does contain carbohydrates (a sugar known as fructose) it can still be a nutritious and tasty addition to your diet.   Fruit is typically thought of an ""OK"" food to eat with diabetes in appropriate portion sizes because it offers minimal calories, high amounts of fiber and lots of vitamins and antioxidants.Although fruits are nutritious, you still need to count them as a carbohydrate and account for them in your daily total. Fruits with the lowest amount of carbohydrates or sugars are berries like blueberries, blackberries, raspberries or strawberries. You can have 1 cup per serving.Dried fruit should be limited to 2 tablespoons since this is a more concentrated source of sugar.If you're choosing frozen or canned fruit in it's own juice or 100% fruit juice, stick to 1/2 cup per serving., Grains like bread, rice or pasta aren't something you need to avoid or skip if you have diabetes. However, you should choose 100% whole grains when you do eat these foods.   100% whole grains are minimally processed and contain higher amounts of fiber, protein and other essential nutrients.Measure your portion sizes of these foods to 1/2 cup or 1 oz per serving.Refined grains like white bread, white rice, plain pasta and other foods made with white flour or added sugars are lower in fiber and other nutrients. They're considered empty calories and can spike your blood sugar more than whole grains.  , One group of foods that you should limit and eat infrequently are those that are highly processed and contain a lot of added sugars.   Added sugars are those that are added to certain foods during their processing. They make foods higher in calories and carbohydrates. In addition, these foods provide no nutrition and can spike your blood sugar. If you choose to have a sweet treat, stick to a small serving. For example, 1 3"" cookie, 1 tablespoon of honey or maple syrup or 1 small donut.Limit foods like: ice cream, candy, cookies, cakes and pies, breakfast pastries and muffins.  , The glycemic index is a way to measure different foods and their levels of carbohydrate. Using this can help you choose foods that have carbohydrates more wisely.   The glycemic index is a tool that can be used for diabetes. It shows how certain foods affect your blood sugar and insulin levels.Low glycemic foods do not affect your blood sugar all that much, whereas high glycemic foods can increase your blood sugar greatly.Examples of low glycemic index foods are: oatmeal, most fruits, starchy vegetables and 100% whole wheat bread. Examples of high glycemic foods are: white bread, white rice, popcorn, rice cakes and candy. The glycemic index isn't fool proof. Always use your best judgement when choosing foods to include in your diet.  , With diabetes, its essential to monitor your blood sugar regularly. This will help you manage your diabetes and help you decide what foods to eat.   Testing your blood sugar regularly and tracking your numbers is important. Always have this information ready to give your physician or other healthcare professionals so they can help manage your condition. Also, testing your blood sugar will help clue you in on how your diet or certain foods affect your blood sugar.  , Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle for everyone. However, if you have diabetes it can help manage your blood sugar.   Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise, helps to: lower blood sugar, improves insulin sensitivity, improves circulation and decreases your risk of heart disease.Aim to include about 150 minutes of aerobic exercise each week plus 1-2 days of strength training.Note that some exercises that are high in intensity or long in duration can cause a low blood sugar. Always track your blood sugar numbers and have a high carbohydrate snack or drink handy to help remedy a low blood sugar., With any chronic condition, it's important to keep in touch with your physician on a regular basis.   Your physician or endocrinologist will be your link to managing your diabetes. He or she will be the one prescribing medication, educating you on diet and giving you any additional advice or suggestions. Always keep your physician informed of any new or worsening side effects or symptoms of your diabetes or diabetes medication. Keep them updated on your diet, exercise and blood sugar numbers so they can treat your diabetes effectively.

You will also need a pencil, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. To create the two slits:   Along one of the two 18 inch sides, measure and mark the following lengths in order: 6 ¼ inches, 1 inch, 3 ½ inches, 1 inch, and 6 ¼ inches. The two 1 inch sections will serve as the bases of the two triangular slits. To create the legs of the two triangles, measure and mark a 3 inch line from each end of the 1 inch base. Cut out the two 3-by-3-by-1 inch triangles.; , To form the hat, you will make four folds. The first fold will create the brim. The other three folds will create the back of the bonnet.   Create a 2-by-18 inch fold along the paper’s uncut edge. Fold down the center flap (the section between the two triangular slits). Fold the outer two sections over the center section so that they overlap. Staple the outer two sections together or run a piece of scotch tape along the seam., Cut out two 12-inch pieces of white ribbon. On each side of the bonnet, attach one ribbon under the brim with a piece of scotch tape. Place the bonnet on your head and tie the ribbons in a bow under your chin., On a flat workspace, set out a piece of black poster board, a ruler, a pencil, and a pair of scissors. While you can create your own hat shape, you may also use the measurements listed below. To create the pattern, lightly draw the following lines on the poster board:   Draw a 5 inch (12.7 cm) horizontal line near the top of the black poster board. This line will form the top of the hat. Draw two 10 inch (25.4 cm) angled lines from the ends of the 5 inch (12.7 cm) horizontal line. These two lines should be angled out towards the respective edges of the poster board. Connect the two angled lines with a horizontal line. This line will form the base of the hat and should be parallel to the 5 inch (12.7 cm) line. Draw one 1 inch (2.54 cm) vertical line up from each end of the base line, so that the 1 inch (2.54 cm) lines are perpendicular to the base line. Connect the top of each 1 inch (2.54 cm) line to the 10 inch (25.4 cm) lines with a horizontal line. This will create the illusion of a hat brim. Cut out the hat along the lines., A headband will attach to the backside of the hat. To create the headband:   Measure and mark three 1-by-10 inch (2.54-by-25.4 cm) strips of black poster board. Carefully cut out the strips. Staple two of the strips together at the ends. Wrap the two strips around your head. If the band does not wrap around your head, add the third strip. Place the hat upside down on the table so that the pencil marks are facing up. Lay the band across the base of your hat and center it. Staple the band to the center of the hat., On a piece of gold cardstock, measure and mark a 3-by-3 inch (7.62-by 7.62 cm) square. Inside the first square, create a 2-by-2 inch (5.08-by-5.08 cm) square. There should be a 1 inch (2.54 cm) edge between the two squares. Cut out the larger square and then cut of the smaller square. Glue the square to the center of the hat.   In addition to the gold buckle, you can add a brown band that sits just above the brim of the hat., Once the glue is dry on the buckle, pick up the hat and carefully wrap the headband around your head. Ask a friend to mark where the two bands overlap. Take the headband off, match up the two marks, and staple the ends together.   If there is a lot of excess paper, you can trim the ends of the band., Lay your white 12-by-18 inch piece of white construction paper on a flat surface. Fold the paper in half lengthwise. Fold the paper in half widthwise. With a pair of scissors, round the open corner of the folded paper (the corner not attached to any seams)., Unfold the paper once so that the paper only has one crease. Draw a 6 inch line centered along the folded edge of the paper. Connect the two ends of the line with an arc. Cut out the semicircle., Unfold your paper the rest of the way. Cut a slit along the central fold that runs from one of the 12 inch sides to the neck hole. Stop once you reach the neck hole., Cut two 12-inch pieces of yarn. With a piece of tape, attach one piece of yarn near the collar to the left of the slit. Attach the second piece of yarn near the collar to the right of the slit. Put on the collar so that the slit runs down the front of your chest. Tie the yarn in a bow., You can assemble an iconic female pilgrim costume with clothing from your own closet. Put on a long black skirt, a black long sleeve top, and a pair of black dress shoes. Complete the look with your homemade bonnet and collar.   You may add a white apron to the costume too., You can pull together a costume that matches the iconic, albeit mythical, depiction of a male pilgrim with items from your own wardrobe. The basic costume consists of black dress pants, a black button up shirt, and a belt with a gold buckle. If you don’t have shoes with gold buckles, cut out two paper buckles and tape them onto a pair of black dress shoes. Complete the look with your homemade hat and collar., Contrary to popular belief, pilgrims didn’t dress in all black or accessorize with gold buckles. While they wore black and gray clothing to church on Sundays, the puritanical pilgrims wore colorful clothing throughout the week. Instead of gold buckles, which were extremely expensive and not popular at the time, the pilgrims laced up their pants and shoes with leather ties. If you want to dress as an everyday pilgrim, wear simple, colorful clothing, shoes that tie, a collar, and a hat or bonnet.",1064,"['paper headband', 'paper', '12-by-18 inch piece', 'slit', 'traditional male pilgrim costume', 'bonnet', 'headband', 'collar', 'quarters', 'head', 'hat pattern', 'triangular slits', 'traditional female pilgrim costume', 'white construction paper', 'neck hole', 'corners', 'ties', 'gold buckle', 'correct pilgrim costume', 'hat']"

Take a shower when you need to and keep your hair clean. Brush your teeth and use deodorant, to keep yourself smelling fresh.; , Keep your hair brushed, your nails reasonably trimmed, and any excess body hair should also be carefully maintained to reasonable lengths.  , Use only enough concealer, foundation and powder to even your skin tone and cut down on shine. Eye shadow and lip colors should be subtle and use neutral tones line browns and grays. Eyeliner and mascara should be minimal.   There are occasions, however, where bolder lip colors may be appropriate. If you are going out for a formal evening, for example, bright red lips may be warranted.  , When you think elegant women you usually think Audrey Hepburn, Veronica Lake, or Nicole Kidman. And what do they have in common? That sleek, beautiful hair, of course. Choose hairstyles which show off the satin quality of your hair and compliment your features and dress style. This will give you a more elegant look.  , Good choices for nail polish are pale pink, clear, or a french manicure. But remember that any colour can look elegant, it all depends on how you carry it off. Don't rule out any colour - including black - unless you don't like it. Look at some photos of celebrities' nails at events. They wear all colours, including black, green, and orange, and many of them still look elegant.  , You may not see when someone smells nice but it will form a certain picture in your mind. Leave a lasting impression by using a subtle perfume, applied correctly. Elegant top notes include scents like:   Jasmine Rose Amber  , Having good posture will go a long way towards being perceived as elegant. Work on your posture and make sure that you are standing nice and tall. This will also make you look thinner and curvier.  , Avoid clothes which look overly casual, dirty, stained, or ruined. Don't wear clothes that have holes or otherwise look distressed. Try to go out in nice - smart but simple- clothes when you run errands.  , Avoid trendy clothes like bell-bottom jeans or over-sized shoulder pads. Instead, opt for classic cuts on most items of clothing. This will keep you looking timelessly elegant. Knee length skirts with even hem lines, tailored button-down shirts in men's style, and knee-length trench coats are among a large number of classic cut items.  , Make sure that the clothes you do have fit. They should not be too small (showing or creating bulges) or too large (hanging from your frame). Don't get married to a size, every time you try on new clothes, also try on a size up and a size down. Get items tailored, if you can, to ensure an even better fit.  , Lean away from cheap acrylic material or cheap cotton and opt for clothing made from more luxurious materials. This will show and make your clothing look more expensive, even if it isn't. Silk, satin, modal, cashmere, Chantilly or other quality lace, many sheer fabrics, and limited velvet are all acceptable options. Thick materials that add bulk should usually be avoided, as these will detract from your smooth lines.  , When choosing colors, go for high contrast colors that are very light and dark compared to each other (red, white and black, for example). Classic neutral colors also work well (grey, beige, navy, plum, emerald green, champagne pink, etc.).   Other elegant color combinations include blue and gold, pink and white, and white and teal/seafoam.  , Keep your outfits simple: not too many accessories, not too many layers. Avoid patterns and pattern mixing. Don't get overly showy, either. Jewelry should be simple and should go with what you are wearing and doing. Don't wear anything that is too dressy for what you're doing: go for nice, but not unreasonable.   For example, a cocktail dress is a bit much for going grocery shopping but a black or navy pencil skirt, a cream-colored sweater and brown jacket and boots are about right. Sweats would be the bad choice; too casual.  , Choose accessories which compliment your outfit without going over the top. Accessories should also compliment your features and physique. For example, avoid wide or large earrings if you have a big face, or wear vertically striped stockings to make your legs look longer and thinner.  , Don't wear clothes that reveal too much skin, are too tight, or use materials which look low-class (leopard print, fuzzy materials, lamé, etc). Dressing this way can make you look cheap or like an escort. It will also make you look like you're trying too hard. Dress classy by following the advice above and avoiding these pitfalls, and you'll look elegant all the time.  , Use proper grammar, a broad vocabulary, avoid contractions and colloquialisms, and enunciate when you speak. This will make you come across as classy and elegant, a real lady. If you aren't in the habit of speak well like this, practice while you are alone, possibly in front of a mirror.   Do not feel like you have to take on a different accent in order to sound more elegant. The accent is rarely as much of a problem as vocabulary and grammar.  , Do not get overly emotional, either very sad (dramatic crying) or angry (yelling at people and making a scene). This will undo every bit of elegance in an instant. Instead, be calm and relaxed.   Remember: if you're not going to die (and neither is anyone else) it's probably not that big a deal. Breathe and take things one step at a time. If you find yourself unable to stay calm, excuse yourself and go somewhere private until you calm down.  , Like not getting too emotional, you should also give off an air of not caring. This will make you seem more classy and elegant. Getting overly excited or enthusiastic can easily make you seem child-like and immature.  , Don't be passive-aggressive or sarcastic when things go wrong. Just get through all situations with perfect politeness. Treat everyone as if your grandmother were watching you and there was a nice piece of candy in it for you.  , Walk like a supermodel no matter where you are or how you're dressed. Take care not to fall or trip when walking in high heels Don't try to dance above your skill level. If you want to improve your grace, then practice walking, in heels, up and down stairs, etc. You can also practice your hand and leg movements in a full length mirror.  , Of course you don't have to actually be confident (for a lot of people, it's mostly an act) but act as confident as you can. Tell yourself you're beautiful, intelligent, and that you know what you're doing...because you are and you do! Project confidence out to others by not constantly apologizing, for pursuing the things that you want, even if they aren't popular,  , Real ladies have perfect manners. Practice good manners as you go about your day and especially when you eat. Don't ever burp or fart in public. Hold doors open for others and wait your turn for services. Drive courteously. And of course, eat without making a mess or being gross.  , Don't act dumb just for the sake of it. Sometimes people act dumb to stand out. While you may stand out that way, it won't be in a way you want! Be careful also not to act like you know everything about every subject. Talk about subjects you truly know about or say you don't know much about the topic. Your honesty will be appreciated.

However, if you are resigning without other employment lined up, you will have to find a way to cover your living expenses. How will you pay for your standard of living without the current income from your job? If this is a conundrum, it might be best to stick it out a while longer.   If you will need to rely on a new job's income, make sure that you have already clarified the details of your new job. This includes a signed contract or offer letter and a defined start date.Remember that your employee might owe you money from unpaid wages, unreimbursed expenses, and balances in your health insurance, life insurance, or company benefits plans. Figure these amounts into your financial planning.; , The immediate problem of post-job health insurance coverage is one that troubles many individuals and families. As health care becomes more expensive, many rely on their employers to help pay premiums. Of course, this problem is particular to countries without a public health system, where a broader distribution of healthcare gives individuals more freedom to choose their work opportunities.   If you are moving to a position with fewer health benefits, go ahead and get procedures done while you are still on your current employer's insurance., There probably aren't any overriding issues in your job contract. However, reading over it before resigning will help you figure out if any of the fine print issues included in this agreement will impact your decision at all. Look for contract clauses or non-compete agreements that will affect future employment prospects.  , When you resign from your current position, where will you go? Are you taking time away from work or moving on to a new position as soon as possible? Ideally, you should have an offer in place for a new position when you resign. If you don't, you'll need to consider your options for finding employment. Figure out your present employer's policy on references for future employment, as you'll likely need them to find a new job.  , Resigning in person is always the best and most respectful way to quit a job. However, in some cases doing so is not feasible. If your boss works far away, is away from the office for a long period of time, or has never met with you in person, a phone call is a perfectly acceptable method of resigning. You should always resign by phone rather than resigning by email. If time is a constraint, choose notifying your employer by phone immediately over doing it in person and not providing adequate notice., There's no point in embarrassing yourself with an overemotional appeal, or inflaming feelings at the head office. When you've decided you want to resign over the phone, pull yourself together and make an effort to do this politely. You'll often find you have a better chance of an amicable solution to your problems if you do this. Try to frame your decision to leave in a positive light, even if you are leaving for decidedly negative reasons. For example, try focusing on the opportunity afforded by your new position.Try calming yourself down with a couple of deep breaths. If that doesn't work, talk into a mirror to reassure yourself that you're making the right decision in leaving this role.  , When it's time to pick up the phone, you'll want to effectively reach someone with authority to make your resignation effective. You can try the human resources department directly, or call up your direct supervisor or manager. If your manager cannot be reached, try reaching out to their direct supervisor. Even if your resignation will be handled by HR, always let your own manager know first. This will give them adequate time to prepare for your absence., The standard throughout most of the working world is giving two weeks notice for resigning from a position. However, this will vary by employer and position. For example, some positions may require that you cease your duties immediately after tendering your resignation. This is usually to protect sensitive information. However, if no guidance as to resignation timing is provided, follow the two week rule.   Be very clear about the date of your final day., When talking to your boss, open by clearly stating your intentions. A good, standard way to phrase this is, ""I offer my resignation effective ."" If it helps, soften by the blow by saying something like, ""I understand this may not be the best time, but..."" or ""I appreciate the experience I have had here"" or ""This was a difficult decision for me."" Allow your boss to negotiate with you about your specific departure date, unless you are starting your new job immediately after., Leave on a good note by speaking kindly of your time in the position you are leaving. Don't burn bridges; it costs you nothing and you will reap benefits down the road. Talk about how you have developed professionally during your time there. Then, provide your manager with a reason as to why you are leaving, whether it is due to disagreements with the employer or if you are leaving to take a better position elsewhere. However, be as polite and objective as possible.   If possible, limit the specifics that you provide about your new position or future plans. You can tell your manager or coworkers about it in casual conversation at a later date, if you wish.Some good examples of an explanation as to why you are quitting include:  ""I need to move on with my career and have found a promising next step."" ""are a better fit to where I want to be professionally."" ""I am happy here but the other employer made me an even better offer."" ""It is an offer than I cannot refuse."", You may be required to provide a resignation letter in addition to your resignation by phone. However, you don't need to write anything complex. You can write a detailed resignation letter if you wish, but most employers don't require a long one if they require one at all. All that you will likely need to provide is a statement that says that you are resigning and an effective date. You usually don't even need to include a reason for leaving.   Check for company requirements for resignation to make sure that you are following them., Transfer over all purely-personal files on your company phone, tablet, and/or computer, if you have them. Odds are, the company will take these from you and wipe them clean when or soon after you announce your resignation. Make sure to get personal files off of them or back them up online beforehand. Just make sure not to copy any files that contain proprietary company information, including customer or prospect lists. This could subject you to criminal penalties., Work with HR to figure out how you can move your 401(k) or 403(b) over to a new employer. You'll need to figure out exactly how to transfer retirement funds on both sides, and complete all requirements for doing so, before switching to your new position. Make sure to take special care so that everything goes smoothly, because you don't want to lose your retirement fund.Other benefits issues to settle might include life and health insurance, purchase of a company car or other assets, and payment for unused vacation time, among others. Work with HR to ensure that you are duly compensated for these benefits or that they are transferred to your new employer.  , Find a good time to clean your personal items out of your office. If you are asked to leave immediately, you may have little time to do this. Otherwise, you will likely have time to go back to your office, perhaps several times, to get your possessions out. Be sure to leave your workspace clean for the next occupant., If another employee will be trained to fill your role when you leave, be ready to assist in transitioning that person into your role. This may include giving advice, training them, or transferring over relevant documents. Leave any in-process projects and related document well-organized so that your successor can easily pick up where you left off., Continue to fulfill your objectives as normal, or even work harder, up until the last minute of your last day at your current job. This shows your employer that you are still a dedicated employee. After all, who knows when you might need a reference for a future position? Show your current employer that you are a hard worker to earn their respect and a glowing reference if you ever need one., During your exit interview, pay attention to the information presented to you. In many instances, the employee in charge of your exit information will give you specific information on the company's rules regarding information you can give potential employers about your work. Note any confidentiality agreements or limitations on referral letters, recommendations, or other interactions with potential employers.",1513,"['time', 'contract', 'last day', 'resignation letter', 'person', 'health coverage needs', 'exit interview', 'next move', 'weeks notice', 'transferrable benefits', 'replacement', 'final look', 'direct channels', 'communication', 'company-owned electronic devices', 'personal possessions', 'story', 'office', 'financial security']"

Look for these forms on the court's website, or contact the clerk of the court where your case has been assigned.If your court does not have blank motion forms, don't use a blank form from another state. Instead draft your own motion.; , Since this is a motion, you should have prior documents in your possession to use as a guide. Look at one of the documents. The heading information is called the caption. Typically, the caption includes the name of the court, the name of the parties, and the case number.   This information should always remain in the same form in all documents filed in your case, both in content and format. Simply copy the caption from a previous document into your motion.  , Your title should tell the court what the motion is about. If you are asking the court for a default judgment, then your title should be ""Motion for Default Judgment.""   The title should be two lines below the caption, in bold face, centered in the middle of the page. Use a prior document as a guide.  , In the body, you should begin by identifying yourself as either the Plaintiff or the Defendant, and then state whether you are represented by an attorney or making the motion pro se.   For example, you could write: ""Comes now Plaintiff, Jane Smith, in the above titled action, represented pro per, and moves that the Court…”  , Every motion is a request for judicial intervention. You want the court to do something. Now, after having laid out your introduction and facts, state what you want the court to do.   You should use language like the following: “Now comes Plaintiff, Jane Smith, represented pro per, in the above captioned action, and moves this Court for an order compelling Defendant, Michael Smith, to serve on her a response to Plaintiff’s First Request for Document Production…”  , After the introduction, state the facts of the case that are relevant to your motion. For example, if the defendant has a copy of a contract in his possession and you want to compel its disclosure, then state, ""According to information and belief, the Defendant has in his possession or control a contract executed April 15, 2009 between Plaintiff and Defendant.""   It may be easier to write out on a piece of paper what you want the court to do. For example, you may want it to postpone a trial because you have surgery scheduled. Or you may want the court to sanction the Plaintiff for not turning over documents requested. After you have done this, you can go back and identify the key facts that are relevant to your argument.  , The legal argument will differ depending on the motion you file. To make a legal argument, you need to state the legal rule and then explain how the facts you just listed apply to the legal rule.   For example, to file a motion for summary judgment, you need to state the summary judgment standard first: ""A party is entitled to summary judgment if 'there is no genuine issue as to a material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c)."" Then, list what facts the party has to prove: “The Plaintiff’s claim of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. sections 2000e et seq., requires that Plaintiff establish, by a preponderance of evidence, an initial showing that: (i) she is female, (ii) she was qualified for the position she held; (iii) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (iv) the adverse action occurred in circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.”Here, you have listed the source of the law (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. sections 2000e) and the facts the law requires the plaintiff to prove (the four elements, listed i-iv). Then, argue how the facts uncovered during discovery support your position. Here, because the Defendant is arguing the motion, he will argue that the facts show that the Plaintiff cannot prove at least one of the four factors listed. For example, “The Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a triable issue of fact as to whether she suffered an adverse employment action. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that she was called a 'thief' during a disciplinary hearing. However, an isolated incident of this nature cannot qualify as an ‘adverse employment action.’ because she was never actually disciplined based on that action.”, Begin a new paragraph after the body. Include the statement, ""I swear the information contained above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief."" Include a few blank lines for your signature. Then type your name, address, telephone number, and email address so the court or the other party can contact you.   Also insert a notary block. Many states require motions filed by pro se litigants to be signed in front of a notary public. Search the internet for a notary block acceptable for your state, and copy it below your signature block. An acceptable notary certification block might look like this: “I, ______, a Notary Public for the for do hereby certify that __________ personally appeared before me this day and acknowledged the due execution of the foregoing instrument. Witness my hand and official seal, this the __ day of ___ 20___.”Then include a line for the Notary’s signature and a line for the date the Notary’s commission expires.  , You must always notify the other party of any motion that you file, and you must certify that you have served them with a copy of the motion. Two lines beneath the notary block, center the words ""Certificate of Service"" in bold.   Many states have a preferred method. Search your state's form list for a certificate of service and insert the language into your motion. If you can't find a certificate of service specific to your state, then include the following: ""I swear that I have a true and correct copy of this document to all persons listed below on "", Some states also have a separate form that they use for this. If you can't find it on your court's website, then insert ""Notice of Hearing"" about two lines below the Certificate of Service, in the center of the page.   Then add: ""This motion is set to be heard by ____________ on the ____ day of ____, 20__ in Room ___ of ""  , If the motion must be notarized, then sign in front of a notary public. Many banks provide notary services free for their customers. You can also find paid notaries at various businesses, such as check cashing companies. Many courthouses also have notary services for a fee.   Bring acceptable forms of identification, such as driver's license or a passport.  , If you have any attachments to put with the motion, put those attachments behind your motion. Make a copy of the entire packet for your records and a copy for each defendant.   It is best to keep at least 2 copies for yourself in case the court loses a copy. Then you can give the court a copy while still retaining one for your records.  , Take the original motion with all attachments to the clerk of the court that is hearing your case and give it to him. This is the filing.   You should take your copies with you and have them time-stamped as well. By sending a time-stamped copy to the other parties, you signal to them that you have already filed the motion.  , While at the clerk's office, ask for a hearing date. If your court has a special method of scheduling motions, then the clerk will let you know. Once your hearing is scheduled, fill in the blanks on the original and all copies of the Notice of Hearing.  , Provide a copy of the motion to each defendant in the same manner that you said you were providing it in the Certificate of Service. Be sure to do this no later than 24 hours after filing your motion.   Service by sheriff or by a private process server costs a fee. At the courthouse, you can ask how much service by the sheriff will cost. Private service of process can cost between $20-100.

Read the company website and press releases, and use Google to find news articles. Prepare answers to predictable questions, such as the introductory 'Tell me about yourself', and questions about your abilities, career history, personality and goals. These should not be stumbling blocks; rehearse well beforehand.; , This will help you counter all the possible questions that will be hurled at you during the interview. Usually for the graduates who have come out of their college, the questions will be based on the learning in college and also related to the course. Dwelling too much into the subjects before attending the interview will cause last minute jitters. So it is better to know stuff beforehand.   Use the college's own verbiage that sold the degree courses to you in the first place as ready-made answers when your employer asks what use your learning is to your employer. Many colleges now tell you what useful skills you'll have to take out into the work world after learning. All you need do is memorize those alluring lines.  , It is advisable to be mentally prepared to attend the interview. Being mentally prepared will give you the leverage to think quickly and astutely. Not only does this involved the information finding mission from the prior step but it is also thinking through why you want to work for this organization, being ready for awkward or difficult questions and having a good idea about your fit in the place.   Think about your own resume. Anything odd about it, like chunks of missing time, an abrupt job end or a failure to launch? Address these in your mind so that you have good answers if the issue is raised. Have answers to awkward questions about plans for your future. While it is illegal in many jurisdictions to ask questions about your birthing intentions and family arrangements, employers find ways of wheedling this out of you with clever but sneaky questions. Be alert and have pulp answers to reassure their probing. Do some sleuthing about the corporate culture before arriving, so that you have a good idea of how conservative, liberal, dull, exciting or quirky the place is. Do your best to fit in, especially if it's not really your thing but you need the income badly.  , Write out a ton of questions and have your mom, your fiancé, your grandpa, your best friend or your dog ask you the questions. Practice them over and over until you feel confident with them and have good answers prepared. You don't have long to impress but you can prepare yourself to give pithy, clever and spot-on answers. Nothing should be a surprise, not even left-field questions, provided you've done the research ahead of time and have sought to cover every possibility.  , People make first impressions not only by what you say, but by what you wear. It is often said that interviewers gauge their candidates very early and hence dressing up will help in your cause. Make sure you look exceptionally nice. Pressed pants, (not jeans!) and a nice shirt will make your interviewer realize that you take this seriously.   Loud and obnoxious hair colors are not considered ""professional"". Unless you already know the person interviewing you, don't get judged by your hair dye choices. While all your friends may adore your bright blue hair streak, it's not appreciated in most work areas. Pop a wig on, if needs must. Dressing aptly reflect that you are interested in taking up the job.  , Have it ready in a neat, small folder. Have it all in order.  , Plan in advance so that you reach the destination on time.  , Don't be so early that the interviewer keeps eyeing you each time he or she looks for the next candidate––that says ""I don't have anything better to do"". And just don't be late, ever. That says ""Couldn't be bothered, not really keen"". Be about ten to five minutes early, even if this means hiding outside or in the foyer first.   If transport is iffy, go in early and sit in a cafe or public library. Spend the time revising and self-composing.  , When you first meet the interviewer, shake his or her hand firmly. A firm handshake is highly impressive and always leaves a lasting impression.   A firm handshake with the interviewer will indicate confidence and will create a good first impression.  , Good posture is a sign of composure and poise. A proper posture indicates confidence. Be loud and clear with your points and make yourself heard and understood whenever you speak. Eye contact should be dominant, as it portrays that you are aware of your audience.   Talk with a smile; it, along with good posture, are natural indicators of enthusiasm. Don't do the superman or supergirl laser stare and fail to look away. That indicates an inability to know where boundaries begin and end, the sign of a scary employee who will either be needy or way too bossy.  , Those are filler words, and they basically tell the interviewer straight up that you're nervous.  , If it is a casual interview, throw the interviewer a compliment. Whether it be a simple ""cute shirt"", or ""this place is so clean!"", it will still be flattering. Really, who doesn't love a good compliment?  , If you have done any previous work or courses in that field, let them know. It shows that you have experience, and that's always good.  , Show that you know what you are talking about. Deliver because you are competent and capable. At the same time, accept if you don't know something and say ""but I'm a fast learner and I'll get that down in a week with a little training"". Be a ray of positive vibes about your utility to the place of employment.  , When you're leaving the interview, remind the interviewer once again to keep you in mind. Flash a smile and walk out with confidence, and you are sure to be remembered.  , Cameras and microphones are everywhere these days, as are other employees. Punching the air and yelling ""I aced that"", or frowning and saying ""What a dinosaur that interviewer was!"" will be noticed by someone somewhere, so refrain from these actions until well out of sight of the building. Decorum and professionalism come first; nobody should try to ""be yourself"" in an interview situation.

Note that the bowl needs to be wide enough to fit the bottom of the saucepan you'll be using. You can also use this ice water in case you accidentally burn yourself during the cooking process. If you burn yourself with the metal saucepan or the hot syrup, simply dunk the burned area into the bowl of ice water to immediately stop the damage.; , Place the isomalt crystals in a small to medium saucepan. Pour the water into the saucepan, as well, and stir the two ingredients together with a metal spoon to combine.   You only need enough water to wet the isomalt. When combined at this stage, the contents of the saucepan should look like wet sand. If you need to alter the amount of isomalt, make sure that you change the amount of water, too. Typically, you need three to four parts isomalt for every one part water.Use distilled or filtered water. Tap water contains minerals that can cause the syrup to turn yellow or brown. The saucepan and spoon should be made of stainless steel. Avoid using a wooden spoon since previously absorbed material can seep into the syrup and give it a yellow tint., Set the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. The contents should reach a steady boil; do not stir or disturb them until they do.   Once the contents reach a boil, use a nylon pastry brush to scrape excess off the sides of the pan and back into the main mixture. Do not use a natural bristle brush for this. After cleaning the side of the saucepan, attach a candy thermometer to the side. Make sure that the ball of the thermometer touches the hot syrup, not the bottom of the pan.  , If you want to add food coloring to the isomalt syrup, this is the ideal temperature to do so. Add the number of drops needed to achieve your desired color depth, then stir the food coloring into the boiling syrup using a metal mixing spoon or skewer.   Don't worry if the mixture gets stuck at around 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius) for a little while. At this temperature, the excess water is boiling out. The temperature will not climb further until this water boils out. Expect the mixture to bubble rapidly when you add the food coloring in.  , In order to create isomalt glass or similar isomalt decorations, the liquified syrup must be allowed to reach this temperature. If it does not, the structure of the isomalt may not be altered enough to allow the decoration to set properly.   You should actually remove the saucepan from the heat when the thermometer reads 333 degrees Fahrenheit (167 degrees Celsius). The temperature will continue to climb after that, even if you try to quickly stop the melting process.  , Once the isomalt reaches the correct temperature, quickly transfer the saucepan to your prepared dish of ice water. Stick the bottom of the pan inside the water for 5 to 10 seconds or so to stop the temperature from climbing further.   Do not let any of the ice water get inside the saucepan. Remove the saucepan from the water as soon as the hissing sounds stop.  , Isomalt pours best at about 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius), so you should keep it warm in the oven until you are ready to use it to prevent the syrup from cooling too much.   The oven should be set to 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius). Keeping the isomalt syrup in the oven for 15 minutes will usually help it achieve its ideal pouring temperature. During this time, the bubbles will also have time to escape from the syrup. You can keep isomalt in the oven for up to three hours. If you store it longer, the mixture can begin to yellow.  , Make sure that they are evenly spread out to promote even melting.   If using isomalt sticks instead of nibs, break the sticks in halves or thirds before placing them in the dish. Isomalt nibs and sticks come in clear forms and pre-colored forms. If you want to create a colored creation, use pre-colored nibs. Since melted isomalt can get very hot, using a dish with a handle may make it easier and safer to handle the melted syrup. You could also use silicone baking dishes or bowls since silicone is fairly heat resistant. If you use something without a handle, however, consider placing the dish on a microwave-safe plate to limit the amount of contact you'll need to have with the dish itself.  , Continue microwaving them in this manner until the entire batch has been melted down.   Note that air bubbles will naturally form as the isomalt melts. Use oven mitts to protect your hands while handling a dish of hot isomalt. Stir the melting isomalt with a metal skewer or similar utensil. Avoid wooden utensils. It takes an average of one minute to melt roughly five nibs. This amount of time can vary depending on the strength of your microwave and the size of the nibs, however.  , Stir the melted isomalt one last time to remove as many air bubbles as possible.   You must make sure that all of the bubbles are out of the melted isomalt before you try to use it. If there are bubbles in the syrup, there will be bubbles in the finished decoration.  , If the isomalt begins to harden or set before you have a chance to use it, you can simply reheat it in the microwave by putting the dish in and reheating it in additional intervals of 15 to 20 seconds.   You should be able to let the melted isomalt sit out for up to 5 or 10 minutes before it starts cooling. If additional bubbles begin to form, stir the isomalt to help release them.  , Spray an even layer of nonstick cooking spray into each mold, giving each one a thorough, even coat.Use a dry paper towel to clean off excess cooking spray from the top of the molds. Make sure that the molds you use are labeled for use with isomalt or sugar-based hard candy. The high temperatures you'll be working with could melt molds that are not durable enough.  ,   Adding more could cause the bag to weaken or melt. Adding too much can also cause burns. Using pastry may can make it easier for you to work with the melted isomalt, but many find the step to be an unnecessary one. Do not cut off the tip of the pastry bag before adding the isomalt. Leave the tip intact for now. Make sure that you still continue to wear oven mitts while handling the pastry bag. The heat of the melted isomalt can still burn you through the bag.  , Place just enough melted isomalt into each mold compartment to fill it.   Only cut the tip of the pastry bag when you are ready to fill the molds. The isomalt will pour out quickly, so you'll need to be careful. Regardless of how you pour the melted isomalt, you should let it pour out in a thin stream. Doing so will minimize the number of bubbles that form. Lightly tap the bottom of the mold on a counter, table, or other hard surface to release any bubbles from the syrup after you fill the molds.  , Depending on the size of your molds, the isomalt should harden into a stiff decoration within 5 to 15 minutes.   Once the isomalt cools, it should naturally pull away from the sides of the mold. You should be able to simply tip the mold on its side and watch the pieces tumble out.  , The isomalt decorations can be stored in airtight containers or used immediately.   If you plan on sticking the decorations to something like a cake, apply a little corn syrup or melted isomalt to the back of the decoration using a toothpick, then stick the decoration onto the cake. It should remain in place without any difficulty.

Contouring is a makeup application technique that plays with the natural shadows of your face. Depending on how you apply contours, certain areas of your face can look smaller or larger. By applying contours using the steps listed here, you can make your nose appear smaller.; , If you do not already have a regular foundation, pick one that matches your natural skin tone as closely as possibly. Apply that all over your face, including your nose.         , Pick a foundation one or two shades darker than your natural shade. Apply this foundation to the sides of your nose, blending well.          If you have a long nose as well as a large one, you should also apply this foundation to the tip of your nose. The most important part of the entire contouring process is the blending process. Use a makeup brush or sponge to thoroughly blend this darker shade into the natural foundation beneath. When finished, this dark foundation should look like a natural shadow instead of looking like makeup.  , Pick out a third foundation one shade lighter than your natural tone. Apply this foundation to the top bridge of your nose, starting in between your eyes and ending just before the tip and nostrils.          This foundation highlights the center line of your nose, making the ""shadows"" you created with your dark foundation more effective. As before, you need to blend this foundation into both your natural and dark shades as thoroughly as possible. The transition between shades should be seamless and must appear natural.  , Select a loose matte powder and dust it all over the sides of your nose.          This loose powder can help mask any lines or imperfections in your foundation, allowing your makeup to seem more natural. Make sure that you use a matte powder. Shimmer powders draw more attention to anything they touch, so if you apply a shimmer powder to your nose, you will only accentuate it further.  , One of the best ways to hide your nose is to make another facial feature stand out more. Wearing bold eye makeup or daring lip color will cause onlookers to notice your eyes or lips more than any other part of your face, including your nose.   If you choose to accentuate your eyes, make them pop by applying dark eyeliner and mascara. Bright or bold eye shadows are also great to wear for evening looks but should still be avoided for daytime wear. If you choose to accentuate your lips, use bright or bold lipstick colors. Lip color with a little shine or sparkle can also work great. Only accentuate one feature at a time. Applying heavy makeup on both your eyes and lips can easily overwhelm your face.  , In addition to accentuating your lips or eyes, you can balance out your nose by making your cheekbones more prominent.Choose a blush one or two shades darker than your natural skin tone and apply it to the apples of your cheeks. Shimmer blushes can actually work well here since they highlight skin more than matte blushes do. Similarly, you can also apply a light bronzer along the cheekbones to make them glow and stand out more.  , In particular, you need to keep shine off your nose. Shine catches the eye and draws more attention to a feature, so shine on your nose will make your nose look even larger.   The most important thing to do is to keep as much oil off your nose as possible. Use a gentle facial cleanser on your nose each morning and evening. Harsh cleansers can actually irritate the skin and cause it to produce more oil. Throughout the day, dab off some of the excess oil that gathers on your nose with tissue or cosmetic oil blotting paper. When applying any makeup to your nose, use a matte formula instead of a shimmery formula.  , Medium and long hairstyles are typically better than short cuts. Short hairstyles frame the face and highlight the nose, which can make it look even larger. Medium and long cuts balance out your facial features, making them appear smaller., Straight, blunt styles create more straight vertical lines and emphasize the largest straight line on your face—your nose. Put layers in your hair, instead, to create a softer and more rounded look.   While all layer styles are better than blunt styles, feathery layers are the best of the best. This texture is especially soft and wavy, so it provides the greatest amount of balance against the straight line of your nose.  , In general, adding waves and curves to your hair will break up and balance out any harsh lines on your face. The bridge of your nose is the longest, most visible straight line on your face.   Use a diffuser, hair rollers, or a curling iron to add a wavy texture to your hair.  , Sleek, tight ponytails can make your facial features appear sharper and more severe. As a result, the angles and size of your nose will stand out more.   When you tie your hair back in a ponytail or sweep it into an up-do, choose a somewhat messy style. Create body at the crown and allow a few stray strands to swoop down, framing your face in a subtle curve.  ,   In contrast, a side part offsets the lines of your face, breaking them up and making your nose stand out less.  , Bangs can help hide a large nose, but you should generally avoid bangs that hand down at blunt, sharp angles. Straight lines will only draw more attention to the straight line of your nose.   When getting bangs, consider side swept bangs that break up the angles of your face or wispy bangs that that soften the lines of your face.  ,   The idea here is to balance out your facial features with one another. When hair covers your forehead or the sides of your face, these features get lost while your nose remains very visible. As a result, your nose appears to take up more space on your face. Keeping hair off your face can prevent this from happening. For this reason, men who want to hide a big nose should avoid mustaches and beards. Covering too much skin on your face can actually make your nose stand out more.  , A wide bridge creates a stronger, more visible divide.   Larger frames are generally a better option than smaller ones. The large frames can compete with the size of your nose and help balance it out, but smaller frames can draw more attention to the size of your nose. The other option is to go for contacts. Since glasses sit at the top of your nose, they do draw some attention to that area of your face. Getting contacts avoids this issue completely.  , Short, dainty earrings can draw attention to this horizontal space, which could also draw attention to your nose. Larger earrings that extend below the ear enlarge the sides of this horizontal space, making the nose at the center of this space appear smaller by comparison.   If you do not want to wear long earrings, at least choose short earrings that cover the earlobes completely. This will draw more attention to the sides of this horizontal space, which can help draw attention off your nose. Rounded earrings that occupy both horizontal and vertical space are better than earrings that only add a vertical dimension. Earrings that emphasize straight, vertical lines will also emphasize the straight, vertical line of the nose.  , Both men and women should look for hat styles that have a rounded or down-turned brim at the front of the face. A brim that hangs down over the front of the face can visually build out the forehead. As a result, the nose appears shorter and more proportionate.Avoid ""tricorne"" styles, which meet at a point above the forehead. Hats that have a larger brim in the front than in the back may build out the forehead better than those with an even brim all around. Make sure that the crown does not pinch in too tightly toward the front of the face. Ideally, this crown should also be of medium height to maintain better visual balance, and it should not taper in much toward the top. Consider choosing a hat with a wide, colorful band above the brim. This band can draw the eye up and away from the nose.",1419,"['long vertical line', 'toner.begin', 'attention', 'horizontal space', 'light toner', 'complexion glow', 'eye', 'lips', 'portion', 'color', 'glasses', 'straight line', 'low bridge.the', 'bridge', 'regular foundation', 'side', 'sides', 'draw subtle attention', 'skin', 'waves', 'clean skin', 'way', 'particular feature', 'bottom portion', 'cheekbones', 'curls', 'prominent brim', 'swipe translucent powder', 'side.a center part', 'contouring process', 'hair', 'large earrings.your ears', 'foundation', 'nose', 'look', 'face', 'face shape', 'neat ponytails', 'things', 'shine', 'cut layers', 'eyes', 'hat']"

Were you happy to see the cat? Did the cat fill you with fear? Consider why this feeling might have come up for you.To better understand your feeling about the cat in your dream, think about other dream elements you might remember. For example, if you remember drowning, then being rescued by a cat, you might be filled with surprise and gratitude. This might mean that help comes from unexpected places or people. Was the cat familiar to you, in the dream? Whether or not you recognize the cat from your waking life, you may experience a sense of familiarity to the cat in your dream. Perhaps the cat is a symbol of safety. If the cat was causing you to feel afraid, perhaps there is something in your life that's causing you fear or worry. For example, if the cat was attacking you, this might suggest that you're feeling attacked by some circumstance of your life.; , Think about the location of the cat in your dream. Was the cat outside, like a feral cat, or inside, like a domestic pet? What other elements surrounded the cat? For example, a cat outside on a moonlit night might also include the dream symbols of a full moon, a dark house, a rustle of dry leaves underfoot, an owl, a cold breeze, etc.Dreams are emotional, not rational. Perhaps your cat was swimming underwater, quite happily (and unrealistically!) Don't worry if your dream doesn't make sense. As you write about every element, think about how you feel about it. The dream came from your subconscious, and you are the best interpreter of what your dream means.  , Because dreams are created from your subconscious mind, they are deeply personal to your nature and experience. A cat in your dream will not be the same as a cat in anyone else's dream. Many people believe that a cat in dream is a personal symbol, unique to you.Consider what cats mean to you, specifically. Are you allergic to cats? Did you have a cat in your childhood? If there is any unique meaning that you connect to cats, it's likely that this meaning will be part of your dream interpretation. Remember that the goal of dream interpretation is to better understand yourself. Dreams are unlikely to be functional predictors of the future, to provide lucky lottery numbers, or to give you the answer to an algebra problem.  , Some dream interpreters feel that aspects of the dreamer are found within every element of the dream. The cat in the dream may symbolize you, or parts of you. Think about what characteristics you and the cat might share in common.Did the cat in your dream appear unique in any way? Did the circumstances in which the cat appeared feel familiar? Or was the situation novel or unlikely? Dreaming makes the connection between the dreamer's conscious and unconscious mind. Feelings, thoughts, and ideas found in the dreamer's unconscious mind can surface through dream imagery and symbols.  , Cats are ancient dream images, symbolizing intuition, femininity, softness, an independent spirit, creativity, power, misfortune, vulnerability, bad luck, and deceitfulness. Whatever you can recall about the cat within your dream will also help you understand its meaning.   If the cat in your dream was playful, perhaps you may desire to be a little more light-hearted in your life. If your dream cat was aggressive, perhaps you're experiencing some difficulty with the more feminine side of your nature. If you've lost your cat in your dreams, it might be a sign that you're not as independent as you'd like to be. The health of the cat in your dreams is also a clue to its meaning. For example, if the cat in your dreams is sickly, this might mean that you're not paying enough attention to your intuition. By being overly rational, you've allowed the intuitive part of your nature become weak.  , Dreaming about a wild, or feral, cat may mean that a neighbor could be dangerous to you (or that this is something that you fear). A cat who bites you in your dream might mean the loss of something important to you.While cats are generally a symbol of independence, a dream about a kitten often reflects vulnerability and the need to be taken care of. Dream images can be simple, or they can be complex. When you're interpreting what the cat in your dream might mean, allow yourself to be open to a wide range of possible interpretations.  , Despite the black cat being a common symbol of bad luck, seeing a black cat in your dreams doesn't have any particular bad luck attached. More important to the interpretation of your dream are the way you feel about the cat, how you treat it, and how it treats you.In the past, any cat appearing in a dream was generally considered to be bad luck. This has changed, however, as cultures became more comfortable with mystical topics. Cats often represent sexuality and women. When a woman dreams about a cat, she may be dreaming about her own sexual power. A man dreaming about a cat may be symbolizing sexual fulfillment, or his own intuitive nature.  , If the cat in your dreams carries a meaning for you, it doesn't matter what any dream dictionary says. As you can see, dream dictionaries carry a wide range of possible interpretation. As you become more skilled at remembering your dreams, and thinking deeply about each element within the dream, you will learn to interpret what your dreams mean for you.Notice if you see a pattern in your dreams. Do certain elements recur on a regular basis? Do you notice that you often dream about a certain cat, or different cats? Your observations on your dreams should include who, what, when, where and why. Always ask yourself: how did I feel about this?   , Most dream experts recommend to keep a dream journal. A dream journal is a notebook kept beside your bed with a pen or pencil nearby. As soon as you wake up, immediately reach for pen and paper to write down everything you remember about your most recent dream.   Try to write down any dream you have, no matter how difficult it may be to remember clearly. Include as many details as you can, no matter how strange or random. List colors, location, characters, sounds, emotions and objects. Each element has a possible meaning. Don't worry about grammar or spelling. No one else is likely to read this - it's just for you. If using an app on your phone or tablet is easier for you, consider keeping your dream journal here. The main thing is to have it very close to your bed, so that it's there as you wake up.  , The feelings that you experience in your dreams are not symbolic, but real feelings. Most people suppress negative emotions during the day, but these emotions will appear in dreams. Learn to notice your feelings about every element within your dream in order to better interpret its meaning.Feelings expressed in dreams can help you better deal with depression, guilt, and other difficult emotions in your waking life. The most common emotions found in dreams are fear and anxiety, followed by anger and sadness.  , Over time you may start to notice similar themes and patterns emerging from otherwise dissimilar dreams. For example, if you keep finding yourself dreaming about stressful situations, even though the elements might be very different, it's important to look at the ways this stressful situation might be manifesting itself in your life.There are apps, such as Dream Professor, that provide instant analysis of your dream elements. These apps focus on the pattern of images and words in a dream, rather than trying to read the plot or recognize individual symbols.  , When you've written down your dream, go back to sleep. Later, when you're fully awake, revisit your dream journal and read through your notes for meaning. Each dream is a mine of metaphorical meaning that you can interpret in multiple ways.Many experts suggest that the dreamer avoid thinking of a dream in literal terms. For example, a dream about skydiving doesn't usually mean that the person is likely to jump out of a plan. Sometimes an element of a dream is not a metaphor, but simply a way that the person processes information. For example, people who spent most of their lives before color television also dream in black and white.  , Some analytical therapists incorporate dream analysis into their therapy practice. If this appeals to you, consider learning more about dream interpretation, or finding a therapist who uses this approach.There are many dream dictionaries available online or in bookstores. These are interesting and entertaining, but genuine dream analysis is more subtle and complex than these books may suggest. Dream interpretation was a standard part of psychoanalytic models of both Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Jung's understanding of archetypes found in dreams shaped generations of scholars and psychologists.

If on the other hand you are moving from one urban neighborhood to another, look for moving companies that cater to people who live in your city.; , One good way to begin your search is through word of mouth recommendations from friends, family, and coworkers. While researching these companies is still an important step, having a rough idea of which are competent and which should be avoided can save you a lot of time.  , Call one or two local real estate agents and ask if they can recommend a moving company. They have likely assisted many of their customers moving in or out of your current area.   If you have at least three recommended companies at this point, you can skip to Researching a Moving Company. Return here for more ideas if those companies aren't satisfactory.  , Use a copy of the local phone book or yellow pages to search under ""Moving"" for possible companies to investigate. The companies listed should have actual addresses in your area, and are much less likely to scam you than the companies you find on an internet search.If there are too many companies to research, narrow it down to companies that have been in business for at least ten years. Many listings will have a ""founded,"" ""est.,"" or ""since"" date that will tell you when the company was created.  , If you don't have at least three companies to research, or if the companies you found by other methods turned out not to suit your needs, it's time to search online. Search for ""moving company"" plus the name of your city or area, but be cautious to avoid online scams. Every company website should display an address in your area, and you should never enter personal information or pay a fee to access the site. Research companies found online with special care, as described in the next section.   Avoid sites that claim to find a mover for you. These are usually scams trying to take your money or personal information., You may be tempted to hire a ""moving broker"" that claims to arrange a good deal for you. Unfortunately, at least in the United States and the United Kingdom, moving brokers are not subject to the same consumer protection laws that prevent ordinary moving companies from scamming or mistreating their customers.It's best to avoid moving brokers entirely and stick with hiring a company yourself.  , Look up the company's name on sites such as movingscam.com or Yelp. You might find a recommendation, a rating, or a warning that the company engages in scams or bad service. Try to search on several well-known websites to get more information. If it sounds like the company may have scammed people in the past, cross it off your list.   You may not wish to trust the Better Business Bureau, which has been accused of raising ratings in exchange for money., The company website is usually listed in the phone directory, or easily found through an online search. If the website looks amateur, is difficult to navigate, or doesn't contain the information you need, you might want to look for a more professional company. At a minimum, the website should clearly tell you:   The company's full name. If this is different than you expected, or if there are multiple names listed, search for additional reviews to make sure it is a real company. The address of the company. Never hire a company with no address. A large company with multiple locations may have an address look-up to find offices near you. Contact information, including a phone number and email address.  , Ask for at least three references from the company, making it clear that you are asking for past customers. Call each of these references and ask for details of their moving experience. If a satisfied customer hired one truck to move a few blocks away, it might not tell you much if you are planning to move a thousand miles away.  , In the United States, companies that transport cargo across state lines, and some that work within a state, are required to have a USDOT Number and Motor Carrier license number.These may be displayed on their advertisements or website, or you may need to ask for them via email or phone. Use a motor carrier lookup site to see if the company is legitimate.   If the USDOT records say Out of Service, or if the contact information doesn't match what you are using to communicate with the company, you may be dealing with scam artists. The Motor Carrier records should include a safety rating. Look for a ""Satisfactory"" in the companies you hire.  , Have the moving company's employees been professional and polite during your communications? Have they responded promptly to your emails (the next business day or sooner), or have they been making you wait? If a company is too busy or too incompetent to communicate politely with a potential customer, you may not want to hire them.  , Once you're sure a company is legitimate, it's time to find out about pricing. Contact the company to request an on-site estimate, in which the company sends an employee to examine your belongings and estimate how much the move will cost. Ask for a ""binding"" estimate if possible, which will clearly list the cost of each service. A ""nonbinding"" estimate could become significantly more expensive when the company actually charges you.The exact laws governing binding and nonbinding estimates vary between states and countries, so look up laws in your area if you want to be sure what the estimate tells you.   Show the estimator everything he needs to make an accurate estimate. This includes closets, basement, the backyard and sheds, and anywhere else where movable goods are stored. If the estimator doesn't make a thorough examination, don't trust the estimate.  , Read the fine print carefully to work out how much the move will actually cost. Ask the company to disclose all fees, including fees for moving certain items, packing and unpacking each carton, or using additional packing material if a carton comes apart. If the fees seem unreasonable, move on to another company.   In the United States, each moving company is required to have a '""tariff"" which lists these fees in full., Ask the movers for information on valuation or liability, which will tell you how much the movers will owe you if items are damaged or lost during shipment.A moving company may offer several valuation services at different prices, and if you do not specifically sign a document agreeing to one service, they may try to charge you on a more expensive plan.Some valuation services are included at no extra cost. However, these may only provide you with a small percentage of the damaged item's value. For instance, the Released Value plan, required in the U.S., provides only 60¢ per pound of weight damaged, no matter how much the item was actually worth. More comprehensive plans may require the movers to replace, repair, or pay for damaged items in full. However, these typically cost more and may be limited to certain expensive items. Be sure to list every item you want covered on the valuation agreement., If one company gives much lower cost estimates than its competitors, don't jump on the opportunity without doing your research. This could mean an inaccurate or dishonest estimate, or lower quality service that could damage your household items. In the worst case scenario, it could be a scam that steals your possessions or holds them ransom for additional fees.

But did you know that smiling can actually boost your mood? Smiling can induce feelings of happiness just as happiness can cause a smile.Try smiling with your whole face, not just your lips. Feel your cheeks and eyes change when engaging a large smile. This kind of smile is associated with positive emotions.If you’re feeling upset or grumpy, combat those feelings with a smile. Try to connect with the sensations of smiling and begin to feel happiness.; , Getting through an uncomfortable situation while looking or feeling unfazed is a skill, and much can be attributed to confidence. If you have a presentation and feel fearful, tap into your innate confidence, even if public speaking is enough to make you run and hide. Tell yourself you can do it. Chances are, if you exude confidence (even if it’s forced or unnatural at first), people will believe you are competent.Speak loudly and clearly, and act as if you are fully confident in your abilities. The opposite is true, too. If you go into a presentation feeling fearful, lots of things can give away your fear, such as shaky voice, lack of eye contact, acting flustered, etc.  , If you’re closed off, looking down, or crossing your arms/legs, people may assume you are unapproachable. People with proper posture report higher levels of positive mood and self-esteem than slouchers.Changing your body language can help your mind believe that your are confident.   Practice puffing your shoulders out (as a way to appear/feel bigger) or putting your hands on your hips. Practice doing triumphant poses, such as pumping your first in the air before a nerve-racking situation., Relaxation can help calm any anxiety you may be feeling, and can help you feel more at ease. If you are feeling tense, restless, or unhappy, try some relaxation techniques to help you feel more balanced. This can be especially helpful before a big presentation or something that makes you feel anxious.Slow your breathing and start counting your breaths, 4 seconds inhale, then 4 seconds exhale. Once this feels easy, extend to 6 second intervals, observing your breath moving in and out of your body. Use muscle relaxation to soften tense muscles. You can do progressive muscle relaxation, which focuses on different parts of your body at a time, releasing any tension you feel. Start with your toes, then work on muscle groups through your legs, hips, stomach, chest, arms, shoulders, and neck., Some situations you have to get through and act natural, even if you feel unnatural. Think about how the way you look will affect your future. If you are meeting your long-term partner’s parents for the first time and are not feeling well, it’s a good opportunity to use some perspective and make a likeable impression. Yet, realize that not every situation is important to look or act your best. Recognize when you have the choice to leave a situation or whether you must go through with something due to circumstance.If you’ve just broken your leg, you don’t need to pretend to be happy. You are in pain! The same is true if you’ve experienced a difficult situation, like the loss of a sibling or grandparent. It’s okay to feel sad.  , Changing your attitude can be especially important before an unpleasant event. Take a moment and find new ways to re-think negative thoughts, and try to find some positive aspects to reflect upon. You may be stuck in a negative thought cycle and need an overhaul to help you feel more positively. Reflect on what kind of attitude you are bringing into a situation and whether it is in your best interest.Changing your attitude can help you feel happy long enough to get through a difficult situation.   If you have to go to an event you’re not looking forward to, adjust your attitude. Remember that these events don’t happen frequently, and you can get through it, even if you anticipate it being unpleasant. You may meet someone interesting, enjoy some good food, or be pleasantly surprised by what you learn. Acknowledge the potential positives that can come from the event, and give less precedence to the potential negatives. For more information check out How to Change a Negative Attitude.  , If you’re struggling to look or feel happy, chances are you may be experiencing negative thoughts. Self talk helps you to shift the focus from your negative or unhelpful thoughts onto calming yourself so you can feel more at ease.This can help you get through an unpleasant situation more easily and help you appear happier, even if you feel miserable. Some examples of self-talk:   ""I may not feel well, but I can still do a good job” ”This is an uncomfortable situation right now, but I know I can head home immediately afterwards to deal with it” ""I am here to enjoy myself""  , If you’re struggling to even pretend to be happy, find things to be grateful for in your life. Grateful people report higher levels of health and happiness, such as better sleep, increased empathy, and improved self-esteem.Find things to look forward to and be thankful for the small stuff: a roof over your head, a nice day, a good friend, anything! You may even begin to feel happier, not just act happier.   List 5 things that bring you joy or fulfillment in your life. It can be as simple as waking up to no dishes in the sink. Then, think of a situation that made you feel upset or frustrated, and describe it in writing. Afterwards, think of three things that help you appreciate the difficult situation. Perhaps you ran late for work because you had to fill up your gas tank, but got the opportunity to buy your favorite coffee. Or, your workplace is understanding about being late occasionally. Reflect whether or not you will remember this even in a week, or two, or five., Strengthen your friendships and work on your social skills. Don't isolate yourself in a time of need, reach out! Talk to people everyday, and get some human contact to make you feel better. Even if it takes some forcing, make yourself socialize with the people you care about, and remember that they care about you, too.Acting happy can be a lot easier when surrounded by friends.   If you tend to isolate, realize that this can lead to or contribute to feelings of depression. Social contact is an important part of life.Especially if you are struggling with a situation, make sure you have people you can lean on and talk to when you get the chance.  , If you find yourself always trying to look and act happy when you don’t feel happy, seek out professional help. There’s no use trying to look and act happy when you don’t feel a source of happiness within you.   If you feel chronically unhappy, you may suffer from depression.

"['identify different types of present tenses', 'identify different past tenses', 'identify future tenses', 'move the object to the beginning of the sentence', 'add an auxiliary verb “be” before the main verb', 'add the preposition “by” before the subject', 'maintain the sentence tense', 'remove emphasis from the subject', 'place the direct object in a place of importance', 'writing a scientific or technical paper in passive voice']",How to Change a Sentence from Active Voice to Passive Voice," The present tense describes action being done in the present moment—not future, not past, and not a hypothetical action. The English language has a simple present tense, a present continuous tense, a present perfect tense, and present perfect continuous tense.All indicate action in the present, but differ in their descriptions of how long the action has been taking place.   Simple present tense combines a subject + verb. For example: “He writes.” Present continues tense combines a subject + being verb (am, is , are) + verb1 + ing. For Example: “He is writing.” Present perfect tense combines a subject + have/has + verb. For example: “He has written.” Present perfect continuous tense combines subject + has/have + been + verb + ing. Example: “He has been writing.”; , Just as English has multiple present tenses, the language also possesses multiple past tenses. English has a simple past tense, as well as past perfect, past conditional, and past perfect conditional tenses.All past-tense sentences describe something that has already occurred.   Simple past tense combines a subject + verb in the sentence. For example: “He wrote.” Past perfect tense combines the subject + had + verb. For example: “He had written.” Past continuous tense combines a subject + being verb (was, were) + verb + ing. For example: “He was writing.” Past perfect continuous tense combines subject + had + been + verb + ing. For example: “He had been writing.”  , Like present and past tenses, English has multiple forms of the future tense. Each version indicates an action that has not yet occurred—but will occur in the future—and the distinctions between different types of future tense signify the completion or incompletion of the future act.Simple future tense combines a subject + “will” + verb. For example, “He will write.” Future perfect tense combines the subject + “will have” + verb. For example, “He will have written.” Future continuous tense combines a subject + “will” + being verb + verb. For example, “He will be writing.” Future perfect continuous tense combines the subject + “have been” + verb + “ing.” For example, “He will have been writing.”  , Sentences in the active voice typically begin with the subject and describe the action it does to the direct object. To achieve the passive voice, switch this placement by moving the direct object to the beginning of the sentence.This will highlight the object and its reception of the verb.   For example, the sentence “He will write a letter” is in the future tense and active voice. To change this to passive voice, move the direct object to the beginning of the sentence, while keeping the future tense: “A letter will be written by him.”  , Adding a “be” verb will make the active verb passive, and highlight the way the direct object was acted upon, rather than how the subject performed that action (as in an active-voice sentence).Depending on the tense of the sentence, being verbs include: “is,” “was,” “will be,” “has been,” etc.  , The subject (preceded by “by”) should come at the end of the passive-voice sentence.By stating “by” late in the sentence, you’ll add the subject after the direct object and verb have already been clarified.For example: “The stretch of highway was paved by the construction crew.”In cases where the subject (one who does the action) is unknown, you may not be able to add the word “by.” For example, if you have received a letter but do not know who sent it, you would write, “The letter was sent to me on November 1st,” but you would not say by whom it was sent.  , While switching from active to passive voice, be sure to maintain the correct tense from the original sentence.Keep any auxiliary verbs: verbs which modify the tense of the main verb. Auxiliary verbs include “be,” “can,” “do” and “have.” Read the passive-voice sentence over to yourself to make sure it has the same tense as the former active-voice sentence. For example:   Active voice, present tense: The cat kills the mice. Passive voice, present tense: The mice are killed by the cat. Active voice, past continuous tense: Some boys were helping the wounded men. Passive voice, past continuous tense: Wounded men were being helped by some boys. Active voice, future perfect tense: Someone will have stolen my purse. Active voice, future perfect tense: My purse will have been stolen by someone.  , While the passive voice is discouraged in some instances because it can be a sign of weak writing, there are plenty of situations where it’s appropriate. The active voice firmly places the subject—the one who does the action—at the beginning of the clause, passive voice can obscure the subject, focusing instead on the direct object receiving the action.Be careful when removing emphasis from the subject of a sentence, as in some cases it can be seen as confusing to the reader. Passive voice can also remove the subject of a sentence altogether. For example, a politician who says, “I have lied to the American people” may be seen as repentant and forthcoming. If the individual were to say “The American people have been lied to,” they politician would be removing any blame from themselves by phrasing the sentence in the passive voice and removing the subject.  , If the subject of your sentence is relatively unimportant, while the direct object and the action done to it are significant, the passive voice can be used. Writers often use the passive voice when describing an event or occurrence in which the direct object or action is more relevant than the subject of the sentence.For example, the sentence “American nuclear devices were first tested in July 1945” places the emphasis on the nuclear testing and leaves the specific researchers anonymous.  , In science writing, the passive voice is used to indicate objectivity and detachment from the topic or investigation of the paper. Within a scientific paper, sections describing “Methods,” “Materials,” or “Processes” are nearly always written in passive voice.For example, instead of writing “My team placed seven stream gages in the river,” you would write, “Seven stream gages were placed in the river.” Here the passive voice lends anonymity to the action: anyone can replicate the experiment by repeating the same procedures. By using the passive voice, you’re arguing that the results can be replicated regardless of which scientists perform the actions.

This can blind you to new opportunities, though, since you might be too fixated on your own plans to look beyond them at something even better.Additionally, it's also easy to spend your life making plans instead of actually getting things done. If you tend to be an excessive planner, ease yourself out of your planning mode by tearing up your to-do list at least one day each week. Once you feel comfortable with one day, live spontaneously for two days each week. Continue in this manner until you've completely set aside the practice of planning everything beyond appointments and other scheduling essentials.; , There is no one set path toward the future. You can look to others for examples of how life might work out, but ultimately, you need to step off the trail before you and create your own.   Understanding how the world works doesn't hurt, of course. Time-tested wisdom has its place, and general advice you receive on making progress personally and professionally often helps. The key is applying this general wisdom while planning your own steps instead of trying to exactly mimic the steps of others.  , Even though you shouldn't plan things out step-by-step, you still need to have a destination in mind. Otherwise, your life will become directionless instead of simply being improvised.Stay true to your hopes, dreams, and other primary goals. Instead of letting those things go in response to the actions and feelings of others, cling to your own wants while adjusting the path you take to reach them in response to others.  , It isn't enough to talk about getting things done. You need to actually get moving, which means taking action as soon as the desire strikes you.   Do not wait for the perfect starting point. The longer you wait, the greater your expectations will be, and the more difficult it will be for you to actually take those first few steps. Say or do the first thing that comes to mind and work from there.  , Even though you should start moving immediately, you also need to fall into a pace that feels comfortable and right to you.Don't expect to find your dream job as soon as enter the workforce. Aside from being unrealistic, fixating on the ideal job you have in your thoughts shuts the door on other opportunities lying directly in front of you. This also means you'll need to quit looking around at your peers. It doesn't matter if the friends you had in school are financially more stable or settled into domestic tranquility. Their lives aren't yours and your life isn't theirs, so it stands to reason that your life will run at a separate pace.  , Put yourself into unfamiliar situations to build your confidence and open yourself to new possibilities. Start small, then work your way up to bigger and better adventures.   For instance, a small risk might be trying a new food or learning a new hobby. Once you become comfortable with small risks like these, you can move onto bigger ones, like traveling to a foreign country or investing money in a new business venture.  , You likely improvise in your daily life without even realizing it. Passive improvising will only help to a certain point, however. If you really want to get good at it, you need to intentionally improvise a little each day.   Throughout the day, look for opportunities to confront the unknown and the unexpected. Talk to a stranger. Engage in a conversation covering an unfamiliar topic. Take a different route on your way home from work. Simply changing one small aspect of your daily routine will force you to improvise in a small way, making it easier for you to grow comfortable with the practice of improvising in general.  , Life is chaotic, whether you're actively improvising your way through it or not. When you commit to improvising, though, you also commit to accepting the inevitable and unpredictable change life introduces to you.   It's okay to feel insecure at times, but once you grow to expect the unexpected, it should gradually seem less intimidating overall. As such, the insecurity you feel now may lessen later on.  , Failure is inevitable. If you live your life being afraid to fail, you won't move forward and you won't be able to make the most of each mistake you're confronted with.   Each mistake doubles as an opportunity, so think of failure as an essential part of growing stronger and smarter. When you fail, reflect on what happened and figure out how to avoid the same sort of difficulty in the future. As you let go of fear, you'll also become more confident and more skilled at adapting to the unexpected.  , Before you can react to something, you will need to have a good understanding of what you're reacting to. When considering someone's words and actions, though, you need to look at the deeper meaning as well as the surface meaning.Resist the temptation to multitask. The vast majority of people don't actually multitask well, so focusing on one task at a time will keep you more focused and improve your understanding. Maintain eye contact when talking with people to let them know that you're actively engaged in conversation. Eye contact also allows you to read nonverbal communication more effectively. Try to empathize with the people you're around in any situation. Put yourself in their shoes so that you can understand their needs and wants, and react accordingly.  , While it's true that grand gestures can leave lasting impressions, remembering and using the little details of everyday life can actually impress people more.   Little details, like the names of a coworker's children or beloved pet, are easy to miss when you're fixated on big plans. Most people tend to ignore them completely unless they really care about someone. By taking the time to acknowledge these details, you show others that you care about them and leave a more favorable impression with those people. Leaving good impressions with the people around you can help propel you forward and open up the door to new opportunities you couldn't find on your own.  , Your past and current experiences have informed you and shaped you into the person you are today. It can be easy to doubt yourself, especially in the midst of other experienced individuals, but you need to trust your intuition, thoughts, and feelings.   Public speaking is a good way to practice this principle. Instead of writing out exact notes the next time you need to make a speech, write questions that you need to address during that speech. As a result, it should be easier to weave details into the presentation as you go along, making the whole thing appear more natural.  , You don't have to accept every proposed solution, but you do need to accept every set of circumstances life throws at you.In other words, you need to remain positive. Instead of fixating on how unpleasant a given situation feels, acknowledge the situation and focus on making the most of it. Keep an open mind, too. Instead of immediately discrediting an idea, take the time to look at things from the other person's perspective, even when you ultimately disagree with that perspective. Make saying “no” to someone or something your last option, only to be used after thoroughly reviewing all of the evidence before you.  , Instead of merely saying ""yes"" to things, you should be saying, ""yes, and..."" Add your own value to each set of circumstances or ideas to guide things toward your ultimate goal.   For instance, when you're given a project to work on with a group of your peers, don't be afraid to voice your thoughts. Do so even when the others in your group are more experienced than you. You may not have the final answer, but your thoughts could still help move the project along in the right direction.  , Have confidence in the things you say and do, and stand behind your conclusions instead of questioning them under pressure.   Indecision is the enemy of both improvising and progress in general. Don't apologize for your thoughts and don't be shy about sharing them. Instead, simply make an informed choice and see it through, worrying about the results only as they actually happen. As soon as you commit to something, you need to sharpen your focus on that thought, idea, or action. Second-guessing yourself will weaken your ability to react to all aspects of the situation, and it may cause you to prematurely abandon a plan that was actually quite decent.

Properly prepared water in the quantity you'll need to replace. An algae pad for cleaning the glass inside the tank. A large bucket (5 gallons or 10 litres, and bigger) dedicated for this purpose. A simple siphon-type gravel vacuum (NOT a battery-operated gadget). Filter media (cartridges, sponges, carbon packets, and so on) if you're changing the filter this time. Aquarium-safe glass cleaner or a vinegar-based solution. 10% bleach solution in a separate container (optional) Metal or plastic razor blade (optional, be careful with acrylic tanks, as these scratch easier) Also, Make sure that if your fish are pretty picky eaters, you put some water cleaner in with siphoning the water. Siphon half the tank one week, then do the other tank 2-3 weeks later. This will help your fish adjust to a cleaner climate.; , Run it along the glass, scrubbing a little as necessary, to remove algae that is sticking to the aquarium. If you come across a particularly difficult patch of residue, use a razor blade or plastic blade to scrape it off the glass.   You might want to wear rubber gloves to complete this job. Make sure they haven't been treated with any chemicals. Do not just use the sponge or scrubber from your kitchen sink or anything that could have the residue of detergent or cleaning chemicals. A clean, tank-only algae pad will prevent harsh chemicals and detergents from getting into your tank. This step can also be done after you take out 10-20% of the water.  , If you clean your tank on a regular schedule and if your fish are healthy, changing 10-20% of the water once a week should be plenty. If you have a sick fish, you'll want to change more of the water - at least 25% to 50%.  , Start the siphon and direct the old water into a pail, preferably a five-gallon bucket (or larger if necessary). It's best to buy a new bucket and use it only for cleaning your fish tank; residue from soaps or detergents can be harmful to your fish. This means no repurposing the laundry room bucket or the bucket that used to hold your dishwashing cleaning agents.   Aquarium siphons can be purchased that hook up to a sink. If you have one of these, read over the instructions on how they work. This type of siphon also prevents water spilling from the bucket. You can also choose the suction of the water and the temperature when filling the tank using the taps.  , Push the gravel vacuum through the gravel. Fish waste, excess food, and other debris will be sucked into the the vacuum. If you have very small, weak, or delicate fish, you can put a never-worn stocking over the end of the syphon (but be sure the mesh is large enough to get the debris).   If you have sand substrate, do not use the vacuum like a shovel. Use just the hose part of the siphon, not the plastic tube, holding it under an inch from the surface to suck up waste without disturbing your sand. You can use your fingers to run through the sand (provided there are no buried animals to disturb)to help gunk float up that might have gotten trapped under shifting sand.  , Tank decorations need cleaning, too! Excess algae is caused by excess nutrients in the water. You can wipe the decorations off with an algae pad or a never-used soft-bristled toothbrush in the tank water you siphoned out. Avoid the use of soap; it could harm your fishy friend!   If you're having difficulty cleaning the decorations, remove them from the tank and soak the items in a 10% bleach solution for 15 minutes. Then pour boiling water over them and let them air dry before replacing them in the tank. Be very careful to remove all bleach, as to not kill your fish. If your decorations are covered in algae, you may want to feed your fish less or change the water more frequently. Having a pleco in larger tanks can prevent algae from growing excessively.  , Replace the water you took out with fresh, treated water at the temperature of the aquarium. A thermometer is the way to verify the temperature. Staying inside the dictated temperature parameters is crucial for the health of your fish.Remember, lukewarm is too hot for most fish.   If you use tap or faucet water, conditioning the water to remove heavy metals and other toxins that your fish can't process is a must. The easiest thing to do is plan ahead; an old milk container works great. Fill it up the day before and leave it uncovered; one day will allow the chlorine to evaporate and the water to become room temperature, the same as your tank. If you are impulsive, a drop of Decleor will do the trick. Just make sure the temperature is the same. A significant change in temperature will kill your fish. If the nitrates are astronomically high, you can do a special water change of 50% to 75% with distilled water (not normally recommended because the water is so purified, there are no trace nutritional elements for the fish to soak up). You can also use bottled spring water for water changes (with no conditioner) because this water has none of the bad and all of the good elements.  , Many fish (including Mollies, guppies and platies) live longer and healthier lives. Fresh water aquarium salt also helps to prevent diseases such as ich (Ichthyophthirius multifiliis).  , Wait a few hours for any cloudiness that remains to dissipate, leaving the water sparkling clear. Although there are water clearing agents on the market, try not to use them. If the water remains cloudy, it's because of an underlying problem and the agent will only mask (not solve) the issue. Don't forget that your fish need some space between the water and the top of the tank, so that they have enough oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange to breathe and so that they can extend their top fin comfortably.  , Wipe down the outside, including glass, hood, light and tank top. The ammonia fumes from standard cleaners can hurt your fish, so only use solutions that are designated as aquarium-safe. If you'd prefer to make your own cleaner, you can use a vinegar-based solution.  , The carbon inside of the filter cartridge can become detrimental to your fishes' health if left unchanged. Not much beneficial bacteria lives inside the filter, most is in the gravel, so changing it will not affect the biological filtration in any way. The cartridge can be rinsed off weekly when water changes are performed if it appears to be excessively dirty, but you don't want to lose whatever bacteria does happen to set in in the filter. Rinsing the filter cartridge does not substitute changing it, so it still has to be changed monthly.

Don’t get overwhelmed by the variety, though. The most important thing about picking your poodle’s dog food is that it contain one or two whole proteins—for example, “chicken meal” or “lamb meal” and not “poultry meal” or “meat by-product”—at the top of the ingredient list. Avoid foods with a grain or other filler listed as the top ingredient.Many people choose to make their poodle’s food in order to control the recipe and make sure no extraneous chemicals or additives go into it. There are many recipes for homemade dog food, but all of them should have three, fundamental ingredients: meat, vegetables, and a filler carbohydrate such as rice.No matter what prepared or homemade food recipe you opt for, there are certain foods which you should avoid at all costs. For example, keep your poodle away from raw meat, dried fruit, fried foods, and allium vegetables, such as onions and garlic.; , There are three sizes of poodles: standard, which weigh between 40 and 55 pounds, miniature, weighing between 12 and 15 pounds, and toy, weighing five to ten pounds. The size of your poodle determines how much food you should give it, so make sure to follow recommended guidelines in order to avoid weight-related problems in the future.You should consult your vet regarding your poodle's portions, as well as check the specific food labels on your dog food package. That being said, there are some rough guidelines you can use if such information is temporarily unavailable. Toy poodles should consume between ½ and ¾ cups of food per 24 hours, miniatures should have about a cup, and standards between 2 ¼ and 3 cups., Keeping your dog hydrated is essential to good health and nutrition: water lubricates and facilitates practically every function in your dog’s body, including joint cushioning, temperature maintenance, and digestion. If you use wet food, your dog can get quite a lot of its daily hydration requirements from its food, but you should still provide a large bowl of clean water at all times.You might want to consider purchasing a special pet fountain for your dog. Although many of these devices were created for cats who are attracted to running water, they perform multiple functions which are also beneficial to dogs, such as inhibiting bacteria growth and filtering out carbon., You’ve probably seen images of show poodles displaying what looks like a wacky, poofy grooming style.While you don’t need to mimic this look in your pet's style, you still need to follow a fairly strict grooming regimen in order to keep your poodle’s coat from matting. In addition to weekly brushing at home, you should get your poodle professionally groomed and trimmed every six to eight weeks.As a matter of fact, the poodle's trademark pompadours originated not as a decorative feature but out of necessity: having trained their poodles to retrieve ducks from the water, hunters needed a coat style that wouldn’t waterlog and bog them down, but would also keep their joints and cardiovascular system warm in the low temperatures., You should brush your poodle’s teeth daily with a vet-approved canine toothpaste and toothbrush. If you’ve adopted an adult poodle who hasn’t had prior daily dental care, get a professional cleaning done before beginning your daily regimen. This is especially important for toy and miniature poodles, as they tend to have more problems with receding gums.You can further support your poodle’s dental healthy by giving it rawhide bones and special dental treats to chew on. Just be sure to select a rawhide variety which contains no added flavor and is made in the U.S.A., Poodles don’t need as much exercise as some other energetic breeds, but you should still strive to walk them at least twice a day for no less than twenty minutes per walk.This is particularly important for standard poodles, as they are the largest sized poodle and the most active. Toy and miniature poodles require less physical activity, but you should still make sure they get enough exercise to maintain a healthy cardiovascular and digestive system.   A standard poodle can develop superior endurance and speed—some people have even trained for marathons with this boisterous breed!—but you should amp up activity gradually in order to avoid overheating.Backyards can be a great resource to let the poodle run around and play, but, since poodles are highly intelligent and crafty dogs, make sure the yard is well-equipped with tall, durable fences. Scan your fences carefully for any holes or weaknesses before letting your dog run around, and don’t let your dog be outside when you’re not home to supervise.  , Poodles were originally bred in Germany to be trackers and water retrievers, so they have innately excellent senses of smell and intelligence. Field events, hunting, tracking, and agility exercises are all excellent options which let the poodle use these natural skill sets and interests while keeping it mentally engaged and physically active.Tracking training involves getting the dog to follow a tracklayer’s scent over an extended distance, navigate obstacles in the terrain, and find and retrieve an object such as a glove or hat carrying the tracklayer’s scent. If you’re not familiar with the procedure, you can get help with this kind of training through local poodle organizations, obedience classes, or American Kennel Club chapters.  , Poodles are loving, giving dogs, but this also means they need tons of attention in return. They prefer to be with you at all times, so include your dog in anything you can. For example, take it with you to your kids’ baseball game, out on your morning jog, and to your friends’ barbecue.Since poodles don’t tolerate solitude very well, you should provide them with a distraction toy such as a Kong-type food delivery toy when you must leave them alone. Otherwise your poodle will act out and keep its mind occupied through other, often destructive behaviors, such as chewing on furniture or shoes.  , Most experts agree that the best way to train a dog is through positive reinforcement—that is, rewarding behaviors you want the dog to do instead of punishing negative ones. In this approach, you give treats and/or verbal praise when the dog does something good or follows your commands. Just make sure that you give the treat and praise within a few seconds of the correct behavior, as otherwise your dog won’t understand what they’re being rewarded for.Treats should be small, easily chewed, and healthy, so don’t use human foods which get the dog used to salty snacks and can encourage begging. Using individual kernels of your dog’s normal dry food can be a good option.  , You should make sure to get your poodle the rabies, distemper, parvovirus, and adenovirus vaccines at the very least.You can also get a flu shot and other preventative shots for your poodle, but these are not strictly essential according to veterinary guidelines.   For example, if you live in areas with high populations of rattlesnakes or ticks, you might want to consider getting special vaccinations against rattlesnake venom or lyme disease., There are some diseases and conditions such as Addison's and Cushings disease which affect poodles more than they do other breeds, so you should know what to look for and how to prevent developing problems.Symptoms like itchiness, dry skin, or abnormal bumps call for a visit to the vet, while more serious symptoms such as difficult urination, distended abdomen, discolored gums, or cloudy eyes warrant a more urgent trip to the emergency clinic.You should also watch out for symptoms of allergies. Poodles are not a breed particularly prone to food allergies, but keep an eye out for any symptoms such as itchy skin, excessive licking, or ear infections. If you notice any of these problems, visit your local veterinary office and see if they think food could be the cause of your dog’s allergy., In addition to staying current on your dog’s vaccines, you should take it to the vet every year for a standard check-up and blood tests. These tests will indicate any newly developing infections or diseases, and early detection of serious conditions like Addison’s will greatly improve your dog’s chances of recovery and life expectancy.Be proactive about your dog's health by asking your vet some questions whenever you see them. For example, ask if your poodle's weight is within prescribed guidelines, if you should see a specialist about any ongoing problems, or if your dog should get a professional dental cleaning.You also might want to consider purchasing health insurance for your poodle. While poodles are known as generally healthy dogs, veterinary costs can add up quickly if your poodle contracts a disease or has an accident. Ask your vet what they think about it and explore policy options online.",1474,"['protein', 'tracking', 'food', 'teeth', 'poodle', 'member', 'poodle multiple times', 'activities', 'clean water', 'poodle-specific health problems', 'blood screens', 'diet', 'size-appropriate portion', 'family', 'day', 'yearly check-ups', 'times', 'calcium', 'reward positive behaviors', 'field events']"

If you have a facial laceration that is bleeding a lot, you need to get the bleeding under control. Place pressure on the wound, so that the blood will gradually clot and stop flowing.If you are using a bandage or piece of cloth to stop the bleeding, don't take it off to replace it with another piece once it is filled with blood. Instead, simply place another piece of bandage or cloth over the original piece and continue pressure. This will better allow clotting to take place on the surface of the wound.; , If you have a large laceration that is bleeding excessively, you need to get medical care. A doctor or medical professional will be better able to assess the injury, stop bleeding, and treat the laceration.Sometimes a cut is so serious or deep that it won't stop bleeding even when pressure is applied. With injuries such as this, a doctor may need to apply stitches. If the laceration is near your eyes, or if it is impacting your ability to speak or breathe, then you should call 911 immediately. Do not drive yourself if you are injured, as this could put others at risk, so call emergency services or find someone to take you to a doctor.  , If bleeding has stopped and you are sure that immediate medical care is not necessary, start cleaning the wound. Depending on what caused the laceration, your wound may be relatively clean to very dirty. Take a mild soap and warm water and gently clean the wound until you cannot see any dirt or debris and the soap is rinsed away.   You do not want to press on a wound that bleeds easily or that did not clot easily. Instead, take it slowly and gently so that the wound doesn't start bleeding uncontrollably again, and put no pressure on the wound.  , You will just need to keep the area clean, apply a first-aid ointment or antibiotic, and change bandages regularly. This is all in an attempt to keep the area infection free.   If your injury is so minor that you don't go to the doctor, simply continue with basic first aid for a cut. Keep the area clean and avoid irritating it if at all possible.  , If you have a facial laceration, it may be necessary for you to get a tetanus shot. If the wound is dirty and you have not had a tetanus shot in the past five years, you will likely need a booster. If you have not had a tetanus shot in 10 years, you should get one from your doctor, even if the wound appears clean., If your cut has been stitched up by a doctor, you will need to keep them clean in order to avoid infection. Follow your doctor's advice about aftercare, including washing and cleaning the area and replacing bandages.You will want to clean the wound area daily; however, avoid submerging the stitched area in water until the cut has healed. Instead of stitches, your doctor may apply Steri-Strips to more minor cuts. These are adhesive strips that serve the same function as stitches but don't require the pain of stitches., Most lacerations do not require anything stronger than an over-the-counter painkiller. Follow the directions on the bottle, making sure to follow the recommended daily dosages.   If you have been taking over-the-counter painkillers and they are not sufficiently dulling your pain, consult with your doctor about getting a prescription for something stronger; however, your doctor may simply tell you to take additional over-the-counter painkillers. Ibuprofen can inhibit clotting and can increase bleeding. If the wound was recently bleeding, talk to your doctor before taking ibuprofen.  , Though cleaning the wound is a good idea, too much soap or water could irritate the cut. Try putting a dry washcloth or towel over the cut while you are in the shower to keep the water out.Taking a bath should be ok while recovering from a facial laceration, as your face does not need to be in the water to take a bath. However, be sure to keep it out of the water as much as possible and avoid submerging the laceration at all. This can irritate the wound and prevent proper healing.  , This depends on how much blood you lost and how serious the injury is.  , Depending on where the stitches are, eating can be difficult. If the injury is on the chin or near the lip, you might have to eat or drink small things or amounts in order keep the food out of the laceration.   Consider eating liquid meals through a straw if the laceration is bad and interferes with your ability to eat. This will allow you to keep the laceration clean and keep getting enough nutrients.  , An infected cut will usually turn red and puffy.It will become more tender and may have a discharge.   If you think your laceration is infected, you should have it looked at by a medical professional.  , If a child has gotten a serious facial laceration you should make sure that their brain was not affected by the same force that injured the child. Make sure your child is able to talk without being confused and is able to move around normally after an injury to the head. If there is concern for a concussion, your child should be seen by a medical professional who can determine the need for a CT scan of the head. Your child should also be kept under close observation for 24 hours after the injury.Know that it is ok for your child to sleep. Along with being pale, children are often sleepy after an injury. It is ok to allow your kid to sleep but be sure to check on her condition every two to four hours.  , A child won't always alert you that an injury is not healing properly. When changing bandages, check to make sure that the injury is healing nicely.   The wound is likely to be red and puffy for awhile, but it should usually not be oozing pus that is white, green or yellow. Lacerations are places where a serious infection can enter your child's body. This is why it is so important to keep an eye on his injury., If the area around the stitches becomes infected, contact your doctor about whether to bring the child in to be assessed. A true infection will require professional cleaning and antibiotics in order to heal.

However, there are a few signs you can look for that might indicate that your friend feels the same way. Some signs of romantic interest might include that she:Finds reasons to run into you when you don’t have plans to hang out Likes to bring up inside jokes or memories you two share Follows and likes a lot of what you do and say on social media; , Body language can say a lot about how people feel, including whether your friend is interested in you the same way you are in her. Body language to watch for that suggests romantic interest includes:She might expose her wrists. It's a sign of submission females use to attract males. If she is not wearing long sleeves, it may just be exposing the underside of her wrists by turning one upwards, possibly while holding a wine glass or smoking a cigarette. She might try to close distances between you, such as by sitting beside or across from you, passing you things often, or even edging her drink closer toward you Touching her neck and looking at you Playing with the rim of her glass when you're having dinner or drinks Making frequent eye contact with you, even if she looks away after locking eyes  , Asking a friend on a date can be risky, and you want to make sure the timing is right before you commit. You should be sure she isn't already seeing someone else, otherwise you might put yourself, her, and your friendship in an awkward position.   To find out if she's dating anyone, try to bring it up casually. Try saying something like, “Have you met anyone interesting on Tinder lately,” or, “So did things ever work out with that guy you were seeing a while back.” If you're not comfortable asking her yourself, you can always ask mutual friends if she's seeing anyone.  , One of the simplest and most effective ways to find out if your friend feels the same way that you do is to ask her. It may seem forward, but you will end up with a much more accurate answer than if you try to figure it out on your own. If you're not sure what to say, try:   “Have you ever thought about us as more than friends?” “If we were to go on a date, where would you take me?” “Do you think about us when we aren't together?” “Do you have feelings for me beyond friendship?”  , When you’ve been friends with a girl for a long time, you'll likely have a good idea of the qualities and characteristics she typically finds attractive in a person. If you have any of these qualities, emphasize them when you spend time with her.For example, if your friend finds humor to be an attractive quality and thinks you're funny, tell even more jokes when she's around. Similarly, if there are particular physical characteristics that your friend likes, wear clothes that emphasize that part of your body when you're together. While it’s good to accentuate qualities that you already have, it’s important that you don’t pretend to have certain qualities just to impress your friend. She will likely see through your ruse, and if she doesn’t, you'll be stuck pretending to be someone you aren't.  , Flirting is a great and subtle way to suggest that you're interested and to arouse new feelings in your friend. This is important because you have to get her to see you as a possible love interest, rather than just a friend. There are a number of ways you can flirt with her, including:Orient your body to face her when you two are talking, and lean in slightly when you're engaged in conversation. Sit closer to her than you normally do when you're together. Make frequent eye contact with her, and allow your gaze to linger. Laugh often around her and smile at her frequently  , One major thing that will have to change in order for your friend to see you as a love interest is that you'll have to start treating her like one. This includes:   Complimenting and flattering her Paying for meals and drinks now and then Giving her your undivided attention Not talking about other women that you're attracted to Picking her up and driving her home sometimes  , One of the biggest things that may change between you and your friend if you start dating is the amount of physical contact you share. You can start by:Touching her arm or hand more often Touching her back or shoulders Grazing her foot with yours Resting your hand on her leg briefly, This means engaging in activities that you would normally reserve for someone you were dating. You can do this without actually asking your friend out yet. Instead, when you're planning time together, suggest date-type outings and events.This could include:   Having dinner at a romantic restaurant Going dancing Seeing a movie together Cooking for her at your house  , Friendships can be delicate, and unrequited romantic feelings can cause awkwardness. Asking out a friend can change the friendship, change group dynamics with mutual friends, and can even end the friendship.   Be aware that asking your friend out might strain the relationship, and you may not see each other for a while. Once you ask your friend out, she may not feel comfortable being friends with you anymore. Even if you want to keep it private, your mutual friends might find out as well, and relationships with them could also become strained., While you might ask a stranger out on a date in front of other friends, the dynamic is different when it’s someone you're already friends with. When you're planning to ask her, make sure that:She’s in a place where she's comfortable You can both leave separately if necessary You're alone or not around other friends  , Avoid approaching the subject like you have a secret you want to tell her, and don’t start by saying you’ve had feelings for her for a while.   Instead, ask your friend out just like you would if she were any other crush., No matter how nervous you are, on the outside you should try to act like this is any other meeting between you two. Act as though you know she's going to say yes, and when you ask her out:Be direct Look her in the eyes when you ask, not at the ground Try not to be too nervous, and avoid fidgeting Stand or sit up straight Keep your chin up  , While you should broach the topic of the date with your friend like you would anyone else, you might want to make the proposition a little more special. Since you know her and know what she likes, customize the date for her.Be sure to include a specific time and date. To ask her out, say something like:   “I know you’ve been dying to try that new restaurant, and I want to take you there at 8 p.m. this Saturday, just you and me. What do you say, is it a date?” “You keep talking about that adventure. Let’s go on a date this Sunday at noon and I’ll take you.”  , When you’ve been friends with someone for a long time, asking her to hang out with you could seem like any other platonic get-together.Make sure you say that you want to go on a date with her, and be clear that the date is romantic.   Do not use the term “hang out,” or she may think you mean any old get-together. Make sure you use the word “date” when you ask her out. Be sure to mention it will just be the two of you. If she asks you something like, “You mean you want to go on a date,” answer with a confident “yes.”  , Often times, people don’t want to date friends because they cherish the friendship and worry about how a date or break-up could change things. Reassure your friend that the friendship is important to you too, and that you don’t want to lose her, but want to take the relationship to a deeper level.You can say something like:   “Your friendship means more to me than a romantic relationship, and I don’t want to risk that, but still want to ask you out” “I want to be friends with you no matter what, even if you aren't interested” “I still want to be friends, but am also curious about what we’d be like on a date together.”  , The situation will only be awkward if you allow it to be, so you must go in to this prepared for her to say no. Continue on with your friendship as you normally would.Be patient as well. It’s entirely possible that she said no because your question caught her off guard. After having some time to think about it, she may realize she actually does have feelings for you.

Look for alerts about heat advisories and excessive heat warnings. A heat advisory will be issued if forecasts predict that a temperature of at least 100°F (37.8°C) will last for more than 2 hours, and an excessive heat warning is issued if temperatures exceeding 105°F (40.6°C) are forecast to last for at least 2 hours.Australian residents can look out for a Heat Watch (temperatures forecast to be above 36°C for more than 3 days) and a Heat Warning (40° or higher forecast for at least 3 days).; , In the case of any kind of national heat alert, make every effort to stay indoors if you have air conditioning.Draw all blinds and curtains to keep out the heat of the sun.Turn on ceiling fans to redistribute the cool air from the air conditioner more efficiently., If you don’t have air conditioning, try to spend the late morning and afternoon hours in public buildings that do, such as libraries, malls, community centers, and grocery stores.If these places are far from your residence, and you don’t drive, ask a friend, neighbor, or relative to drive you.   If you don’t have air conditioning, and can’t get to an air conditioned public building, stay on the lowest floor in your residence, out of the sun. If you begin to feel overheated, take a cold bath or shower., Whether you’re at home or in a public building, be sure to drink more water than you normally do, even if you don’t feel thirsty. Room temperature water is fine, since ice-cold water can bring on stomach cramps.And be sure to avoid alcoholic beverages as well during a heat wave, since these can reduce the body’s ability to cool itself.Seniors should make sure they're getting at least eight 8-ounce (0.24 liters) glasses of water throughout the day.Adult women need at least nine 8-ounce glasses (2.13 liters) per day, and adult men should drink a little more than twelve-and-a-half 8-ounce glasses (3 liters) daily. , If you know of any relatives, friends, or neighbors who do not have air conditioning, give them a call or go to see them during a national heat alert. Make sure that their air conditioning system is working properly. If you are seeing about an elderly person, make sure they can access transportation to a public building or shelter, or offer to give them a ride to these places or to your home., If you must leave your residence on a day when there is a national heat alert, try to avoid going out between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., which are generally the hottest hours of the day.Do all you can to postpone any errands or meetings that can wait for a few days until the heat alert is no longer in effect.  , If you will be driving, open all the car doors for five minutes before starting the car, to allow for ventilation. Then turn on the air conditioning for a few minutes before getting in the vehicle and driving.   Do not drive without air conditioning during a national heat alert. Try to park in a shaded area at your destination and when you return home.  , To shield yourself from the sun, wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing made of cotton or linen. Cover as much exposed skin as possible with pants and long sleeves.Apply high-spf (30-60) sunblock to any exposed skin areas, including the face and neck, and wear a wide-brimmed hat., Drink two to four glasses, or 2 cups (0.5 L) to 4 cups (0.9 L)) of cool fluids each hour if you’re exercising outdoors or working indoors when outdoor temperatures are higher than 90°C (32.2°C).This will prevent dehydration and allow your body to cool itself naturally by sweating.   Be careful to avoid exercising outdoors in the event of a national heat alert, or generally if outdoor temperatures are higher than 98°F (36.67°C).  , In no case is it safe to leave a child in the car, especially during warmer weather. The inside of a vehicle can overheat to deadly temperatures (110°F / 43.3°C), even when outside temperatures are mildly warm (60°F / 15.6°C).And opening windows slightly doesn’t help, since the vehicle still overheats quickly with a little ventilation.   To help you remember to take your child with you when leaving the vehicle, leave something next the the child that you will need to have with you, such as a cell phone, purse, shopping bag, or hat., Heat exhaustion is a type of heat stress that can lead to heat stroke. Once you notice signs of heat exhaustion, stop any activity and get yourself or the ailing person to an air conditioned building immediately. This precaution can prevent the life-threatening condition of heat stroke from coming on.   Symptoms of heat exhaustion include vomiting and nausea, excessive sweating, low blood pressure, moist and cool skin, a weak pulse, fatigue and weakness, blurred vision, strong thirst, and rapid breathing.  , Once you notice the signs of heat exhaustion, and after finding a cool indoor area, you should give yourself or the ailing person cool water to drink, take off or loosen any excess clothing, fan yourself or the ailing person, and spray the skin with cool water.If these symptoms continue, go to an emergency medical center or call local emergency services., In some cases, heat stroke can come on quickly without giving any indication of heat exhaustion.This is a life-threatening condition, so if you detect the signs of heat stroke in yourself or another, call or ask someone else to call an ambulance immediately.   Symptoms of heat stroke include dry, hot, red skin (because the body has stopped sweating); a temperature above 104°F (40°C); weakness, confusion, irritability, or strange behavior; a rapid pulse; dizziness or headache; convulsions; and loss of consciousness., If signs of heat stroke are present, and you are alone, call for an ambulance immediately, and then do your best to get to a cool and shaded area—preferably to an air conditioned building— while waiting for the emergency services. If you are in a wilderness area, away from facilities, sit in the shade of a tree or underneath a rock outcropping. If you are with an ailing person, do the same for them.   Ask someone for (or give yourself or the ailing person) sips of cool water as long as you or they are conscious.Remove/loosen all outer layers of clothing and shoes and socks. Cool off yourself, have someone else cool you off, or cool down the other person by sponging or spraying the skin with cool water.Place ice packs underneath the armpits and on the back of the neck.",1125,"['symptoms', 'immediate care', 'spot signs', 'others', 'heat exhaustion', 'sunblock', 'air conditioning', 'vehicle', 'child', 'check weather reports', 'preventive care', 'heat stroke', 'good time', 'car', 'drink extra water', 'public building', 'protective clothing']"

Though you don’t have to choose a particular major in order to become a P.E. teacher, many states will require you to have at least taken certain courses, so check your state’s requirements. It is more common for secondary-school teachers to be required to major in their chosen area of instruction than it is for primary-school teachers.; , Most post-graduate teaching programs require applicants to have a minimum number of classroom experience hours.   The amount of required classroom hours may vary depending on the teaching program to which you’re applying, so do your research. Many universities offer programs that place students in local classrooms to help them gain experience. Inquire with your university if such programs are available to you.  , If you want to be involved in physical education, be sure you yourself are familiar with both physical education and with playing sports.   A great way to get experience with sports and physical education is to volunteer to be a coach or assistant coach for a local school or league team.  , If your university offers courses in education, it’s recommended that you take at least several such courses.   Education courses will not only help you determine if teaching is a good fit for you, but also help prepare you for the kind of coursework you’ll be required to take as part of your post-graduate education.  , Once you’ve earned your bachelor’s degree, the next step on the way to gaining your teaching license is attending a post-graduate program.   While attending a post-graduate program in education isn’t required to earn your teaching license, it is strongly recommended because it will make meeting the licensure requirements much easier.Teaching credential programs are typically about a year long, while Master’s programs are usually at least two. Though not required, having a Master’s degree in a relevant subject will make you more competitive, and many schools will offer Master’s-degree holders higher salaries.A variety of teaching credential and Master’s programs are available across the U.S., but you still need to be sure to do your research so that you can find the program that will meet your needs. When researching teaching programs, consider factors such as the accreditation of the program, the curriculum, the completion requirements, the length of the program, the cost, the admission requirements, the availability of financial assistance, the number of accepted students, the number of faculty, the size of the institution, and the location of the campus. Remember that teaching credentials are state-specific, so choose a program in the state where you want to teach. If you earn your credential in California but want to teach in Alabama, you’ll have to repeat several steps in order to earn your Alabama credential.  , You’ll be required to earn a certain number of classroom-experience hours.   The amount of hours required to earn your license will vary by state, so look up your state’s specific requirements.  , In addition to graduating from a teaching program and earning classroom experience, you’ll also need to pass your state’s required exams to earn your teaching license.   Each state offers its own particular exams, and the procedures for taking the exam(s) may vary, so refer again to your state’s specific requirements. The credentialing exam typically measures your basic knowledge as well as your subject and grade specific knowledge. To learn more about your state’s exam, do a search for your state’s name and “teaching exam.”  , Each state has unique requirements for earning your license. Go to your state’s Department of Education website to find details on all of the state-specific requirements.   Bear in mind that though you must have a license to teach in your state, earning teacher certification is optional, though it typically offers certain professional advantages including prestige and higher earning potential.Alternative licensure is also available in lieu of a teaching credential. If you have your bachelor’s degree but didn’t pursue a credential after college and/or if you’re changing careers, you may pursue an alternative license by finding placement in a classroom working under the supervision of a licensed teacher. While teaching, you’ll also take required coursework. You will typically need to teach and take coursework for one to two years before earning your license. Again, licensing requirements vary by state, so look into the specifics for your state., Though application requirements may vary by school, there are common documents you can expect to need, including:   An updated resume. Make sure your resume reflects your most recent education, awards, and activities and that it’s completely error-free. Remove any old or irrelevant information. For details on writing your resume, see How to Write a Resume. A cover letter. Your cover letter should be specific to each job and should discuss your interest in and qualification for the specific job to which you’re applying. For more information on writing a cover letter, see How to Write a Cover Letter. A teaching statement. Your teaching statement should state your goals, reasons for pursuing teaching, teaching/pedagogical philosophy, teaching methodology, and goals. A teaching statement should identify your teaching interests and goals, concrete examples of how you have and will accomplish those goals, discuss with specific examples issues you’ve faced and resolved in the classroom, which courses you’re interested in teaching, and strong and supportive statements from student evaluations, if available.References. Many job postings will want you to include a list of references; your reference list should provide the name and contact information of professionals who know your work well and can offer you a positive recommendation. Be sure to ask each reference if you may list them before doing so.  , After earning your teaching license, you’re ready to begin looking for a job. here are several places you can begin looking:Check with the boards of education/school districts in the area. On the website of most boards of education you can find available job listings, information about the district’s hiring process, and lists of upcoming job fairs. Go to job fairs. Job fairs are opportunities for job seekers to meet with organizations offering jobs. When going to a job fair, treat it as an interview: dress professionally, bring copies of your resume, and hand them out to as many people as you can.

This is also a really good flirting technique. Holding his gaze, especially if the two of you are talking, will create a connection between you two pretty quickly.If a lot of times you look up, and he's looking at you, that's a good sign. It means that he likes looking at you, but he might be too shy to make his interest known or to approach you!; , Subconsciously, people want to be close to a person that they're interested in. If he's leaning towards you it means that he's comfortable with you and that he wants to be near you. These are very good indicators of his interest.If he moves to get closer to you, this is also a good sign. For example: if the two of you are walking together and his arm keeps brushing up against yours. This can be a subtle, mostly subconscious movement, or it can be much less subtle. You can use a bit of moving closer of your own to flirt with him. For example, you might walk around a puddle on his side of the puddle so that you get closer to him.  , People tend to subconsciously mirror the body language of people that they like. If he's mirroring movements and postures that you're making that's a good sign that his subconscious is paying attention to you.   For example: he takes a sip of his drink a few moments after you do. Or he rests his arms on the table when you do. You can use this to flirt with him, as well. Mirror some of his movements. If he crosses his legs, cross yours. When he takes a sip of his drink, wait a few moments and then take a sip of yours.  , Touch is a great indicator of interest. Unless the two of you have been friends for a while and he's completely comfortable with you, it's unlikely that he's going to touch you a lot.   Some ambiguous touching might be: hands brushing when you're walking together (could be on purpose, could be accidental), patting you on the back (this seems more a friends type touch), anything ""guy-ish"" (like fist-bumps, high fives, and the like). Touches that are more likely to designate interest: he puts his hand or arm on the small of your back to guide you, when he hugs you the hug lingers (he may brush his hand down your back or along your side), he puts his arm around you. You can use touch to flirt back with him. Put your hand on his arm when you're talking to him. Nudge him when you say something funny (and grin at him).  , If a guy is interested in you, even if he's ignoring you, he's going to want to be around you. You'll notice that every time you turn around, it seems he's somewhere nearby. Again, even if he's ignoring you, if he's interested he's going to make sure to ignore you nearby.   If he remembers what you tell him, that is one of the best signs. That means that not only was he listening to what you were saying, that he cared enough to remember it. If he's only in it for sex or for his own ego, he might pretend like he's listening, but he probably won't actually be listening. Make sure that you listen to him as well. He'll love that you're interested in him and that you remember what he says to you. It'll show that you think he's important.  , A lot of times if a guy's into you he's going to be a bit nervous around you. This is because he wants to make a good impression on you, so he's going to be trying to act cool.   Look for things like unexplained laughter, sweaty palms, or fidgeting but if he's keeping you in the friend zone, then don't bother with him. He might have a little difficulty maintaining eye contact with you without becoming a little uncomfortable. Do your best to make him comfortable. Tell him about that time you spilled a drink all over yourself at your work party, or something to make you seem human and not inhumanly awesome.  , If a guy likes you he's going to want to impress you and he's going to want to be there for you. If a guy is doing nice things for you he's probably a little bit interested in you, especially if those things are coupled with some of the other signs.He might do something like lend you his jacket when you're cold, or he might offer to buy your coffee drink even though you aren't dating, or he might offer to drive you to the airport when you have to catch a flight. Do nice things back to him. This way he'll see that you are someone who doesn't take other people for granted and that you notice and appreciate what it is that he's doing. If you aren't interested in him try not to take advantage of his interest in you.  , A guy who likes you is going to want to, subtly or unsubtly, tell you how much he appreciates you. Hopefully this will extend beyond simply compliments about your appearance, but those can be nice, too.He might compliment you on a new haircut (which means that he's been paying attention), or tell you that you're doing an awesome job on that project for school.  , As said above, if a guy likes you (really likes you) he's going to want to know about you. That means that he's going to listen and remember when you talk. If he isn't listening, it's a pretty good bet that he's not interested. You can do better!   He's also unlikely to ask you any questions about yourself. This is a guy you definitely want to stay away from. Either he's not interested, or he is interested, but he's too much of a narcissist to really see you as a fully fledged person who's interesting in their own right.  , While some guys can be nervous about making eye contact with a person they're interested in, at some point they usually do so. If he's looking at the room instead of you, especially if he doesn't seem to be listening to you, then he's definitely not interested.   A big warning sign for someone like this is if he's too busy checking his phone to listen to you. It means that he's more interested in other people than he is in you.  , His body language can tell you a bit about how he's feeling, whether he's interested or not interested. If he isn't interested his body language should make that pretty clear.   He never tries to get closer to you, or touch you, even subtly. If he doesn't do particularly nice things for you, or anything for you, this could be a sign that he's not interested. Again, even if a guy is shy or dealing with his interest by ignoring you, he's still going to want to be around you. If the guy is never around, well, that's a sign he's not interested.  , With a very, very few exceptions, a guy will get in touch with a girl he's interested in. He will. A text message takes five seconds to write and send, even if it's just an ""I'm busy at work. I'll text you later."" A guy who is interested in you won't leave you hanging, especially if he wants you so bad., If the guy always manages to wriggle out of meeting your friends he's probably not that interested in you. Yeah, you don't want to introduce him to all the friends right off the bat, but if it's been a while and he's still the mystery man to your friends? He's not that interested.   This is also true if he avoids introducing you to his friends. It shows that he's not very serious about you, because otherwise he'd be dying to show you off to his buddies.

If they're not hurting anyone, what's the problem? Chill people don't look for reasons or opportunities to hate on others just for being different. There's no reason to bully or tread on other people's territory. Try to be happy with yourself and encourage self-love in others, too and remember be yourself.; , Unless someone is rude to you, your day should go by smoothly by being polite, considerate, and nice. Chill people don't antagonize for the sake of it or stir up a bunch of negative emotions by being jerks; chill people are generally kind and get along well with others. However, try to avoid going overboard so you don't become a people-pleaser or pushover.  , Take your life in stride. Roll with the punches and be accepting of the little things life throws your way, reserving your passion for what matters to you most. This is pretty much the defining feature of a chill person.  , Don't be someone who is really boring and afraid to try new things. Go out and do stuff you consider fun and be someone that other people want to spend time with. Talk with people, go see movies, play games, go on hikes or go camping: it's all good!  , Be unique. A chill person doesn't feel the need to follow all the trends set by others, they just do what they want and what makes them happy. This laid back attitude inspires others to be more laid back and people will want to be around you more often.  , Some things in life are bound to upset or anger you, and while it's okay to have those feelings, it's best not to nosedive into every argument that presents itself. Stop, take a deep breath, and decide whether an unpleasant situation is worth getting into. Catch yourself before you get stuck in a pointless argument or a big scene. From here, you can redirect the situation to be in your favor.  , Distract yourself from your immediate feelings by redirecting your thoughts. There are lots of ways you can do this. You can count your breaths. You can even sing a song (inside your head is probably better than out loud). , Studies have show that we can reduce a significant amount of stress by chewing gum. Pop a stick of that winter fresh if you’re just not feeling calm in the moment. , Think about how much your problem matters in the grand scheme of things. Will it still affect you a year from now? Does it even help to be so hard on yourself? If you made it out alive, chances are you’ll find a way to get through it and move on to more happiness and hardships.  , By the time we’re much older, we usually don’t get so worried when things don’t go our way, because we get used to it. Think of how your grandma would react in a situation and do that. She’d probably say something funny and then move on to the next thing, which is really the best thing to do if you want to stay sane.  , If you just can’t handle the situation, take yourself out of it. No reason to stick around if you’re going to lose your cool and make some mistakes. Remove yourself from the room for a few minutes and then try again once you’ve managed to work through the initial anger or fear (or whatever you’re feeling).  , Avoiding such things is the best way to be chill in life. Just say no to all the bullies, liars, and trash-talkers. You don’t need that in your life! Cut toxic people out of your life and don’t go around causing trouble yourself. Don’t start none, ain’t gonna be none.  , There's a difference between being chill and being passive. Instead of sitting around thinking your problems could be worse, always try to make things better for yourself. It'll be a lot easier to be genuinely laid-back when you're satisfied with your life as opposed to settling for less.  , When you have lots of self confidence and comfort with who you are, you will have a much easier time being chill. You will know that it’s okay if you make a mistake, that it doesn’t make you worthless or something like that. You will know you can handle whatever crazy life manages to throw at you.  , Do things in life that make you happy. Don’t do things that stress you out just to accommodate others and not yourself. Doing things that make you happy will make you more calm and relaxed, helping you deal with all your problems in a better way.  , Not caring what others think will make many situations in your life less stressful, like arguments and rumors.  , You’ve got to laugh about stuff in life, especially the stuff that doesn’t go your way, or you’re going to spend life grumpy and stressed out. When someone is a jerk to you, relieve your anger through humor. Just laugh at them because they are clearly very boring and miserable.  , Always be quick about getting things done instead of procrastinating and leaving them until the last minute. This will give you fewer things to stress about and let you take a laid-back approach to life.  , Listen to some music that will calm you down. Different music works for different people, of course, but generally soothing music will make you more chill then some hard-core rock. Look for music with low, calming sounds. You will know that music is calming when you notice that your pulse is lower. , When you notice that you’re getting too tense and worked up, try chilling out by playing with some cute little kids or animals. Kids especially have such a happy view of the world and themselves, and their outlook can often change how you view your own life. If you don’t have little kids in your life, think about volunteering with Big Brothers, Big Sisters (or a similar organization).  , Physically getting up and moving, and proper exercise especially, can have a really big impact on how you feel emotionally. If you feel like you’re having problems being chill, go out for a run and see how you feel when you get back. You might be surprised!  , A funny movie is a great way to relax and get into a chill mindset. You can watch cartoon movies that you loved as a kid or you can watch some more grown-up movies that make you laugh instead. Movies like Dodgeball are usually good for a laugh, Bridesmaids is a great movie, and Office Space will be sure to have you laughing at your own life in no time.  , Another great way to chill is to play a game. You can play video games, board games, card games, or whatever you like. You can play alone or with other people. Games are a great way to exercise your brain and get your mind off of the problems and stresses in your life. It can also be a great way to bond with people that you love, which can really make your life more chill.

You can do this based on who won the last game, a coin toss, or by any other method. The person who will go first will take the black checkers and the other will take the white.Keep in mind that in checkers, the player with the black checkers always goes first.; , Sit across from your opponent and place the board between you and your opponent. The board is made up of 64 alternating dark and light squares which appear in 8 rows of 8. There are 32 light squares and 32 dark squares. Place the board so that each player has a light colored square on the corner of the board on his or her right side., Have each player place his pieces on the 12 dark squares in the first three rows closest to him or her. Each of these three rows should have a total of 4 checkers. Keep in mind that checkers may only move in diagonal directions on the dark squares.Since the board has 8 rows, 6 of the rows will be taken up by the players' checkers and two rows will be left open in the middle of the board.  , In tournament checkers games, each player gets five minutes to make a move. If you want to time each other’s moves to keep the game moving along, make sure that you place a timer near the checkers board before you begin a game., The player with the black checkers moves first. Checkers may only move one diagonal space forward (toward your opponent’s checkers) in the beginning of the game. Remember that checkers must stay on the dark squares., If your checker is located in the diagonal space nearest to your opponent's checker, then you can jump and capture that checker. To capture a checker, just jump over it by moving two diagonal spaces in the direction of the checker, like you are hopping over your opponent's checker. Once you capture the checker, you can take it off the board.Keep in mind that a space on the other side of your opponent’s checker has to be empty so that you can move into it. If you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker, then you have to take it. If you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker in multiple parts of the board, then you can choose which checkers you'd like to jump. If you're capturing a checker, you can still only move forward once. But if the new position you land in gives you a direct opportunity to capture another checker, then you must keep going until you can't jump any more of your opponent's checkers.  , To crown a checker and make it a king checker, simply place one of your own captured pieces on top of it. Because of its height, you will be able to tell it apart from the other pieces. The king can move forward and backward, so it's easier for king checkers to capture your opponent's checkers.Kings can still only move one diagonal space at a time during a non-capture move. However, when a king is capturing checkers, it can move forward and backward on the same turn. This would apply only if a a king was doing a capture move that required it to change directions, such as if two checkers were lined up on diagonal spaces that fall into the same horizontal line. To capture these checkers, the king would have to jump forwards and then backwards. Some checkers sets have a crown on the back of the checkers, so you can just flip a piece over once it is crowned to designate it as the king. There is no limit to how many crowned pieces you can have.  , Continue jumping and capturing your opponent's checkers until they are all removed from the board. Once you have captured all of your opponent’s checkers, you have won the game!A less common way to win is when all of your opponent's pieces are blocked so that your opponent can't make any more moves.  , A beginner may be tempted to keep his pieces at the edges of the board and to try to avoid the opponent's checkers as much as possible, but this is a mistake. Work on capturing your opponent’s checkers rather than going out of your way to defend your own. It’s okay if some of your pieces get captured as long as you capture more of your opponent’s pieces.   Be bold and try to capture your opponent's checkers whenever you can.  , If you move a stray checker a few squares forward without moving the rest of your checkers, that piece will be vulnerable to capture. Instead, try keeping some of your checkers together, like a blockade. The center of the board is a good place to a have a group of checkers protecting each other as they move forward. Just try not to move all of your checkers towards the center because it will be hard to move them.If your checkers move together, it will be harder for your opponent to capture your checkers. But if your opponent does still manage to capture your checker, then you'll have a piece waiting to capture his checker as well.  , If your opponent gets a piece to your back row, then it will be crowned and more difficult to capture. Keeping a full back row is the best way to keep your opponent from crowning his pieces. It will also make it easier for you to capture any opposing pieces that approach your back row., There's a right time for you to sacrifice your checkers. If you're ahead in the game, or even dead even with your opponent, don't be afraid to sacrifice a piece if it means you'll be able to capture your opponent's piece back or gain a significant positional advantage. Keep the forward momentum going.Do what you can to avoid having your king captured. The king is much more valuable than a regular checker. Don't trade pieces if it will make it easier for your opponent to king a piece. Trade one for two. Give up one of your pieces if it means you can capture two of your opponent's pieces in return.  , You should focus on crowning as many of your pieces as possible, as well as on keeping your opponent from crowning his pieces. This should be a priority as you advance in the game. However, don't crown your pieces if it means losing several checkers on the way. Be strategic about knowing when to crown your piece.  , Try to keep his active pieces blocked if you can, so he will be forced to play with pieces such as those in the back row. If all your opponent's pieces are blocked and cannot move, then he will lose. You can also work on capturing more of your opponent’s pieces or crowning your own.  , Though there's no fool-proof way to win at checkers every single time, the more you play, the more you'll understand how to strategize. If you want to be a checkers expert, you should try to play as much as you can to improve your game.Try playing with someone above your skill level. This will challenge you and will force you to pick up your game.  , Watch an expert checkers player, either in person or on television. You'll pick up a lot of pointers just by watching an expert maneuver his pieces around the board. Pay attention to what the expert does in certain situations.Try reading about checkers strategies online or in books as well. Some checkers experts have written about their strategies and reading about them may help you to improve your game.

The most popular one is Cygwin, which is available for free from the developer’s website. Download and install it like you would any other program. Another popular free program is PuTTY.During the Cygwin installation, you must choose to install OpenSSH from the Net section. Linux and Mac OS X come with SSH already installed on the system. This is because SSH is a UNIX system, and Linux and OS X are derived from UNIX. If you have Windows 10 with the Anniversary Update, you can install the Windows Subsystem for Linux which comes with SSH preinstalled.; , Open the terminal program that is installed by Cygwin, or Bash on Ubuntu on Windows for Windows 10, or open the Terminal in OS X or Linux. SSH uses the terminal interface to interact with other computers. There is no graphical interface for SSH, so you will need to get comfortable typing in commands.  , Before you dive into creating secure keys and moving files, you’ll want to test that SSH is properly configured on your computer as well as the system you are connecting to. Enter the following command, replacing <username> with your username on the remote computer, and <remote> with the address for the remote computer or server:   $ ssh <username>@<remote> You will be asked for your password once the connection is established. You will not see the cursor move or any characters input when you type your password. If this step fails, then either SSH is configured incorrectly on your computer or the remote computer is not accepting SSH connections.  , When you first connect to the remote computer, you should be located in your HOME directory. To move around the directory structure, use the cd command:cd .. will move you up one directory.  cd <directoryname> will move you into the specified subdirectory.  cd /home/directory/path/ will move you into the specified directory from the root (home).  cd ~ will return you to your HOME directory.  , To see what files and folders in your current location, you can use the ls command:ls will list all of the files and folders in your current directory.  ls –l will list the contents of the directory along with additional information such as size, permissions, and date.  ls-a will list all the contents including hidden files and folders.  , If you need to copy files from your local computer to the computer you are accessing remotely, you can use the scp command:    scp /localdirectory/example1.txt <username>@<remote>:<path> will copy example1.txt to the specified <path> on the remote computer. You can leave <path> blank to copy to the root folder of the remote computer.  scp <username>@<remote>:/home/example1.txt ./ will move example1.txt from the home directory on the remote computer to the current directory on the local computer.  , You can use the cp command to make copies of files either in the same directory or into a directory of your choosing:    cp example1.txt example2.txt will create a copy of example1.txt called example2.txt in the same location.  cp example1.txt <directory>/ will create a copy of example1.txt in the location specified by <directory>.  , If you want to change a file’s name or move it without copying, you can use the mv command:    mv example1.txt example2.txt will rename example1.txt to example2.txt. The file will stay in the same location.  mv directory1 directory2 will rename directory1 to directory2. The directory’s contents will remain unchanged.  mv example1.txt directory1/ will move example1.txt into directory1.  mv example1.txt directory1/example2.txt will move example1.txt into directory1 and rename it to example2.txt  , If you need to remove anything from the computer you are connected to, you can use the rm command:    rm example1.txt will delete the file example1.txt.  rm –I example1.txt will delete the file example1.txt after prompting you to confirm.  rm directory1/ will delete directory1 and all of its contents.  , You can change the read and write privileges of your files using the chmod command:    chmod u+w example1.txt will add the write (modify) permission to the file for the user (u). You can also use the g modifier for group permissions or the o for world permissions.  chmod g+r example1.txt will add the read (access) permission to the file for the group. There are a large list of permissions that you can use to secure or open various aspects of your system., There are a few more important commands that you will be using quite a bit in the shell interface. They include:    mkdir newdirectory will create a new subdirectory called newdirectory.  pwd will display your current directory location.  who shows who is logged into the system.  pico newfile.txt or vi newfile.txt will create a new file and open the file editor. Different system will have different file editors installed. The most common are pico and vi. You may need to use different commands if you have a different file editor installed.  , If you are unsure as to what a command will do, you can use the man command to learn about all of the possible uses and parameters:    man <command> will display information about that command.  man –k <keyword> will search all of the man pages for the keyword you specify., These keys will allow you to connect to the remote location without having to enter your password each time. This is a much more secure way to connect to the remote computer, as the password will not have to transmitted over the network.   Create the key folder on your computer by entering the command $ mkdir .ssh  Create the public and private keys by using the command $ ssh-keygen –t rsa  You will be asked if you would like to create a passphrase for the keys; this is optional. If you don’t want to create a passphrase, press Enter. This will create two keys in the .ssh directory: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub Change your private key’s permissions. In order to ensure that the private key is only readable by you, enter the command $ chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa   , Once your keys are created, you’re ready to place the public key on the remote computer so that you can connect without a password. Enter the following command, replacing the appropriate parts as explained earlier:   $ scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub <username>@<remote>: Make sure to include the colon (:) at the end of the command. You will be asked to input your password before the file transfer starts.  , Once you’ve placed the key on the remote computer, you will need to install it so that it works correctly. First, log in to the remote computer the same way that you did in Step 3.   Create an SSH folder on the remote computer, if it does not already exist: $ mkdir .ssh  Append your key to the authorized keys file. If the file does not exist yet, it will be created: $ cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys  Change the permissions for the SSH folder to allow access: $ chmod 700 .ssh   , Once the key has been installed on the remote computer, you should be able to initiate a connection without being asked to enter your password. Enter the following command to test the connection: $ ssh <username>@<remote>   If you connect without being prompted for the password, then the keys are configured correctly.

Young puppies learn quickly so take advantage of this to teach basic commands. More complex training can take place from 8 weeks, but keep the sessions short.Keep the session to as many minutes as the puppy is weeks old. Spread the sessions out to 2 or 3 times a day. While it's important to teach the basics, like 'sit', 'down', 'stay' and 'heel,' he should have more obedience training.   If you don't train your Jack Russell from an early age, he will continue fighting to get his own way. They're strong willed dogs that will rule over their owners if not properly trained.; , Take an obedience class with your puppy to teach him canine good citizenship. You'll learn how to properly train your dog and he'll be able to socialize with other dogs and humans in a controlled setting.Training a puppy or dog is a matter of repetition, reward, praise and patience. Never hit, scold, or otherwise negatively discipline a puppy while you are training him.Instead, keep your tone of voice positive since dogs quickly learn to pick up on displeasure in their owner’s voices.  , If you've gotten a Jack Russell Terrier puppy, you'll need to housetrain him. Start by choosing a small room in your house to keep your puppy in when you're not at home. Lay newspaper all over the floor for your puppy to use. Clean the paper every day, until you start noticing your puppy using a preferred spot in the room. Then you can slowly start to get rid of the paper in the areas that your puppy isn't using.Once your puppy is using only a small area of paper, you can move the paper to a place in your house designated as your puppy's place to potty.  , If your dog starts having trouble relieving himself in the appropriate place in the house or outside, retrain your dog. Take him outside every 3 hours and after he eats or naps. Remind your dog that it's time to relieve himself. If he eliminates, give him lots of praise, like ""good boy."" If he doesn't, bring him inside, wait 15 minutes, take him outside and try again.Take your dog to the same spot every time you go outside. This way, your dog will associate the spot with relieving himself.  , Your dog may become anxious when you leave him throughout the day. You may notice your dog scratching, vomiting, urinating inappropriately, pacing, or being aggressive (usually in your absence). Signs of separation anxiety mean your dog depends on you and misses you, rather than being signs of misbehavior.To combat separation anxiety, don't lavish your dog with attention right before you leave the house. Instead, ignore him for 15 to 20 before you leave and for 20 minutes once you return. This will keep his excitement levels low., Chasing can lead to accidents or injuries to either your Jack Russell or the animal he's chasing. To prevent this, make sure your dog sits immediately on command and stays. Or you could desensitize him to cats or other small animals.Desensitizing can also work with other situations. What it takes is patience, consistency, and time to train the puppy to react in a manner which is pleasing to you. You can do this once you have taught the dog a rock solid ""Sit.""  , When the puppy sees the cat and reacts aggressively (lunges, barks, tries to run) tell him sit. When he obeys give him a treat. Let him watch the cat and whenever he acts in an aggressive manner, give the sit command followed by a treat when he complies.   When you feel your puppy is relaxed while watching the cat, you can gradually introduce the cat to the dog (bringing carrier closer, removing the gate) but keep the dog on leash until you feel he will immediately comply with the sit command. This may take several sessions (remember to keep them short) and many days, but eventually he will learn a cat is not to be chased., Offer tiny tasty snacks, like bits of chicken or cheese, to reward your puppy when he obeys your commands. If you're just starting to teach a new command, offer a reward when you notice progress towards performing the task.Offer verbal rewards and praise, like saying, ""good boy,"" or ""yes!"" as well as petting during the training session.   Don’t try to train a puppy when he is hungry, tired, or too energetic. Wait until the puppy is relaxed but still responsive to you.  , Socialization is the process of introducing a puppy to new situations so he learns to interact properly. Introducing your puppy to new situations and people teaches him that the right things (such as other friendly dogs, cats, and people) are not to be feared. Fearful dogs can become “aggressive” if they bite and bark when they cannot run away from the situation.Running away from things that should not be feared can be dangerous. Dogs can run into traffic and get hit by vehicles or run away from home and get lost., Once he's current with vaccinations, you can take him to parks, for walks along busy streets, other dog-friendly places, or enroll him in obedience school. If there are no obedience classes in your area or if you are waiting for one to start up, you can start on basic commands and socialization. You can also take him to crowded areas so he can watch new people and things.You should try exposing your dog to as many different things as possible. For example, take him for a short car ride and stop every once in a while to let him check out his surroundings. Or, invite friends and their pets over to meet your dog. Let him interact with all different types of people and animals.Don't force or rush your dog to socialize. If he's fearful around new animals, don't constantly make him interact. Instead, take it slow and move at a pace that's clearly comfortable for him., If you do, your Jack Russell will learn to be nervous and aggressive with other dogs. Instead, try to keep him on his leash and keep him beside you when other dogs approach. If a stray or aggressive-looking dog comes up, leave the area quickly with your Jack Russell in tow.   On the other hand, Jack Russells can be overly aggressive towards other dogs, even other Jack Russells., Since Jack Russell Terriers are hunting dogs, it's in their nature to be aggressive. You should never leave your dog unattended with another dog, even another Jack Russell Terrier. For this reason, you shouldn't have a Jack Russell Terrier around small children, small animals or pets, or cats.To curb some of your dog's aggression, keep him well exercised and active. Bored Jack Russell Terriers are more likely to be aggressive or destructive.  , Since your Jack Russell may think he's the top dog, let him know that you are the master. For example, after he's learned the sit command, make your Jack Russell sit for his food before you let him eat it. Once in a while, pick up his bowl while he's eating to make sure he knows you're the “top dog.""   Be firm and consistent with him. Don't just let him do whatever he wants., You can take him for a long walk or play active games. Jack Russells are very smart and will keep you hopping unless they can find an outlet for all their pent-up energy. Playing active games such as fetch will help burn off their excessive energy. Terriers love this game.   Jack Russells love when you chase them for the toy. Don't make this a habit, or your dog will learn not to come to you when you call him. Instead, teach him the ""drop it"" command. This way, you're still in charge of the game., These can help burn your Jack Russell's energy. Kongs are great toys because they're almost impossible to tear apart.You can pack them full of peanut butter and treats to keep you Jack Russell busy and working for his snacks.   Generally, stuffed toys aren't great for terriers, even though they love them. Your Jack Russell will probably tear it apart and try to eat it piece by piece leaving your home covered in stuffing.  , Choose a high-quality dog food that isn't filled with grains or preservatives. Instead, look for a dog food that lists meat, such as lamb or chicken, as a top ingredient. Since dog food products vary, follow the specific feeding instructions on the package. You'll probably also need to adjust the amount food you give your Jack Russell Terrier based on his age, activity level, and size.As a general guideline, a 12 inch Jack Russell Terrier should weigh around 12 to 13 pounds.

The difference between the two is as follows:   With open pyometra the cervix is open, which allows some pus drainage from the womb; with closed pyometra the cervix is shut which prevents drainage and means the womb may distend to the point where it ruptures. However the womb can still rupture with open pyometra if the volume of pus produced in the womb exceeds that rate at which it drains away. In this case, sufficient pressure may build up to distend and rupture the womb.; , Pyometra is most likely to occur around 4 to 8 weeks after the end of heat, although it can occur at any stage of a female dog's reproductive cycle. The condition is caused by the influence of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone on the lining of the womb.   Hormonal stimulation causes cystic proliferation of the womb wall and an increased amount of secretions. These secretions may become contaminated by bacteria present in the vagina that ascend into the womb. The combination of increased secretions and the presence of bacteria may lead to a womb infection. The more hormonal stimulation the womb receives in the form of repeated estrous cycles, the greater the likelihood of pyometra developing. Thus, older dogs (over the age of 6 years) are more likely to suffer from pyometra. However, occasionally a young dog is unfortunate and gets pyometra after her first or second season.  , The accumulation of pus inside the womb causes toxicity, and these toxins are absorbed across the lining of the womb and enter the blood stream. This is a form of septicemia and it can cause organ damage and failure.   The signs of pyometra are largely associated with the dog feeling unwell, drinking excessively to try to dilute the toxins in her blood stream, and vomiting. Thus the symptoms include poor appetite, lethargy, and vomiting. In addition, the dog is often very thirsty. If she has an open pyometra she may spend a lot of time licking her vulva and you might see pus staining her bedding. In extreme cases of closed pyometra her belly may become swollen.  , The only guaranteed way of preventing pyometra is to spay the dog. However, a wise precaution that helps to decrease the risk of (but not necessarily prevent) pyometra, is to avoid the use of hormones which postpone heat.   Some breeders with valuable breeding dogs have also toyed with using antibiotics during the dog's heat (more of this in part three) but this is unproven to be beneficial and spaying is a much safer option.  , Spaying is the removal of the dog's ovaries, both horns of the uterus, and the body of the uterus down to the level of the cervix. This is a surgical procedure most often performed via an open laparotomy. This is where the surgeon opens the dog's abdomen under sterile, surgical conditions, to gain access to the structures inside.   This operation is routine surgery which is none-the-less treated with a great deal of respect. There is a small risk of hemorrhage during the operation because the surgeon has to tie off major arteries to the ovaries and the cervix. This risk is minimal in fit, lean dogs because there is minimal intra-abdominal fat and the surgeon can get a good grip for the ligatures. In older, fatter dogs the risk rises because fat cloaking the ovarian pedicles makes the ligatures slightly more likely to slip.  , Spaying your dog has distinct health benefits for her. Not only does it remove the risk of pyometra (as she no longer has a womb to become infected) but if performed before her second season there is also a protective effect against mammary cancer in later life.   That said, a female dog can be spayed at any age, it's just that the benefit against mammary cancer is lost after twp or more seasons. Additionally, the spay operation needs to be timed between estrous cycles so that the surgery occurs when there is less of a blood supply to the womb and the uterine tissue is least friable.  , A female dog usually has two heat seasons a year and each is a huge hormonal event. There is a lead-in period whereby the blood supply to the womb increases, which then tails off after the season.   This increased blood supply makes the tissue more crumbly or friable; this means that the uterine body or horns are more likely to fall apart in the surgeon's hands, causing an increased risk of serious hemorrhage. To avoid this, the ideal time to operate is when the womb is at its most hormonally quiet, which is a window of time that starts about two months after the end of the previous season up to around one month before the start of the next one.  , Hormone injections slightly increase the risk of a dog getting pyometra.   A single injection of delvosteron (see below) increases the chance of pyometra by 0.3%, whilst repeated injections carry an increased incidence of 1.4%. Whilst avoiding hormone injections is not a true ""prevention"", by avoiding them it removes a risk factor for pyometra development., Hormone injections were once used more frequently than they now are, to prevent a female dog coming into heat at an inconvenient time.   However, greater knowledge about the risks of inducing diseases like pyometra, mammary cancer, and conditions such as diabetes mellitus has led to a fall in their use. The most commonly used hormone to postpone heat is Delvosterone, which contains proligestone – a synthetic progestin. The latter is a hormone associated with pregnancy, so the injection fools the body into thinking the dog is pregnant, and hence she doesn't come into heat. Each injection works for around 4-6 months.  , This is an unproven method of preventing pyometra that has not undergone scientific trials and the results of which are largely anecdotal.   Breeders with valuable stud animals are keen to reduce the risk of pyometra any way they can because they do not want their stock animals neutered. The theory behind antibiotic use is to put the dog onto long courses of antibiotics during her season. This is because the cervix is open during estrous, so there is a theoretical increased risk of bacteria ascending up into the womb. However, the presence of bacteria is only one factor in the development of pyometra, because significant thickening of the womb wall and increased glandular secretions must take place for the bacteria to colonize. Taking antibiotic does nothing to influence the anatomical changes taking part in the womb as a result of hormonal stimulation.

Make sure the two characters are compatible mates and not just two characters that you think who have cute children. If your chosen fandom lacks compatible males or females, you may need to add an OC.   It's okay for more than one character to be pregnant. For plot twists, try out ""pregnancy confusion"". Perhaps pregnancy tests were mixed up, and some girls think they're pregnant when they are actually not, and the girls who actually pregnant are wondering what's happening. Maybe one girl is faking because she wants her boyfriend to not dump her (but handle this scenario with caution, as this is considered abuse in real life).; , How will the mother feel when she finds out? How will the father feel? Does she even know who the father is? Will being pregnant keep her from doing her job? How will this affect the lives of others? You may want to make a chart of all possible effects of her pregnancy.  , In many fanfictions, the girl wakes up one day and suddenly she's pregnant. Any fanfiction written like this makes it sound like the author never passed health class (if you haven't studied this in health class, then you probably are too young to write one of these). There are typically four ways for your character to get pregnant:   She's in a committed relationship and they have been trying for a while. She had a one night stand, and/or her birth control failed. She has a disease or condition that caused her to have a low fertility rate and didn't see birth control as being necessary. She was raped. However, if your character was impregnated by rape, put a warning at the beginning of the fanfiction that your story contains rape or rape mentions. In other fanfictions, the character can get pregnant through magical means. Make sure this makes sense for the story, though - a character getting pregnant in Harry Potter through magical means is more realistic than in Warriors, for example.  , Does she take a pregnancy test? Does her doctor tell her? Does she miss her period? Is she wounded in battle and the medics find out while using their equipment to check her wounds?   The ""morning sickness"" method (where the pregnant character throws up in the morning and then ponders over the cause of it) is an ""easy out"" for many, but in real life, not all pregnant people experience morning sickness. This tactic in stories is also extremely overused and gives away your character's pregnancy for many readers. If you want the pregnancy to be a surprise to the story, avoid the ""morning sickness"" giveaway.  , Chances are, if you're writing a pregnancy fanfiction, you have never given birth, so it's important to put in as much research into this, as you would a school project. Research the basics of pregnancy, the effects of pregnancy on the body and mind, possible complications (if you want to write a complication), and how one needs to care for their pregnancy to keep the baby healthy.   Research the effects of pregnancy after the parent has given birth, too. Nobody loses all their baby weight right when they give birth, and if you want your fanfiction to be accurate, you'll need to learn about what people would do to care for babies after birth in that time period, too. Be aware that some descriptions of pregnancy and childbirth can be quite disgusting. Prepare yourself!  ,   Is she ready for a baby? How does pregnancy affect her, aside from just the baby bump? (Morning sickness? Hormones? Strange food cravings?) What does she look like in all three trimesters? Does she have any trouble giving birth?  , This will be especially important if you intend to write sequels where the child is older. Decide on the basics of the child - what do they look like? What's their assigned sex? Do they have any problems during the birth?   Make sure that the child resembles the parents, but is not a 50/50 mixture of their traits. Genetics are complex; two people with brown hair can have a blonde child, and a family of tall people can produce a short child. Similarly, don't base the child's personality off of a mixture of the parents'. It's true that many traits can be passed from parent to child, but make sure you're giving the child plenty of qualities that are unique to the child. If you're dealing with characters who have powers, you could go in a lot of directions. Maybe the child inherits a parent's powers, only weaker. Or because they're half human, the powers don't show up at all. If your character is half-human or otherwise multiple species, how will they take on traits of either species?  , Many aspiring fanfiction writers try to make their story different from other pregnancy fanfictions out there. Be wary not to make any of these scenarios turn into a pitfall of your story.  Take care when writing a ""male pregnancy"" plotline. Usually, male pregnancy stories involve a cisgender man getting pregnant and they have no clue how. However, this can disappoint a lot of readers, since it's considered lazy writing. Give the character a reason for their pregnancy (such as alien abduction) and an explanation as to how they've gotten pregnant (a rare genetic mutation).  Not all men are cisgender, and a transgender man could actually get pregnant if he hasn't undergone surgery to remove his female reproductive system. However, if you choose to write a transgender character for a male pregnancy story, be very cautious to research transgender identity so you don't portray transgender people inaccurately. Do not make an intersex character for the sake of a male pregnancy, as this is not only inaccurate, but can be offensive - especially if you use insensitive terms to refer to intersex people.    Be sensitive with disability and birth defects. It can seem like a good way to give the story a plot twist, especially in future sequels, but if you write it poorly, you may upset readers - whether it's because of the accuracy issues or because they're disabled themselves. Dramatic birth scenes may intrigue readers, but they can also be written terribly and disappoint readers. Don't try and make the scene too interesting, or it'll fall flat on its face. Very few birth stories involve ten complications at once.  ,, They will make sure your story sounds good and fix all the errors.  ,",1107,"['character', 'lives', 'research', 'story', 'offspring', 'story online', 'certain scenarios', 'others', 'baby', 'beta reader', 'pregnant character', 'pregnancy', 'beginning', 'father', 'end', 'characters']"

If you have questions, now is the time to ask. Don’t sign the conditions if there is something that you are unsure about or don’t understand. Be clear about your responsibilities under these conditions., Different states may refer to the types of probation differently, but the general categories are usually similar. Some probation requires very close supervision by a probation officer, but other types of probation simply require you to stay out of further legal trouble.   Supervised probation requires that you remain under the supervision of a probation officer, who makes sure that you comply with a list of terms and conditions. Unsupervised probation requires only that you stay out of trouble, pay any fines or restitution that is ordered, and perhaps attend court-ordered counseling or an alcohol awareness class. If you complete these simple requirements, you are released from probation after its term has expired. Intensive probation may require a higher level of supervision and some sort of intensive inpatient or outpatient treatment, depending on your circumstances.  , Your probation conditions typically require you to meet with your probation officer fairly quickly following your sentencing for the crime that you have committed. Appear promptly for that appointment and start taking the steps necessary to comply with your probation conditions., If you violate the terms and conditions of your probation, your probation officer has the authority to file a probation revocation. This type of motion details how you have violated the conditions of your probation asks the court to issue a warrant for your arrest and place you in jail.When you are placed on probation, you are given a jail sentence that is suspended, meaning that you do not have to serve it. The jail sentence is suspended on the condition that you comply with your probation conditions. If you violate your probation conditions, you likely will have to serve some or all of the suspended portion of your sentence. This means that you will be incarcerated, most likely with no bond, and may even be sent to prison. Your probation officer and the prosecutor handling your case will be asked to make a recommendation to the court about how much of your suspended jail sentence you should serve as a result of having violated your probation. Ultimately, the judge will decide how much time in jail you will have to serve due to a probation revocation. The judge is not required to order what the probation officer or prosecutor recommends, but only what he or she believes is reasonable and fair under the law.  , Most people who are placed on probation are ordered to pay certain fees, fines, and costs. These might include court costs, probation fees, drug testing expenses, and restitution to the victim, in some cases. For instance, if you write a bad check, you may be ordered to pay restitution to the business to whom you wrote the check, in order to make up for its financial loss. Make sure you pay them in full and on time. Everyone runs out of money, so if you're unable to pay, at least try to pay a little toward them as often as you can. Late and/or unpaid fines can technically result in a revocation of your probation, meaning that you could be arrested and sent to jail.  , You will need to meet with your probation officer on a regular basis, on whatever schedule he or she sets. At these appointments, the probation officer will question you about your recent activities, including whether you are working, and payment of your fines. Always keep your address and phone number updated with your probation officer. Your probation officer may check with other agencies or your employer to ensure that you are doing what you are supposed to be doing. Failure to keep these appointments can result in the revocation of your probation.  , If you are not working, your probation conditions often will require you to complete a certain amount of community service each week. If you are working a full-time job, you typically will not be required to complete community service. However, if you aren’t working, you often will have to complete 30 or more hours per week of community service.   Most court systems have their own community service program in which you can participate. If you live outside of the immediate community and have transportation difficulties, your probation officer may approve of you completing community service at an eligible non-profit organization or similar agency that is close to your home.  , Your conditions of probation most likely will require you to obtain and maintain employment. Your probation officer wants to know that you are working and that you're a productive member of society. Some require proof of your employment, such as a pay stub. Working also will help you to pay your fees on time.  , If you commit a new crime when you already on probation, you will not only face the penalties for that crime, but also a revocation of your probation. Committing a crime while on probation is an aggravating circumstance that can cause the judge to give you a harsher sentence.   Remember, the judge doesn't want to earn a reputation as being overly ""soft"" on crime. If you commit a crime while on probation, you will give the judge the chance to prove how ""hard"" on crime he/she can be. Judges are much harsher on criminals who continue to break the law while on probation  , It is likely that your probation conditions will provide for random drug testing by your probation officer. Particularly if your crime involved drugs in any way, your probation officer may test you for drugs at any of your appointments or at any other time that he or she designates. If a drug test reveals that you are using drugs, you are subject to a probation revocation.  , In many cases, you may have to request permission from your probation officer to travel out of state or even out of county. Make sure that you appropriately request permission to travel if necessary.  , Other probation conditions may include keeping your address and phone number updated with your probation officer and reporting all employment to your probation officer. If your crime involved alcohol in any way, you also may be ordered to refrain from consuming alcohol., While your conditions of probation may be difficult, you don’t have much choice but to comply with them, unless you would rather be incarcerated. Try to focus on the positive, like the fact that you are able to live at home with your family and find employment rather than sit in jail., Your attitude towards your probation officer(PO) and others will make the difference between successfully completing probation and finding more trouble with the law.  , If your friends and family members are placing pressure on you and contributing to you breaking the law, you need to stop seeing them. Make the necessary changes to your environment so that you can stay out of court and out of jail.  , You may be placed on probation for six months, one year, or even multiple years. If, at the end of your probation period, you still are not in compliance with certain terms and conditions of your probation, your probation officer may request that your probation period be extended., Sometimes, after completing a certain period of probation, you may need a change in your probation conditions, for instance, in order to accommodate a new job. For instance, suppose that you take a job that requires you to travel over the state line, which is almost 15 miles away. Your probation conditions do not permit you to travel out of state. You may need to request that the court modify the conditions of your probation to allow you to take this new job, if you can show that it would be in your best interest.",1343,"['job', 'probation', 'travel restrictions', 'terms', 'others', 'appointments', 'consequences', 'position', 'fees', 'crime', 'complete community service', 'conditions', 'probation conditions', 'length', 'modification', 'good attitude', 'type', 'illegal drugs']"
"['find a quiet place to train your dog', 'teach the dog to watch you', 'choose a release cue such as ""okay""', '""free""', 'or ""break"" to communicate to the dog that it\'s okay to break heel position or get up from a sit.', 'teach your dog proper positioning', 'teach your dog to position itself correctly', ""get your dog's attention"", 'with your dog in position', 'take one step', 'once your dog is reliably heeling', 'introduce speed changes and turns', 'heavily reinforce your dog for good behavior with whatever they enjoy most - treats', 'play', 'petting', 'praise', 'etc', 'use corrections with care', 'think of the leash as an extension of your arm', 'when you praise your dog', 'do not let it disobey your command until you release it', 'reinforce that your dog cannot forge ahead', 'train your dog not to lag as well', 'try placing your thumb in your pocket to secure the lead at a length you feel comfortable working with', 'use a thick collar']",How to Teach Your Dog to Heel," You want to eliminate distractions, so that your dog can concentrate on you easily. If you have a backyard, that is the perfect place to train your dog. Otherwise, find a quiet corner of a park with few other people or pets. If outdoors is too distracting, start inside. Gradually increase the amount of distraction as the dog learns, and be sure to practice in different places, so that the dog understands that ""heel"" means ""heel"" everywhere, not just in the backyard.; , This can be accomplished by simply associating a cue such as ""Watch me"" with a treat. Your dog will quickly learn to look at you when you use the word, as they will expect a treat. Once this has been accomplished, give treats randomly, not necessarily for every occasion, but don't stop completely.   Don't rely on the leash to physically move the dog. The leash is for safety, not a means of communication. Practicing off-leash in a safe location is ideal.  ,, The proper way to walk a dog is with the dog on your left side. However, this is only necessary for formal obedience and some other sports. For pet dogs, choose whichever side is best for you, but be consistent and stick with the chosen side.   The dog should walk with its head or shoulder even with your hip. You are not holding the leash tight to keep your dog in place. The leash is slack between you, with no contact.  , ""Right Here"" is a useful command to teach your dog when standing. If your dog is not close enough or is confused about which side to sit at, slap your hip and use the command ""Right Here"". If needed, lure your dog to your side with a treat. As your dog learns, slowly fade the lure by using your hand without a treat, then just your hand, then more general. The lure can become a hand signal (moving your hand to your hip).  , The key to heeling is having your dog's attention. Start standing still with your dog sitting beside you in the correct position. Get your dogs attention by calling its name, tapping on its head, making noises, or using your pre-taught ""watch me"" cue.   When the dog looks up, slap your left hip with your hand and say ""Right Here"". This is a command. Your dog can learn to look where you indicate, and in this way you are giving your dog a reference point for where he should be while heeling. Set your dog up for success. Try your best to avoid asking for more than your dog is capable of. Remember, the key is getting your dog's attention. This can be the most difficult thing. Also, though it takes some work, while getting your dog's attention you can teach your dog to look at you when you say ""Watch me"" or whatever your chosen cue is. Remember to reward with a treat when your dog responds correctly.  , Reward your dog. Increase to two, then three, and so on.  ,   Consider every walk you have with the dog a training session., Treats are usually the most favoured and easiest option. You should positively reinforce your dog when he obeys your commands correctly. Avoid using punishment to train.  , Many people train their dogs with all positive, reward-based methods, which require a lot of patience and consistency. Corrections can get quicker results sometimes, but it can also backfire by damaging your relationship with your dog, creating anxiety and confusion in the dog, and resulting in more unwanted behavior.  , With this in mind, do not correct your dog unless he or she needs correction. Giving mixed signals to your dog will only complicate and inhibit successful training.   Keeping the leash slack (not correcting constantly) means that when you actually do pull on the leash, your dog is much more likely to listen to you.  , For instance, if you tell your dog to sit, it obeys, you praise it, and it gets up, immediately stop the praise. If your dog does not sit down again by itself after a few seconds, firmly put it into place, then praise again.   You do not need to repeat the command. Enforcing it is much more effective. You may want to give the dog another chance to obey properly.  , Most dogs forge ahead. To correct this, keep your dog on a leash that is tight enough to allow you to step across in front of him. When he tries to forge ahead, turn sharply and step directly in his path, making a 90 degree turn and heading off in a new direction. Once again, turn sharply, as if walking along a square.   The dog will be used to leading you, and may be surprised or confused. Walk in a straight line again, until the dog tries to forge past you. Pull the same stunt. Doing this for 5-15 minutes a day is enough. Some dogs learn after the first session, but some dogs who have been used to leading you for years may take longer.  , Most dogs lag consistently if they feel afraid, neglected, unwanted, or abused but many dogs lag occasionally if they are sidetracked by smells or activities. The way to stop lagging is similar to stopping forging. All you have to do is let the leash hit your leg every time you step as you walk.   Your leash should once again be in your right hand, and a lagging dog would be on your left side behind you, with the leash crossing in front of your legs. This will cause a jerk when you step forward with your left leg, and if this isn't enough to make your dog want to catch up, you can slowly reel in the leash while your leg is bumping it. You should use a command while doing this ""Get-Up-Here"" and/or ""Right Here""; with your left hand slap your hip. Speak this command, and your dog's name, using ""Hey"" to get his attention if needed. Once your dog is next to you, praise and let the leash slack. Most likely he will lag again, but all you have to do is repeat., The abrupt stop or changes in direction at the consistent lead tension seem to direct the dog well. Sometimes with your hands free you can tend to allow too much slack allowing the dog to roam while you daydream. The thumb trick keeps them firmly in place.  , Thinner collars are more severe than wider collars, as pressure is not displaced over a larger area, making corrections more severe.

Filming a movie is not easy, and you need to assume that anything that can go wrong will. Actors get sick, weather doesn't cooperate, and there are 100's of little decisions (lighting, character placement, costumes) that need to be made every hour. The only way to have a successful shoot is to do as much work as you can before you even start.   Review the day's shot list. What do you need to get, and what can you cut if you run out of time? Rehearse with the actors. Make sure they know their lines and how you want them played. Review lighting and camera choices with the DP., Give everyone the details in a straightforward manner right from the top. This is especially important for low-budget films, as you will usually be getting some acting and work for free. Let the cast and crew know your goals for the day's shoot and how thankful they are for your support.   Give out the day's schedule in advance so everyone is prepared. Let the crew know about any special effects or moods you are going for and how they can help create them. Review your shooting procedure so that everyone knows their role.  , Blocking is where the actors are, and where they go. This is the first step to any filming, and the most essential -- all the lights, cameras, and sound cannot be placed until after it is done. If the scene is well rehearsed this should be easy. If not, you'll need to spend some time placing the actors in the right spots.   Keep this as simple as possible-- walking in straight lines, basic entrances and exits, and mostly still positions. It is not a play and the cameras will only capture a small fraction of the entire scene. Let the camera do the movement whenever possible, not the actors.Tape can be placed on the floor to tell the actors where to end up after every shot. You can often pre-plan using crew-members or a detailed shot list to save time. If you have the blocking already written out, your shoot will be much more productive.  , There are an infinite number of ways to place, move, and use your cameras. This is why a shot-list, which is basically a list of your prearranged camera positions, is vital to save time and money. In the interest of time, the three essential camera angles in a scene of dialog are:    Establishing shots, or masters: Establishing shots contain all the action of the scene -- the speaking characters, the set, and the movements. They are long, wide shots that, if anything went wrong, you could use to film the entire scene, as they capture everything.  2-shot (2-cameras): One camera over each actors shoulder, pointing at the other actor. This way you get to look at each character as they talk. When filming 3 or more actors, try and block it out so that you have 2 characters in the frame at once -- this way you only need one camera to capture their dialog. Watch some of your favorite movies with a discerning eye. How, for example, would a movie capture a dinner date between 2 people? You'll notice these three camera angles (one of both of them + the table, one of the guy, one of the girl) more than any other set of shots.  , Remember, it is always better to have more light than to have less. It is easy to darken an image in post-production, but it is very hard to make it lighter without sacrificing image quality. Use natural light to your advantage whenever possible and, above all, keep it simple. Your goal is a nice, gradual range of lights -- deep, dark shadows and very few big bright spots.   Put your camera in black and white to see just the lightness of the image. If it is still an interesting shot in black and white, it will look incredible in color. The hour and a half around sunrise and sunset is considered the best time to shoot in natural light. The lighting is soft and even, and you can even use this time to illuminate ""nighttime"" shots, which are dimmed later on in post-production.Use ""practicals,"" or in-scene lights. Having trouble getting the light right? Stick a lamp in the shot, or turn on the ceiling lights., The techniques for beginning a film will vary from set to set, but they should not vary from shot to shot. Having a routine before you start filming ensures that everyone is on the same page, every time. When possible, this is the AD's duty. A sample routine would include:   ""Everyone this is picture, quiet please!"" ""Roll sound!"" This is the cue to start microphones. When done, someone yells, ""Rolling!"" ""Roll Picture!"" This is the cue to start cameras. When done, someone yells, typically, ""Speed!"" Read off the title, scene, and take number, ""This is My Movie, Scene 1, Take 2."" If you have a clapboard, it is slapped and someone shouts ""Marker!"" 3-5 seconds of silence. ""ACTION!"", Pick a few extreme angles, interesting shots of the environment, or close-ups of character's faces, hands, or props and run the scene again. These shots may only last for 1-2 seconds in the movie, but they are essential for editing. Look at any movie and notice how many small, seemingly useless shots are used to get into the world of the scene, show an emotional twitch, or simply transition from scene to scene. Film these shots once the actors have delivered their lines to your liking.Do the characters talk about the cake on the table? Then you need a shot of just the cake on the table. Do you need to show what time it is? Then you need a shot of the clock on the wall., You may need to make some sacrifices depending on your budget and time, but even Hollywood directors are forced to do this. After every day, make sure you have everything you want and need, then cross it off your shot list. You need to know now, not 3 months later as you start editing, if something is missing.  , B-roll is simply the shots that don't include actors. It is usually used in transitions, opening or closing credits, or setting up a new location. Head out with a camera and you DP and get as many hours of footage as you can. You primary goal is to think about footage that may compliment the film. For example, the B-Roll in Punch-Drunk Love is a series of abstract, multi-colored shots that match the protagonist's confused, anxious, and crippled mental state. Spy movies usually have a lot of B-Roll of gorgeous beaches, bustling cities, and dramatic landscapes. B-roll tells your story subtly and visually.   You can never have enough B-roll. When you're editing, this is the connective tissue that holds your scenes together to make a legitimate movie. You can, and should, shoot B-roll before and after a scene ""ends,"" as these 2-3 seconds are a great way to bring the audience into the scene slowly., At the end of shooting take the time to pull your footage off memory cards and download it to a secure hard drive. This small step at the end of the day can save you hours and hours of time in the unfortunate case that you lose your footage.   Most professionals use more than one backup, copying all the footage to at least two sources before erasing anything on the memory cards. Take this time to organize your footage as well. Make a folder for the day you shot, then organize the footage in that folder by scene. This will make shooting much, much easier.

Both black and bright red stool could be an indicator of bleeding somewhere in the intestines, or from something more minor like hemorrhoids.Bleeding from the small intestines usually produces melena, or black, tarry stools. Bleeding that originates in lower gastrointestinal tract (such as bleeding from hemorrhoids) usually results in bright red blood. There are other minor factors like diet and medications that could color stools black and red, but if you are concerned, it’s always best to talk to your healthcare provider.; , Bile contributes to the coloring of stool, so this lack of color could actually indicate the absence of bile. This could mean there’s something blocking a bile duct, which could potentially be an indicator for a serious medical problem. If you ever notice white or light colored stools, make sure you talk to your doctor right away.White stools to usually result from steatorrhea (excretions of fat) which can may indicate pancreatic issues.  , While stool colors can range from browns to yellows to greens and still be considered “normal” and healthy, a medium brown color is the most common in healthy stool. It should be about the same color as a chocolate bar.Stool turns brown through a complicated process in the digestive tract. Basically, the color comes from the protein hemoglobin being broken down to create bilirubin in the liver.  , Food coloring, leafy vegetables, and even beets can tint stool different colors. This is normal. For example, eating leafy green veggies like kale or spinach could give your stool a green color, and eating beets could potentially turn stool a reddish color. This shouldn’t be cause for alarm, especially if you’ve recently eaten these foods.Only rarely is red stool a serious indicator of an issue in the intestine. Even bright red stool could simply be caused by bleeding from minor and common conditions like hemorrhoids.  , If you notice your stool is yellow in color (steatorrhea), this could be a sign of a lack of fat absorption in your digestive track. There are many things that could cause problems with absorbing fats, so if this yellow stool persists for more than two days, give your doctor a call.Yellow stool that is also especially smelly or greasy could also be a sign of a problem with or allergy to gluten. Your doctor can confirm whether or not this is the cause., Many medications, from vitamin supplements to anti-diarrheal medications to prescription medications, can cause changes in stool color. These color changes are normal when associated with the use of those medications, so make sure to read the warning or side effects label on anything you take on a regular basis.Iron supplements could potentially turn your stool green or black, while bismuth subsalicylate (the anti-diarrheal found in Pepto Bismol) can also turn stool black.  , In the first few days after birth, it’s completely normal for some black stool to show up in your baby’s diaper. This will pass within 2-4 days, after the baby has gotten all of the meconium out of its body. It will likely transition into an earthy green color after that, and it will stay a mushy consistency.Your baby’s poop while breastfeeding will likely be mushy, and either a green or yellow color. This is normal. Formula-fed babies will probably have mushy stool that is more brown than babies that are breastfed, but this is perfectly normal as well.  , Even though these colorations could be caused by dietary changes or medications, these colors could also be indicators of blood in the intestinal tract. If you have blood in your stool, or are actively bleeding when you have a bowel movement, seek medical attention as soon as possible.If your stool is bright red or black and you recently ingested anti-diarrheal medications, food with red dye in it, or started a new medication, make an appointment with your doctor to make sure the change in your stool color isn’t indicating anything more serious. Your doctor will run various tests on your stool like a fecal occult blood test to determine the cause.  , Most of the time, changes in stool color can be explained by treatable conditions, or simply by dietary causes. It’s unlikely that a change in your stool color is cause for a trip to the emergency room, or even for any panic.Always check for recent changes in your diet or side effects of medications if your stool color changes suddenly.  , Regardless of the cause, if you are concerned about your stool or changes in your digestion, your safest and most effective method of treatment should be to seek advice from your doctor. A doctor will be able to identify for certain if there is anything to worry about, or if what you’re dealing with is normal.Even if it might feel embarrassing or make you feel anxious to talk about your bowel movements, it’s important to bring them up with your doctor if you are concerned. It’s always better to play it safe and get a medical opinion.  , If the change in color is associated with abdominal pain or sudden diarrhea, for example, it could be a sign of something more than just a dietary change. If your stool color change is associated with any other sudden symptoms, see your doctor.   Black or red diarrhea, for example, could be a sign of a serious condition and should be addressed immediately., By keeping yourself well hydrated, you can help the process of digestion happen smoothly and easily. Water can help soften stool and help you avoid issues like constipation. It can also help you absorb certain nutrients more efficiently from the food you take in.Try keeping a water bottle with you at all times. Refill it whenever you finish it, and try to drink around 1 to 2 liters (0.3 to 0.5 US gal) of fluids every day., A healthy diet isn’t just defined by what you eat, but also by how often and how quickly you eat it. In order to make sure your digestion takes place as smoothly as possible, try to eat slowly. Don’t rush and eat too quickly. This can potentially cause stomach upset. Try to eat smaller meals throughout the day rather than overeating in one sitting.Naturally, what you eat does matter! Try foods with high fiber content, like fruits and vegetables. Try to make half of your plate vegetables at every meal. Also, try your best to lower or limit your intake of things like processed foods, and alcohol., Maintaining a regular exercise routine can promote overall health. In terms of your digestive health specifically, exercise can actually help strengthen the muscles in your abdomen and trigger the digestive process. Try fitting in a brisk walk or light jog at least a few times a week.You can also fit exercise into your everyday routine by taking simple steps such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or picking the far parking spot rather than the one right by the door. Try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five days a week, or 150 minutes total.  , Stress can wreak havoc on your body, and really do a number on your digestive process. Stress can cause constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and even loss of appetite. If you have high stress levels, try to find a de-stressing method that works for you, like daily meditation, or eliminating unnecessary triggers of stress.",1253,"['certain foods', 'doctor', 'brown poop', 'stool color', 'serious medical condition', 'light-colored stool', 'healthy diet', 'fat', 'mind', 'rarity', 'foods', 'medications', 'change', 'yellow stool', 'newborns', 'black stool', 'physical symptoms', 'medical attention', 'black stools', 'tarry stools', 'stress levels']"

You should feel at ease before starting yoga meditation. If the location is noisy, an advanced yoga practitioner may be able to deal with external influences, but beginners will find it distracting.   Ideal locations are either free from technology and machinery, or otherwise block the sounds our mind must make effort to filter out. Somewhere with a lot of natural light through windows is preferred over flickering electrical lighting.; , Aside from the sounds they produce being a distraction, the machines that produce our heating and cooling are not as naturally pleasing to the body as a cool breeze or the warm sun. If yoga meditation in the outdoors is not a viable option, choose somewhere with radiant heat like a wood fire or hydronic heat. Create a cross-flow by opening a door or a window, so fresh oxygen is pumped into the location.   Accentuate the location by selecting a location with minimal synthetic material. Wood floors with natural oils and waxes have less static electricity, and are conducive to yoga meditation. If you live in a high pollution area, performing yoga meditation inside may actually be preferable. Studios where large classes practice yoga can become stuffy, building up carbon dioxide and lessening the available oxygen. A yoga mat can be used for added comfort.  , If you have a full stomach, you could relax so much you’ll feel drowsy. And if you time it too close to meal time, the hunger pains could be too distracting. Attempt to schedule your meditation when you are comfortable, perhaps a few hours after a meal.An alternative would be to eat a light snack before mealtime and then meditate.  , With a brief warm-up, your body will be more limber, relaxed, and able to better focus on meditation. You’ll also likely be able to sit for longer periods of time if you’re more limber.Focus on your core and back for just a few minutes, with various, light twists and bends.A few of the following Sukshma Yoga exercises can also be very beneficial:   Use two fingers to lightly squeeze the eyebrow several times. Roll your eyes in circles several times. Rub your temples and jawline. Grab your ears and pull downward softly., You can sit anywhere that allows good posture, like the floor or a chair. Try not to be too rigid. Crossing legs like you see in many pictures about yoga meditation is not necessary, but if you sit that way, alternate which leg is on top each time you meditate.Being comfortable is critical when trying to focus on meditation. Pull your chin slightly back to aid in the spine alignment.  , Breathing deeply is a great way to prepare for a meditation session. Focusing on breathing helps ease the body and mind, as well as improve focus. One particular breathing method called the Nadi Shodhan Pranayama – a subtle breathing technique – involves alternating nostrils in the manner below:Place the index and middle finger of your right hand between your eyes, and the remaining fingers around your nose. The thumb will be on your right nostril. Breathe deeply into the left nostril while closing the right nostril. Alternate pressure, and exhale out of the right nostril., The Samasthiti is a pose that is similar to the traditionally military standing at attention. It's about being attentive to your own balance, your own steadiness. From there, place your palms together - also called Anjali Mudra - in what many recognize as praying. Breathe in while raising your hands over your head, and exhale as you return them back to your chest.Perform this step for a minute or two in order to really settle yourself.  , Get on your hands and knees, with your palms under your shoulders for weight support. Inhale deeply as you raise your head and upper body. Simultaneously lower your spine towards the floor. It should feel like your spine is getting closer to your stomach as this pose is being done. Complete the pose by returning back to an aligned back while exhaling., In a sitting position, place your hands on your sides and bring your left foot up to contact your left buttock. Repeat the process with the right foot. At this point you'll be in a squatting position, and you'll be easily able to lean forward and shift your weight to your knees. Sit back on the space between your heels. Breathe normally for a few minutes in this position.At the end of this position, your toes should be touching. Be sure to keep your core tightened to promote the good posture. An upright posture is easier with the vajrasana because the pose promotes straightness with minimal effort.  , The Ujjayi breath is long and smooth. It is good for both giving you energy and making you feel calm.  Sit cross-legged on the floor. Try to relax. Imagine that you are taking long, slow breaths inward through a straw. Exhale slowly, as though through the same straw. Make the breath as long and as smooth as possible., Your everyday life has several distractions and worries. For the first part of your yoga meditation, allow yourself to embrace the various things going on in your life. Acknowledge your own personal chaos. By recognizing the many distractions in your life, it allows you to more easily remove yourself of exterior distractions when you begin to focus., Direct your attention inside, to the base of your spine. Slowly, pull your attention up through the center of your body along the spinal column, and move through each part of the body. Take inventory of each body part as you move along.   Be aware of your various senses (i.e. taste, smell, sight). Acknowledge thoughts, emotions, and your progression towards acceptance. Think about how your various body parts are functioning with one another. Notice if you have any tension or pain.  , In order to attain a higher level of concentration while meditating, the mind must gradually become silenced during reflection. The ability to set your mind at ease is not possible if the body and breath are not focused. To help become aware of your mind, follow what is called the “Four Functions of Mind”:   Observe your mind and its impressions, ego, judgments, and discriminations. Accept the various observations for what they are, whether positive or negative. Understand how your train of thought flows from one thing to the next. Train your mind to choose the object of focus, rather than allowing consciousness to flow between items., The point is to embrace the current moment. If you’re beginning, your attention will falter. Redirect your attention as best you can back to the object, and you’ll be able to ignore more distractions as you get better at meditating. Try focusing on something like one of the following items:   A dot on a sheet of paper. The center point of tile. The design in a floorboard.  , At the end of your meditation, bring your attention back to your body by making a small movement while opening your eyes. Become aware of any change you may feel inside your body, or any shift in your attention.Try one of the following techniques to help end the yoga meditation sessions:   Lightly ball your fists a few times. Flex your calf muscles. Smiling is a good way to focus muscles, and it has the added benefit of enhancing meditation.",1241,"['natural heat', 'spot', 'ujjayi breathing', 'upright', 'quiet environment', 'meditation sessions', 'mind', 'samasthiti', 'vajrasana', 'distractions', 'meals', 'fresh air', 'body', 'cow', 'singular object', 'eyes', 'practice deep breathing techniques']"

The exposure is controlled by the camera's light meter. The light meter determines what the proper exposure is; it all sets the f-stop and shutter speed. The f-stop is a fraction; the f represents the focal length. The f-stop is determined by dividing the focal length by the aperture. f/2.8 would be 1/2.8 versus f/16 which would be 1/16. If you look at it like slices of a pie, you would get a lot more pie with 1/2.8 than you would with 1/16. This can be very unnerving, but f-stops and shutter speeds on every picture to get the light right or the lightness and darkness and exposure. A good way to understand it is to ""think of a bucket of water with a hole in the bottom. If you have a large hole in the bottom of the bucket (large aperture), water will drain out quickly (fast shutter speed). Conversely, for the same amount of water, if you have a small hole in the bottom of the bucket (small aperture), the water will drain out slowly (slow shutter speed).""  Exposure or lightness and darkness in the picture is a combination of the f-stop, which is the size of the hole in the lens, and the shutter speed, which is the length of time that the shutter is open. So, if you leave the shutter open longer, you're getting more light to the film or more light to the digital sensor, and the picture gets brighter, or lighter. If you shorten the exposure (give less light to the film or to the digital sensor), the exposure gets darker. Longer shutter speed: more exposure, more light; shorter shutter speed: less exposure, less light.; , ""F-stop"" (also called ""f-number"") means fraction and the f-number is the fraction of the actual opening in the lens compared to the focal length of the lens. The aperture is the opening light passes through.  , Suppose that you have a lens with a focal length of 50mm and the f-number is f/1.8. The f-number is determined by focal length/aperture. So 50/x=1.8 or x~=28. The actual diameter where the light comes through the lens is 28mm across. If that lens had an f-stop of 1, for example, the aperture would be 50mm, because 50/1=50. That's what the f-stop actually means.  , In the manual mode you can set both the f-stop and shutter speed. If you really want to control the light, the exposure, and how the picture works, you need to learn to know how to use the manual exposure mode; it's not just for the propeller heads and the guys who still shoot film! Manual mode is still viable today even with digital because it's really how you control the look and feel of your picture.  , The aperture is really important to control the picture; it lets in the light, and the light is the most important thing for your picture. Without light, you won't have a picture.   Set the aperture to control both the light and the amount that is in focus, in other words, the depth of field. Set a wide opening, like f/2 or 2.8, to blur the background and have your subject razor sharp. Also, you'll probably want to use the largest aperture when shooting in low-light, in order to prevent blur. Shoot a medium aperture, 5.6 or 8 so the subject is sharp and background is slightly out of focus but still recognizable. Shoot at smaller apertures, like f/11 and possibly smaller, for a landscape picture when you want the flowers in the foreground, the river, and the mountains all in focus. Depending on your format, tiny apertures like f/16 and smaller will cause you to lose sharpness due to diffraction effects. For many photographers, the aperture is far more important to achieving great pictures than the shutter speed, because it controls the depth of field of the picture, whereas it's more difficult to tell if a picture was shot at 1/250 or 1/1000 of a second.  , You change the ISO on your digital camera to control the camera's sensitivity to light. In bright light, we set the camera to be less sensitive, to give us a picture with less noise since the shutter speed is fast enough at 100 ISO. In low light where there's less ambient light, you need more sensitivity in the camera. Therefore, raise the ISO from 100 to possibly 1600 or even 6400 if you have to, to get enough light in so that the picture isn't blurry. Now, what's the payback? As you raise the ISO, you get more noise (the film equivalent being grain) in the picture and less color, so be sure to set the ISO as low as possible without having the ISO too low that you end up with blurry pictures.  , The ISO on your digital camera is just like it is on film. You used to buy the film by the kind of light you were using. Today, you set the ISO on your camera depending on the light.   How do you set it? On some cameras there's a button right on the top of the camera that says ISO. You press the button, turn the dial, and change it. Some cameras you have to go into the menu and find the ISO setting. Click on the ISO setting and turn the dial and change it. That's how you set the ISO on your digital camera.  , Change the shutter speed on your camera to affect the action-stopping ability. If you're shooting a picture with your camera hand-held, you will need a shutter speed that as fast as or faster than the reciprocal of your focal length. In other words, if you were shooting on a 100mm lens, a shutter speed of 1/100 of a second would be optimal. Camera blur can be eliminated at these speeds.  ,, When you do this, the action is going to blur, so use thirty or fifteen when there's low light or when you want the action to blur.   Medium shutter speed: 125 or 250 for most pictures. Fast shutter speed: 500 or 1000 for action. Thirtieth or a fifteenth of a second to blur action or under low light.  , You might have the option of a dial, a button on your camera, or you may have to do it in-camera.  , Of course, it goes without saying that you want fantastic exposure, but if you can't get it quite right, err on the side of underexposure (let your scene be a little dark). When a picture is over-exposed, all of the information is lost and cannot be recovered. With underexposed pictures, you have a greater chance of recovering the picture through post-processing. You can set your camera to underexpose by using EV compensation (exposure value compensation).  , The exposure modes on your camera allows you to control how you adjust the picture. The basic mode is the “P” mode (program mode) and it allows you to manipulate both the shutter speed or aperture settings, and it will adjust the other value accordingly so that the picture is exposed perfectly according to the light meter. The advantage of program mode is that you don't need to know anything. It's just a little bit above the green auto or “idiot proof” mode.  , On your digital camera you have the choice of “A-mode” or aperture priority. In the aperture priority mode (it's a way to determine the exposure); you the photographer picks the aperture or f-stop. The camera will choose the shutter speed for you. Aperture priority could be considered the more useful of the modes. So, you select the f-stop, whether it's f/2.8 to blur the background, f/8 for moderate depth of field, or f/16 to have everything in focus.  , Have at least some familiarity with the shutter speed of your camera. The advantage of shutter speed is you set the number that's most convenient or most comfortable to use. Then the camera will pick the other number, the f-stop. On your camera, shutter priority can either be S or TV mode depending on your camera.   In shutter priority mode, pick the shutter speed and the camera sets the f-stop. When in shutter priority, the camera will take the picture at the selected shutter speed regardless of whether or not the picture will be exposed correctly.

Truly engage with what the other person is saying. Avoid interrupting. Listen to what they are saying instead of thinking about what you want to say next. This way you will not feel the need to raise your voice to be heard over theirs, but can be involved in the conversation on an even playing field., Do your best to change the elements in your environment which may cause you to increase the volume of your voice. The more you can adjust the environment to be ideal to hearing what you are saying, the less need you will feel to speak loudly.Get rid of exterior sounds by closing windows and doors. Move closer to the person or people you are talking to. The more distance between you and your audience, the more likely you will feel the need to raise your voice to fill the void. Speak in a small room. Large rooms eat up sound, and you may feel the need to speak up. Choose small rooms for quieter communication.  , Your opinions are valid and deserve to be heard. If you feel that the other person isn’t listening, practice communicating assertively without raising your voice.Meet the other person where they are at. Try to understand where they are coming from and let them know that you get it by saying something like, “I understand you have been under a lot of stress lately,” or, “I know that you are busy right now, so I will be quick.” Stay positive when you are speaking negatively. Even though you disagree with a person, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you dislike the person. There is certainly no need to disrespect them. Say “no.” Sometimes it’s as simple as just learning to say, “no.” If there does not seem to be a solution in sight, you can end the conversation and walk away rather than escalating the argument and raising your voice.  , When speaking with a group of people, there is an urge to talk over others, one-up the other people, or hijack the conversation. As people continue to make these mistakes in a group, the entire group will increase in the volume of their speech.Wait for your opportunity to be heard rather than speaking over someone. Use body language to indicate that you would like to speak. Try raising a finger, nodding, or shaking your head. When you do have the floor, make your point quickly, before someone else jumps in.  , Place one hand at the top of your stomach and the bottom of your rib cage. Inhale into this area and attempt to make your hand rise using your breath. This will put your breath in the right place rather than pushing speech from your nose, chest or mouth. Forcing breath from these places can be grating and loud.Once you have the breath in your diaphragm, try vocalizing from the place where you are resting your hand.  , Having tension in your neck can lead to trying to force the sound out of your throat. Relax your throat in order to relax your voice. Place one hand on your neck and speak normally to assess the tension in your throat. Drop your jaw as low as you can and take in a large yawn. Release the air slowly with a gentle hum. Repeat this several times until you begin to feel your throat relaxing. Once your throat is relaxed, continue dropping your jaw, then exhaling with words like “hang, harm, lane and loam.” Massage your neck throughout this process if you feel it tightening.  , This will help you be heard as well as hearing yourself. Speaking at the same volume, tends to have the effect of the listener tuning the speaker out. This could lead to frustration and tempt the speaker to be even louder. Experiment with varying your volume level. Creating variety in your volume will allow you to be more conscious of your volume and see the effect on your listener. Try speaking at almost a whisper. Make your voice quieter until someone asks you to speak up. Try raising your volume only on the word you would like to emphasize. “That pizza was the BEST!”  , It can be difficult to hear yourself. Ideally you would hire a coach to be an outside ear. They can assess your volume and your needs, then lead you through some exercises which will help you learn how to control your voice. I this is not an option for you at this time, ask a friend to give you feedback.Voice coaches can lead you through some breathing exercises, as well as running through the range of pitch and volume with your voice. If you are working on your own, ask a friend if they have noticed a difference. Give them permission to point out when you raise your voice. When they do point it out, don’t get angry. Remember that they are trying to help you.  , There are two ways that sound reaches the inner ear, through air and bone. Usually, the sound you hear when you speak is a combination of these two pathways. Some people are more sensitive to one or the other.Listening to a recording of yourself eliminates the bone-conducted sound as there is no vibration from the vocal chords to create this pathway. This is why your voice sounds different when you are listening to a recording of yourself. Try wearing earplugs to eliminate the sound conducted by air. Some abnormalities of the inner ear can lead to extra sensitivity of the the bone transfer of sound to the point where you can hear the automatic systems of the body like breathing and moving your eyes. See if eliminating one of these pathways has a significant effect on your hearing.  , Speaking too loudly can be a sign of hearing loss. Other signs of sensorineural hearing loss are difficulty hearing when there is a lot of background noise, and understanding what people are saying with clarity. If you are experiencing these symptoms, see your physician and get your hearing checked., People in positions of power are often trained to speak loudly and with authority, but it also comes naturally to some who have been assigned or consider themselves to be in a high position of power.Where do you place yourself in rank of power? What effect is this having on the people around you? Would it benefit you to reduce your vocal intensity to better communicate on the same level?  , Some people speak loudly because they feel that they are not being heard. Another reaction to this feeling is constantly repeating yourself. If you find yourself doing these things, the cause of speaking loudly could be related to your need to have your thoughts heard.",1145,"['someone', 'motives', 'throat', 'volume level', 'environment', 'group', 'help', 'volume', 'hearing', 'diaphragm', 'competition', 'communication skills']"

Several Rat-Rodding websites also exist with links to possibilities.Look for one that is not especially rusted, and has its essential shape is still intact. Typically, Rats are made from American cars, often pick-ups, manufactured pre-1960. Popular models for Rat Rods include:   Mid-century Chevrolet pick-up trucks '30s-era Fords, esp. the ""Model A"" Early Chrysler hemi engines are popular, as well as flathead V-8s; , To strip it down and start fresh, that means you'll need to remove all the seats, fixtures and other accessories from the car. Typically, cars used for Rat Rods are in pretty bad shape to begin with, in terms of the interior, making this step somewhat necessary.  , Position a container under the drain cock, or remove one of the fuel lines and collect any gas remaining in the gas tank. This is an essential step in prepping the car for Rodding, as you're going to be doing a lot of welding and any remaining traces of gasoline will be dangerous. Keep a fire extinguisher ready in your shop or garage at all times while you're working.  , Measure and mark where you want the vehicle's new axles and wheels to go, then cut the frame up to the desired length using a reciprocating saw. Since a Rat Rod is mostly about the look of the car, you'll mostly be flying by the seat of your pants anyway.   It's usually common to shorten the rear of the vehicle somewhat to accommodate the axle and eliminate any elements, such as roofs or hoods, that you no longer want. Make any cuts to accommodate the drivetrain.  , It's also possible to build your own frame, using about 20 feet (6.1 m) of rectangular 2x4 steel tubing in the early stages, cut into two equal sections. Weld them together, patterned like a ladder, as square and as level as possible. Use one cross member toward the front, one in the back, and a crossing pattern in the middle to support the body. Match the width of the frame to the body you intend to use.  , Among Rat-Rodders, it's a common goal to try to keep the total price-tag somewhere under $3,000 as a badge of your ability to work with limited materials. If you're up for a challenge, put your skills and your resourcefulness to the test and try to keep the project as cheap as possible by scrounging for a mishmash of parts in the junkyard, or on eBay., You can customize your suspension using the latest in modern suspension technology, making the Rat a hybrid of old and new. Having a Model A that turns on a rail? Yes, please.   Start by measuring the rear width or rear body width and finding axles of the appropriate size. The axle should be somewhat longer than the width, and Leaf Spring rear axles are typically popular options because of their possibility for modification. Anything from the 60s and 70s is also popular, depending on the price. Install coil springs in a side-to-side or parallel pattern by welding the upper mounts on the cross member in the rear and the lower mounts to the axle housing. To keep it cheap, use a straight axle in the front, salvaged or new. The suspension from a Mustang II/ Pinto, AMC Pacer or Corvair are popular and useful choices, though ready-to-weld suspension kits are also available, sometimes for as little as a few hundred bucks, complete with frame and axle brackets, as well as template guides. It's a good investment, if you need new parts.  , Old truck bodies are by far the most popular choice, but you can also make use of more modern fiberglass, which is forgiving and easy to work with. Customize your body and make the rod you want, cutting it for the crude-style and swagger you want from a good Rat Rod, then weld it to the frame., try to remember: a Rat Rod is a semi-legal and wonky glorified go-kart, so don't break the bank with the drive train. An old Chevy 350 or a Ford 302 are both super-common and usually-cheap options that you could get and rebuild however you want. Just get the thing running. The great thing about hot-rodding is that if you want to use an engine that really doesn't fit in the body, there's nothing stopping you from doing it but your own creativity and ingenuity. Make it fit. Leave the hood off and do what you want.   You might consider selling the block from the car you got initially, especially if the heads are worn out, then using the extra money you got from the sale to get something from the same era that actually runs. Install any new starters or alternators as you install the engine into the frame. Make sure you have removed as much grease as you can from the engine before installing, then install the transmission and mount the drive shaft and the radiator. Hook up the steering linkage and install the pedals, welding any additional joints that will be necessary to keep the thing together.  , You'll be close to running at this point, but you'll still need to install the brakes and tires to try to make the Rod as safe as possible. It might not be street legal, eventually, but you'll have to make the thing stop. Put in a seat, or cut up a couch and use something bootleg and hilarious. Rat Rods are amenable to any weird ideas you've got about cars aesthetically. Have fun with it!  , Rat Rods will often go without typical car accessories. Windows, covered seats, and even doors are purely optional. Keep your tools handy so that you can continue to tweak your rat rod even after you've taken it out for its first ride. Customize it creatively.  , Some Rat Rodders like to leave the rusty exterior basically as-is, to show how tough and lasting the original was and remains to be. If you want a slightly more polished look, but want to retain some of the grit, go for a matte base coat with some brownish spray highlights that might resemble rust, but also seal the exterior and protect it some.  , Popular at parades and fairs, Rat Rods styled with unique themes will often draw a crowd. Using unusual objects instead of a steering wheel, for example, might be a fun project that'll get people chuckling. Check out other Rat Rods for inspiration and do something unique and fun to make it worth your while.  , Unlike hot rods, rat rods are customized cars that are not meant to resemble an antiquated original. Spice up your vehicle with odd adjustments and a colorful body, or dramatically alter the original frame to create an entirely new shape.

The difference matters in terms of which law applies. For example, if you worked on a federal project, then the federal “Miller Act” applies.States have their own “Little Miller Acts” that apply to state construction projects.In some states, there may even be “county Miller Acts.” These county acts often mirror the state law.; , Not everyone who worked on or supplied materials to a public project can make a claim on the bond. Under federal law, for example, only the following people can make a claim:architects engineers surveyors subcontractors that contract directly with general contractors (called ""first tier"" subcontractors) subcontractors that contract with the first-tier subcontractor (called ""second tier"" subcontractors) “first tier” material suppliers that contract directly with a general contractor “second tier” material suppliers that contract with a first-tier subcontractor (but not with a first-tier material supplier)  , State and local statutes can extend protection beyond the “second-tier” and provide more protection than the federal law. For example, in Georgia, the law protects all subcontractors and providers of materials to the construction project.This includes “third-tier” or “fourth-tier” subcontractors.   You should be able to find your state law online. Type “your state” and “Little Miller” or “bond payment notice” into your favorite search engine. Some law firms have published 50-state surveys you may want to read.This information might not be up-to-date, so you should still perform your own research.  , Under federal law, you have 90 days from the date you last did work or provided materials. Make sure the notice is received within the 90-day window. Don’t simply mail it on the 90th day.State and local laws may have different requirements. You should read those laws to learn the details.  , A qualified attorney can advise you about your state’s requirements and make sure that you properly prepare and serve a Notice of Claim. You can schedule an appointment and have the attorney look over your draft.   You can get a referral to a construction attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Once you have the name of an attorney, call him or her up. Ask how much they charge.  , You perfect a bond payment claim by sending a Notice to your general contractor. However, your state may have other preliminary notices you must send. Each state is different, and the notices required cannot be summarized here. However, you should read your state law and meet with an attorney to make sure you provide all proper notices.   For example, in Georgia, the contractor may file a “Notice of Commencement” within 15 days of starting the project. You will need to serve a Notice to Contractor within 30 days of beginning work. If you don’t, then you will not be able to make a claim against the contractor., Not everyone has to file a Notice of Claim to perfect a payment bond claim. For example, under federal law, someone who contracts directly with a general contractor does not need to provide notice., You can set up your Notice of Claim like a business letter. Be sure to include both your name and your address on the letter, which is required. Address the letter to the project's general contractor.   You should also give the letter a title. In the title you should name the surety (the company that issued the bond) and the bond number.Although this information is not required, it is a good idea nonetheless.  , Make sure to include the date on which you signed a contract to perform work as well as who you signed the contract with. If you contracted with a subcontractor, then identify the subcontractor.   You should also identify the public work that you supplied with material or labor., You should also provide the name and addresses for the general contractor and any upper-tier contractors.For example, if you are a third-tier subcontractor, then you should provide the names of the two subcontractors above you.  , This is another requirement for your Notice of Claim.Provide details about the work you performed or the materials you supplied to the project. Also provide the dates you worked.   If you want, you can generally describe the work or materials provided and then refer to your invoices, which may contain more detail.  , Both state and federal law will require that you accurately state how much money you are owed.You should go through your invoices and total the amount.   Also make copies of the invoices and provide them with your Notice of Claim.  , Remind your general contractor that you are looking to them for payment, since you have not received it from the subcontractor.You can write something like the following:   “Since I have not been paid, I am requesting that you pay me for the work and materials provided, in the amount stated above.”  , You should insert a signature block at the end of the letter and also include the date. Your signature block should contain the following information:name address phone number your title contractor registration number  , You should send your notice to the general contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested. Under some state laws, you can wait to serve a copy on the contractor after you serve the public entity. In Illinois, for example, you have 10 days.Regardless of the law, there is no real reason to delay. You can send the copy to the general contractor when you serve the public entity.  , You should also give notice to the government agency that is having the construction done. For example, if your state’s Department of Health contracted to build a new office, then you need to send notice to the Department.   Send the letter certified mail, return receipt requested. Hold onto the receipt since this is proof that it was received. Some states might let you make hand-delivery on the office.However, you are better off using a courier service so that you have something in writing that shows the date it was received.  , You should also send a copy of your notice to the surety that issued the bond.You should use the same mailing methods that you used for the public entity and the general contractor.  , In some states, such as Kentucky, you need to file your Notice of Claim in the county clerk’s office for the county where the government entity is located.You should check your state law to see if it contains a similar filing requirement.

Your cat may have just come in from outdoors or he may be in the middle of cleaning himself. Wait until he’s not busy with something else before initiating a massage.   Wait about 2 hours after your pet has eaten before massaging him. This will give him a chance to digest his food.; , Get close to your cat and make sure that he's happy to be in your presence. You may even want to wait for him to come to you instead of grabbing him out of his comfort zone. Wait for him to hang out with you, relax, lie down, or even to purr or nuzzle up against you.  , Make your kitty feel calm and happy by getting him into the right state of mind first. Start by singing lightly to your cat or using a low, calming voice and telling your kitty that he's a good boy.   Don't use the high-pitched, squealing voice some people like to use to talk to cats (""You're such a cute little kitty!!"") or you'll actually stress out your kitty even more.  , Take deep breaths and adopt a calm manner. If you are tense or trying to rush through the massage, your pet will sense that and won’t want to get a massage from you., A massage doesn’t have to take a long time. Just 5-10 minutes every day will be sufficient. Spend about a minute massaging each part of your cat’s body to get him nice and relaxed.  , Start the massage by stroking your cat at a slow speed so that your cat gets used to the feel of the massage. Pick your cat’s favorite spot, whether it’s under his chin, on his back or behind the ears. Starting with a familiar place will make your cat more amenable to being massaged all over.  , Many people stroke their cats with their fingertips. This touch might be too light for the cat to feel much, especially along the back or belly. Use your full hand and apply some gentle pressure to the cat’s body as you’re stroking it. Save your fingertips for massaging the head and face.   You can use just one hand or both hands.  , Throughout the massage, pay attention to how your cat responds. If your cat keeps trying to get up, he might not be in the mood to get a massage. If he is blinking, purring, drooling, falling asleep, or even looking a little dazed, he is probably enjoying the massage immensely.   If your cat suddenly scratches or bites you, his skin might be getting over-stimulated. Cats’ skin is extremely sensitive and if it’s over-stimulated, it can actually hurt the cat. Get to know how your cat responds to being petted on different parts of his body., Most cats love to have their heads massaged. Use your palms of your hands to give your kitty circular rubs on the top of his head as well as on the back of his head and on his temples.Use your fingertips to massage around and behind his ears.   You might want to come back to the head after you’ve massaged your cat more, since he might need to be more relaxed in order to fully appreciate having his head massaged.  , After you've massaged your cat's head, rub under the cat's neck very slowly and gently. Massage your cat with your fingers, making small circular motions up and down his neck. Be careful not to press into his neck. You can use one hand or two.  , Use little circular motions with your fingers to massage his cheeks and his forehead. You can also use the palms of your hands on each side of his face. Your cat may purr or close his eyes in approval. If he likes what you're doing, he may even let you massage the little area around his eyes, on his nose or around his whiskers.  , After you finish massaging his head and neck, give your cat a few firm pets on his body. Apply gentle pressure with your hand while you stroke him from head to tail.This will help his body relax into the rest of the massage.  , Start rubbing your cat’s shoulders in circles slowly. Place one hand on each of your cat's sides and give your kitty a good rubdown. Gently but firmly use both hands to knead the sides of your cat's body, especially his or her shoulders., Moving down the back from the shoulders, apply gentle pressure along your cat’s back and sides, using circular motions.   Keep your attention on your cat’s upper back, as the lower back and hips can be sensitive for many cats. If your cat likes to be touched in this area, then massage it very gently., If your cat is relaxed enough, he may lie on his back and allow you to rub his belly. Gently hold him with one hand and massage his belly with the other, kneading the skin along his belly. If he's really relaxed, you can even use both hands to massage his belly.   Some cats really don't like to have their bellies touched, so do this carefully at first.You can also mix it up, massaging your cat's belly with one hand while massaging his head or back with the other. Try massaging your cat's chest muscles too, which need a good massage from time to time.  , Start by massaging your cat's tail at the base, near his rump, and then slowly work your way toward the end of the tail. You can use both hands, but work lightly with the fingers, since the tail is a very sensitive place for the cat. If you just go for your cat's tail first, he's likely to run away from you. You have to get the rest of his body relaxed before he will enjoy a tail massage.   You can even massage his head with one hand and massage the tail with the other. If he starts wildly moving his tail, then he's getting excited and maybe even angry, which is the opposite of what you want.  , While you’re massaging your cat, this is an ideal time to check your cat’s overall health. Check the fur to see if your cat has been grooming himself.If the fur is matted or greasy, this could indicate health problems such as diabetes, bladder infections or other issues. If it seems unclean in only a few spots, this might indicate that your cat has trouble reaching certain areas of his body, perhaps because of arthritis. If the fur is over-groomed and the fur is actually missing or sparse in some areas, this could indicate a dermatological issue, such as a skin irritation or allergy.  , As you rub your fingers and hands over your cat’s body, dig under the fur gently to check the health of your cat’s skin. If you feel bites or bumps, your cat might have fleas or other skin irritations.  , Cats can get feverish, which can indicate an illness of some sort. As you massage your cat, you will get a sense of his normal body temperature. If you feel that his body is warmer than usual, start checking for other indications of illness or injury, such as an infected cut or vomiting.   Heated spots on the body might also indicate arthritis., Take note of any abnormalities that you might find as you massage your cat.Lumps and bumps can indicate serious health issues, so it’s good to be aware of what’s normal for your cat and what’s not., Your vet is the best source for assessing your cat’s health. If you’ve discovered a lump, skin problem or other health issue, ask your vet if the issue should be treated.

You can check to make sure that the name of your LLC is not in use with the Colorado LLC Search Tool. Keep in mind that one of the following terms must be in the name of your LLC:   ""Limited Liability Company"" ""Ltd. Liability Company"" ""Limited Liability Co."" ""Ltd. Liability Co."" ""Limited"" ""L.L.C."" ""LLC"" ""Ltd.""; , The owners of an LLC are called ""members."" They're the people who have a financial interest in the company that goes well beyond the interest of an employee or a customer.  , A manager is effectively the chief executive officer (CEO) of the company. He or she is the one who will set the strategic direction of the company and oversee day-to-day operations from an upper management perspective.   The manager of the LLC doesn't have to be a member, but it's generally a good idea.  , In Colorado, you can choose to have either a member-managed or a manager-managed LLC. Choose the option that best fits the management structure you want.   In a member-managed LLC, all of the members (owners) of the LLC will actively participate in the management and operation of the business. This is the most common selection and is particularly prevalent when you are creating a single-member LLC.Select a manager-managed LLC if some of your owners are merely passive investors who will not (or do not want to) be involved in the day-to-day operation of the business. If you are a sole-member LLC, you may select this option if you are going to hire someone else to run the business while you become a passive investor., An operating agreement is written to cover the economic and governance structure of your LLC. It is akin to having articles of incorporation, bylaws, and shareholder agreements wrapped into one document. It may even include a statement of social purpose.   In Colorado, an operating agreement may contain any provision dealing with the affairs of the LLC. Once you write an operating agreement, your LLC will be bound by its terms. You may enter into an operating agreement before, during, or after, you file your articles of incorporation. except in the case of single member LLCs, an operating agreement does not need to be in writing. Therefore, in most cases, you may choose to either write or not write the agreement out., Your business is a separate legal entity. As such, it will need its own tax ID or Employer Identification Number (EIN). Apply for a EIN Number from the IRS. If you are selling goods or collecting taxes, you might need to register your EIN and LLC with the Colorado Department of Revenue.   If you own and operate a sole member LLC, which means you are the only person managing and working for the LLC, you do not need an EIN.  , A registered agent is a legal representative in the state who can receive legal notices for the business on your behalf. You can be the registered agent for the LLC if you live in the state of Colorado. Otherwise, you're going to need to find someone else to be a registered agent on your behalf.You can simply Google ""Colorado registered agent"" to find a list of registered agents available for that state.  , You'll find an online form that you need to complete at the Secretary of State's Site.  , You'll enter the name that you decided on above and then click ""Next.""   If you select a name that's already in use, the system won't let you proceed any further.  , The principal is generally the name of the person who's forming the LLC. If that's you, then enter your business name and address here.   If your business address is the same as your personal address, you can just enter your personal address here.  , If you selected a registered agent in the step above, then you'll fill in that information in this section. Otherwise, you can enter the principal's name and address.  , You entered your business address two sections above. Here's where you'll enter your personal address.   It's okay to duplicate information if your business address is the same as your personal address.  , If the LLC is member-managed (meaning one of the members will manage it), then check the radio button that reads ""Members."" If you're planning on hiring a manager who isn't a member, check on the radio button that reads ""Manager.""  , Your LLC should have one member at a minimum, so just check the box.  , There might be some legal or identification documents that you'll need to complete your LLC registration process. If so, select ""Yes"" here and you can upload those documents during the next step.   Examples of additional documents include articles of organization, articles of amendment, and an operating agreement.Chances are very good you won't need to upload any documents. You'll probably only need to do that if somebody from the Secretary of State's office told you that additional documentation is required.  , You'll probably want to form your LLC immediately. If that's the case, then you don't need to take any action under the ""Delayed Effective Date"" section. However, if you want to put off your LLC formation for another month or so, just click the ""No"" option and enter the effective date.  , If you want the Colorado Secretary of State to notify you from time to time about due dates or events affecting your business, select ""Yes"" under ""Email Address"" and enter the appropriate email address.  , Yes, there's yet another section for the ""true name and address"" of the person who's filing the document.

As of this writing, the payment fee is $50.  , Every year, your LLC is required to file annual reports with the Secretary of State. The report must state your LLC's name and any changes you have made to the entity since you last filed (e.g., if the agent's name and address have changed).While the information contained in these reports is minimal, it is very important you file them on time.

You should determine if you child has anxiety or another condition, and if the anxiety is severe enough to warrant medication.   If your child has anxiety, there may be non-medication management strategies that you can use to help the anxiety. These alternatives to medication may be preferable over medication. Be sure that your child needs medication before putting them on medication. Don't just take a doctor's word for it. Think about your child's symptoms, get them checked out by a psychiatrist, and even get a second opinion if you don't feel comfortable giving your child anti-anxiety medication.; , The most common type of medication prescribed for adolescents with anxiety disorders is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This type of medicine is considered an antidepressant, but has been found to be the most effective for treating adolescent anxiety. SSRIs help increase serotonin levels in the brain by blocking your brain from reabsorbing serotonin so that it remains available in your brain.A few examples of SSRIs include:Sertraline (Zoloft) Citalopram (Celexa) Paroxetine (Paxil) Fluoxetine (Prozac)  , SSRIs are the most common antidepressant medications, but there are a few other types you may consider. For example, there are serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which block the absorption of serotonin and norepinephrine.Examples of SNRIs include Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and Venlafaxine (Effexor, Pristiq).Atypical antidepressants may also be an option. These include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as Amitriptyline (Elavil) and Clomipramine (Anafranil). The last type are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which include Phenelzine (Nardil) and Tranylcypromine (Parnate).  , Many anti-anxiety medications used to treat anxiety in adults are not used for treatment in children or adolescents; however, if your adolescent suffers from acute anxiety that is crippling them, interfering severely with school performance, or causing problems at home, your doctor may consider putting your child on benzodiazepines temporarily.Benzodiazepines can help with physical anxiety symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, or trembling.Benzodiazepines include Alprazolam (Xanax), Diazepam (Valium), and Clonazepam (Klonopin).  , Anxiety can cause sleep disturbances, which can leave your child tired and irritable. This can negatively impact their school work and daily lives. The doctor may prescribe a temporary medication to help your adolescent sleep if insomnia or other sleep disturbances have become a major problem.Common sleep medications include Trazodone (Desyrel), Zolpidem (Ambien), Eszopiclone (Lunesta), and even Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).  , Before you choose to give your child any medication, you should be aware of the risks associated with adolescents taking antidepressants or other anti-anxiety drugs. Since antidepressants such as SRIs were designed and tested on adults, there have not been any definitive research on how these drugs affect developing brains.Each class of medication has it's own side effect and risk profile. Your doctor will help you decide which medication is best and safest for your child. There is an increased risk of suicidal thoughts during the first few months of taking the antidepressant. When your child starts taking any medication for their anxiety, you should closely monitor them for signs of suicide.  , Before your adolescent starts any medication, you should take them to the doctor. You may start by taking them to the pediatrician or general physician, who then can give you a referral to a mental health specialist who specializes in adolescent mental health. Your child will need a psychiatric evaluation before being prescribed any medication for anxiety.In addition, your general physician may rule out other medical causes of your child's symptoms, such as an overactive thyroid, or other hormonal disorders.   During this exam, the psychiatrist will address any risk factors that may lead to self-harm The psychiatrist will make sure your child has an anxiety disorder and rule out other disorders, such as ADHD or bipolar disorder. The doctor will ask about your family’s history of mental illness. You should make sure to tell your psychiatrist about any liver or heart problems your child suffers from, along with any medications they are taking, including vitamins, supplements, and over-the-counter meds., Even if you and your doctor decide your child should take medication for their anxiety, you should consider getting your child therapy. Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, has been proven to help treat the symptoms, behaviors, and underlying issues associated with anxiety.Many studies have shown that medication mixed with psychotherapy and CBT is more effective than medication alone.Psychotherapy helps address the adolescent’s sense of failure, guilt, and self-blame. Talk therapy and CBT can help your child deal with their feelings, recognize their anxieties, and learn how to reduce them. CBT helps the adolescent recognize unhealthy thought patterns and replace them with healthier ones. Parent counseling can help parents learn how to manage and deal with their child’s illness. It can also help parents learn how to deal with their own negative feelings associated with the child’s anxiety. Group and school-based counseling can help the child deal with social aspects of their anxiety disorder.  , It is important for you to take your adolescent to the doctor for follow-up appointments. Your doctor will monitor your child’s progress on the medication, as well as their reactions. You should alert your doctor to any side effects, changes in behavior, suicidal thoughts, or other concerns.Never stop your child’s medication without first discussing it with your child’s doctor. Stopping medication can cause withdrawal symptoms.  , You should decide whether your adolescent is mature enough or trustworthy enough to take the medication on their own. Even if you believe they can be trusted to take their medication, you should watch to make sure they are taking the correct dosage. Most adolescents are prescribed the smallest dosage, which means taking more than that dosage can lead to an overdose.If your child is supposed to take half a pill, take it upon yourself to break up all pills before they start taking them so a whole pill is not taken by accident. Talk to your child and explain the routine of taking the medication. Tell them how many pills they will take, how many times a day they will take it, and when they will take them. Until your adolescent gets familiar with the routine, help them take their medication. You may have to remind your child to take the medication each day. Contact the school nurse if your child has to take their medication at school.  , You should monitor your child carefully after they begin taking antidepressants or other medications to treat anxiety. Antidepressants can cause many different negative side effects. Some physical side effects, like weight loss or gain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, or headaches may not require an immediate call to the doctor.You should call your doctor right away if you notice any of the following side effects:Worsening anxiety Signs of new depression Panic attacks Extreme agitation, restlessness, or irritability Insomnia Aggression or violent outburst Dangerous impulsive behavior Suicidal thoughts — you may want to take your child to the emergency room Other behavior changes  , In addition to medication and therapy, there are ways your adolescent can manage their anxiety at home. The doctor or therapist can help give you ways to help your child at home, but common methods for managing anxiety includes relaxation techniques, stress-relieving activities, and socializing.You should encourage your child to exercise. Exercise helps relieve stress and has been proven to reduce anxiety symptoms. This can include any activity, such as sports, jogging, walking the dog, dancing, playing at the park with friends, or joining a gym. Help your adolescent find ways to let out negative emotions. This may include creating art or music, dancing, singing, or writing. Make sure your child gets enough sleep. Adequate sleep each night can help your child’s overall well-being, as well as reduce anxiety symptoms. Teenagers may need between eight and ten hours of sleep, while younger children may need nine to eleven hours each night.",1317,"['antidepressant medication', 'types', 'anxiety', 'side effects', 'risks', 'adolescent needs medication', 'doctor', 'severe anxiety', 'appointment', 'child', 'therapist', 'benzodiazepines', 'selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors', 'right dosage', 'follow-up appointments', 'sleep']"
"['learn the rhyming structure of the triolet poem', 'read examples of the triolet poem', 'analyze the examples', 'brainstorm', 'create your first', 'repeating line', 'make your second', 'repeating line', 'fill in the supporting lines', 'read the completed triolet out loud', 'title your triolet']",How to Write a Triolet Poem," The structure of a triolet poem is based on a rhyming scheme where the first line of the poem is used three times and the second line of the poem is used twice. The structure can be broken down by:A (first line) B (second line) a (rhymes with the first line) A (repeat the first line) a (rhymes with the first line) b (rhymes with the second line) A (repeat the first line) B (repeat the second line); , To get a better sense of how to use the structure of the triolet to create a unique poem, look at several examples, including:   Thomas Hardy’s “How Great is My Grief”.Peter Poole’s “Feed Me Lord That I Might Live”LuAnn Kennedy’s “The Night”, Choose one or two examples and note how they use the repetition of the first line and the second line to enhance meaning in the poem. Ask yourself:   Does the meaning of repeated first line and the repeated second line shift throughout the poem? For example, in Hardy’s triolet “How Great is My Grief”, the first line underlines the overall grief and sorrow of the speaker and enhances the lines between the repeated lines in the poem. How do the supporting lines respond or react to the repeated lines in the triolet? In Hardy’s poem, the supporting lines put the repeating lines into a certain context. They tell the reader that the speaker has known the subject of the poem over the course of “slow years” and they have shared memories with the subject or “thee” of the poem. What note does the last line end the poem on? How does the last line, the repeated second line, enhance the overall meaning of the poem? Hardy alters the meaning of the repeated last line by using a question mark, instead of an exclamation mark. This leaves the reader in a state of wonder, as the speaker seems to be posing a question to the subject of the poem, but the reader will never know the answer.  , Think about what you want the triolet poem to be about, or the theme or subject of the poem. One way to brainstorm a theme or subject is to create an association diagram, also known as a clustering technique.Take out a sheet of paper. Write your main topic or subject in the middle of the paper. For example, “a tortoise”. Moving out from the center, write down other words that pop into your mind that relates back to “a tortoise”. You can also draw a circle or box around the main topic and use little lines to connect the other words to the main topic. For example, for “a tortoise”, you might write “hard shell”, “ancient”, “slow”, “wise”, “dark green”. Don’t worry about organizing the words as you write. Simply let the words flow around the main topic. Once you feel you have written enough words around the main topic, start to cluster the words. Draw a circle around words that relate to each other and draw a line between the circled words to connect them. Continue doing this with the other words. Some of the terms may end up uncircled, but these lone words can still be useful.Focus on how the words relate back to the main topic. If you have clustered together several words that relate to “wise”, for example, maybe this may be a good approach for the triolet. Or if there are a lot of clustered words that focus on “dark green”, this may be another way to approach “a tortoise.” Answer questions like: “I was surprised by…” or “I discovered…” For example, you may look over the clustered words and note “I was surprised by how often I mention my father in relation to a tortoise.” Or, “I discovered I may want to write about how a tortoise means a wise and old personality or character, like my father.”, Some poets find coming up with your main, repeating line first, (A) in the scheme of ABaAabAB, can help to develop the rest of the poem. The (A) line will need to be a line that can be repeated several times in the poem, it should have an ending word that will rhyme with other words, and a strong or powerful tone that will be a good opening and closing for the poem. Many poets also try to make the first line eight to ten syllables long so that it is not too wordy and it will flow with the rest of the poem.   For example, for a triolet about a tortoise, your (A) line might be: “My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.” This is an ideal (A) line because it ends on a word that is easy to rhyme with other words and it stays close to 10 syllables.  , The second line of the poem, the (B) line, will also need to be strong and have impact, as it will be a grounding line throughout the poem. The line should end with a word that is easy to rhyme with other words, as you will need to create a supporting line that rhymes with the (B) line.   If you continue the triolet about a tortoise, your (B) line might be: “Though he was once a young man like me.”  , To help you come up with the supporting middle lines of the poem, it may be helpful to place your (A) line and your (B) line within the eight line structure of the triolet:   “My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.” “Though he was once a young man like me.” (supporting line that rhymes with first line) “My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.” (supporting line that rhymes with first line) (supporting line that rhymes with second line) “My father is a tortoise, wise and slow.” “Though he was once a young man like me.” Once you have positioned your first and second lines, you can do some free writing to fill in the supporting lines. Note that you will need to end the supporting lines so they rhyme with the applicable lines in the poem.  , Now that you have filled in all eight lines of the poem, read the triolet out loud to ensure it flows well and each line follows the triolet structure.   For example, your completed triolet about your father, the tortoise, might be: “My father is a tortoise, wise and slow” “Though he was once a young man like me” “He is full of knowledge I will never know” “My father is a tortoise, wise and slow” “His thoughts and memories he will not show” “Yet I try to set them free” “My father is a tortoise, wise and slow” “Though he was once a young man like me.”  , Once you have a completed triolet, it will need a title. Many poets use the first line of the triolet as the title of the poem, or they choose the theme or subject to act as the title of the poem.   For the triolet example about your father, a good title might be: “The Tortoise”.  ",1188,"['supporting lines', 'triolet poem', 'examples', 'rhyming structure', 'triolet', 'line']"

Are there any features that stand out? If you can enlarge the photos, do so. There is also no harm in e-mailing for extra photos if desired, along with any questions you have about the images.   Pay extra attention to the condition of the item in the photos. Are they only showing the picture of the box? You should be able to see the condition of the item in detail.  , This is a trap for many buyers. The item seems like a great price -- until the shipping and handling costs are factored in. If they are not displayed, e-mail for the costs to your part of the world. Also be aware that some sellers will not ship to some locations.  , Overall feedback and comments are a good reflection of the seller's good faith, successful previous sales and even speed of shipping. Anything above 95% is usually an indication that the seller is good - some negative feedback is to be expected in the world of sales and may simply be a reflection of a difficult customer or someone who had expectations that were unrealistic.   Check how many transactions the seller has performed. While it may not be wrong to do business with someone with only a few transactions (they may be new!), you are more likely to receive good service from sellers that have performed a large number of sales. A seller with a lot of sales will usually process your order faster and work to ensure that you are satisfied.  , PayPal is one of the most common payment methods on eBay, as payments can be processed immediately. If you don’t have a PayPal account, it is recommended that you set one up before you begin bidding to make the process smoother.   Don’t purchase from sellers who only accept cash. Avoid these sellers.  , This will give you the average prices paid for the item in the past which lets you make a comparison and gives you a notion whether the ""Buy It Now"" price or the auction listing prices are fair or not. If you are bidding, as opposed to buying immediately, it gives you an indication of how much you should be willing to bid.   You can perform a Completed Listings search by clicking the ""Advanced"" link next to the search bar. Check the ""Completed listings"" box in the ""Search including"" section. Enter in your search keywords and then click the Search button. Listings in red will be completed listings.  , The “Buy it Now” option allows you to purchase the item for a set price instead of having to go through the bidding process. For rarer items, using the “Buy it Now” option may actually save you money if a bidding war starts.   Be sure to check the average price for the item you are purchasing. If you use the “Buy it Now” option, you may end up paying more than it’s worth.  , Your bid will automatically increase by the minimum bidding interval until you reach the maximum amount you entered. This will allow you to set a maximum that you’re comfortable with without having to constantly monitor the auction.   Placing any bid binds you to the auction. By placing the bid, you are agreeing to pay the amount that the auction closes at. You cannot retract bids, so be sure that you are sure that you want the item. Bids can only be retracted if there was an error in entering a bid to begin with, not if you change your mind on an item.  , As the auction progresses, you will be notified if your maximum amount has been outbid. If you can and want to, you can increase the amount of your bid by returning to the listing and entering in a new amount.  , If you win the item, you will be notified. Once the auction ends, you are obligated to get in touch with the seller and work out payment and shipping details., Once the auction is complete and you have declared the winner, you and the seller need to get in touch. This communication will allow you to choose your payment method and confirm your shipping address and the shipping and handling fees. The seller will ship the item once they receive confirmation that payment has been made.  , If the seller does not receive payment within two days of the auction ending, they can open a case against you through eBay. You can avoid this by quickly paying for your item as soon as the auction is completed.   Paying quickly will often result in the seller leaving good feedback for you, which will make future sellers more likely to quickly work with you.  , The entire eBay system revolves around buyers and sellers leaving feedback for each other after the completion of a transaction. Leaving feedback for sellers after a transaction is considered good etiquette. Use the feedback to let other buyers know if the seller is reliable. Feedback options include:   Positive: You are satisfied with the transaction and would likely buy from that seller again. Neutral: You may have some issues with the sale process but not enough to leave a negative. Negative: Something about the sale disappointed or upset you. Before leaving negative feedback, always try to contact the seller and seek resolution. Most sellers will try to remedy any errors that they have caused because they value their feedback status. Many now offer refunds and in some cases, you may be able to reach a compromise that makes both sides happy. If you cannot reach a resolution, eBay can also intervene for you. After trying a reasonable amount to resolve the issue and you still have no happy outcome, leave a factual message as to why you found the transaction to be negative. Avoid abuse or inflammatory statements; these reflect badly on you and may cause future sellers to block you.  , If you have troubles with receiving the item from the seller, receiving an item in a different condition than was advertised, or have any other issues, contact the eBay Resolution Center. You can use this online tool to file a complaint, and potentially receive a refund from eBay for the purchase you made.   Always try to resolve your issue with the seller directly before using the Resolution Center. Most good sellers will attempt to make things right without having to escalate to eBay customer service.

Ask yourself if you believe you have the best intentions for both individuals by stopping their wedding. Try to understand why the couple has decided to get married and if you may be the only person feeling otherwise.   Talk with family members or other people involved in the wedding to find out if someone else feels similarly. If you want to stop a wedding it's best to find legal reasons why it shouldn't happen. Do not base halting a wedding purely off of emotions like jealousy or hatred. Those can be worked through with communication and therapy.; , Go directly to the couple-to-be and calmly discuss why you believe their wedding should be stopped. If there are legal reasons they should not be married bring these up and show the facts.   Imagine how you would feel if someone tried to stop you from having your wedding. Go into your discussion with the couple thinking carefully about the words you use and your reasoning. Make sure to stay calm and collected to get your point across in the best way. Voice your concerns and why you feel so strongly opposed to the wedding, but also listen to them and hear their side. Offer solutions if you bring up legal problems and it's more likely the couple will listen and cooperate.  , If you need to, ask to speak individually with the couple-to-be. This is beneficial if you don't think you can keep a cool head talking with them both at the same time. Discuss your concerns with them separately.   This may be a good time to ask questions about how they are feeling about the wedding, and what their future looks like in their eyes; why they believe their significant other is the one for them etc. That kind of discussion could bring up uncertainty they may have about getting married and you can use it to enable them to think a little more, and possibly call off the wedding.  , If you can't convince one or both of the lovebirds to call off the wedding, you can try getting them to hold off for a year.   The expense of a wedding is a great excuse to need to wait to save up more money. Planning a wedding is a lot of time and effort. For some, schooling, athletics, or current hobbies may take up much of their time and you can use this as another excuse to wait. Another excuse to hold off until another year would be family events coming up such as grandpa's 80th or the birth of a new baby. You could use these by saying how much nicer it may be to have a wedding when the celebration will be all about them. If none of these are true, and you feel the couple actually isn't a good match, you can also tell them the truth if you think they will listen; you believe they should wait a year to see what comes of their relationship, and if they're still together and happy its testament of their bond and they can decide to get married then.  , Discuss holding a wedding celebration, but without the minister and paperwork. No one else has to know it's not legally binding and everyone can still enjoy themselves. This may satisfy a couple looking forward to the event and festivity but avoid any trouble later with divorce lawyers if it doesn't end well.  , If you know the wedding is a fraud, or there are legal reasons the wedding should not go through as planned, you have at least 28 days to take legal action. Couples must let a registrar know of their decision to get married and the registrar is required to make that information public for at least 28 days.Laws vary by jurisdiction, and each case is situation. Call or visit your local courthouse to discuss the steps you need to take once you have legal reasons the couple cannot get married.  , If you have a good reason to believe the wedding should be stopped it will help if you get others to feel the same way. If you feel it may be your only way to stop the wedding, share your research you've done with the family and friends of the couple to obtain a greater opposition. Use this pressure to divide the couple.   This should be done as a last resort as it could be very traumatic, or it could actually bring the couple closer together in their possible attempt to escape and elope. Crashing a wedding is not advised. It is a dramatic and reputation-damaging route which may not even work since some couples are legally married by signing the marriage license before the wedding ceremony. The recommended plan would be to talk way ahead of time with the couple to avoid expenses and chaos and to have a rational discussion where you all share your sides.  , If the couple are relying on both or one set of their parents to support the wedding, you may want to try to stop the money source so the wedding will be called off. If you have legal reasons, again, share this with the parents and let them know they may be financially supporting a harmful situation. If there aren't legal reasons you can still voice other concerns and attempt to stop the money flow.  , You can use an annulment to legally cancel-out the marriage as if it never happened.After the wedding one of the two newly weds can call for an annulment for several different reasons.   The marriage was with a minor and required approval from the court and/or parental consent. The marriage was not consummated and neither spouse were able to have sexual relations. Either spouse were mentally ill or mentally incapacitated; involved with drugs or drunk. If the marriage was illegal based on incest If the marriage was fraudulent; one spouse marrying the other based on lies. If a spouse was forced or blackmailed into the marriage. If either of the two were still married to someone else at the time of the wedding.If you know the wedding is going to happen on any of those pretenses then you may still be able to null out the marriage after the wedding. Talk with the person whom you believe should initiate the annulment and show them how they can escape the marriage.  , If the couple are fairly young and it's their first marriage there's a 40% chance the marriage will end in divorce.Waiting is not a fantastic solution since there may not actually be an end in sight. This should be your very last resort. This could be a good plan if you believe the relationship is already particularly unstable.  , If you feel you've done all you can rationally do to stop the wedding without success, it's time to accept the inevitable. It may take time, but since you have no control over the couples' decisions, the best way to get over your opposition is to move forward with your life.

"['choose your resources carefully', 'balance your lifestyle', 'consider the nature of mindfulness', 'stop and observe', 'identify what is going on', 'step back', 'explore the experience', 'take your time', 'avoid fighting your experience', 'confront internal conflict with kindness', 'accept what cannot be changed', 'boost pleasant experiences', 'expand your own compassion and wisdom']",How to Use Mindfulness for a Stress Free Life," Mindfulness is best known from its Buddhist roots and has been adapted as a secular practice. The risk has been in modern times that in an effort to strip mindfulness practices from its traditional religious source, it has also stripped itself of many of the internal checks and balances without providing adequate compensations for these very important tools. It is wise to read widely before engaging in any practice.; , For mindfulness to work, it is crucial to adapt your lifestyle in the beginning, as well as during the time you practice. This is a very important safeguard, but also makes the mindfulness more effective. You may balance your lifestyle by considering the following checklist.   Time: If you live a very busy life at work or school, as well as at home, it can be very difficult to practice. Dedicating some private time for your own practice, or reducing your duties will aid progress immensely. With a mind that is too busy, it can be too difficult to identify the root cause of the problem you are currently dealing with. Perspective. If you have a positive outlook, even in times of trouble and stress, then you have an enormous advantage. If you incline towards more negative moods and perspectives, intentionally start to look for a silver lining in the situation, and ultimately a view of letting go. This in itself may seem trivial, but actually acts as a very effective way of separating yourself from an issue that may be otherwise all-consuming. Energy. If developed well, mindfulness may give you more energy and enthusiasm as it reveals new and interesting aspects of your interactions with life and people, that can give you room for creativity and inspiration. However, it takes energy to get the ball rolling. If you are tired, then it is always better to rest, meditate or have a pamper session to recuperate. As your practice develops then these times of low energy can actually be very revealing and helpful. Physical and Mental Health. Unfortunately, mindfulness has occasionally been mis-represented as a cure-all and for practitioners suffering from a mental condition such as paranoia, severe anxiety, severe depression or borderline personality complexes should not undertake mindfulness with the view of a quick-fix, or without qualified instruction. Physical health is also important as good health and dietary habits make the practice more easy.  , In the Buddhist tradition, the ancient word used for mindfulness also means: recognition, awareness, memory, intent and wakefulness. Simple observation or noting techniques are actually only one third of the practice, the next third is recognizing or identifying what is going on, and finally experimenting and learning about the experience so that you may then act effectively. For this reason, mindfulness is a personal journey that develops as you go.  , Wether you are busy in the moment or taking some quiet introspection time, such as meditation, look at what you feel, what you are thinking, what is going on around you.  , Some techniques involve a personal narrative, such as ""I am feeling tired"" or ""I am feeling frustrated"", but other methods are simply pure observation. Use whichever is easiest for you. Ultimately, when your practice has developed, the personal narrative is not necessary, but can still be used as you see fit. Mindfulness is not a fixed system.  , This means essentially that you don't become tied up with the experience, because the trap is creating more feelings and thoughts about existing feelings and thoughts, thus complicating your experience and making things worse! When you begin, it is best to practice on neutral or pleasant experience because it can be a much simpler way to learn how to look at things impartially, for example as you might look at a nice flower in a vase, or an article in the paper. When handling difficult situations as a beginner, take it slowly and use different skills and means such as discussing the issue with a trusted friend, or simply taking a rest so that you can deal with it later and then reflecting on what happened.  , Again, only do this when you are confident, because mindfulness techniques really start to become effective is when you feel more confident to face the experience with an open mind. The more you learn about the experience, be it a negative one; the less it will dominate you, but at the same time the more you explore a pleasant experience, you can appreciate it with far more happiness and depth of heart.  , Mindfulness in many ways is understanding your habitual ways of responding to a situation, as well as understanding the situation you are in. Sometimes it can become clear that your habitual way of response is the source of your stress, sometimes it is seeing a solution to the problem itself. By relieving yourself of expectations and pressures, you give yourself a much easier time to understand how gradually the habits can be changed, and how your own insight can be developed to give you far more freedom. As your practice develops, you may be surprised suddenly to recognize that simply by knowing what you experience had dissolved the complexity and stress in itself.  , No matter how challenging the experience, eventually an experienced practitioner recognizes the experience itself was not the enemy, nor were their emotions, sensations or thoughts the enemy. People are internally primed to fight off all conflicts without understanding that the real problem as such, was always the lack of understanding. The cause of stress is the wild, confused, habitual and frightened mind lashing out at imagined monsters, making mountains out of molehills, or wanting to change the world.  , This is an aspect of mindfulness that in its traditional form is crucial, yet often is abandoned in secular forms because many inherently reject or feel uncomfortable with the idea - which in itself is actually a telling expression of self-aversion. The kindness and compassion recognises that you don't need to fight your own mind or with other people, and that it heals the mind in a way that is both deep and groundbreaking. It can also, just by its presence, soothe and remove many internal subtle problems that were not evident at the time.  , This is a very advanced and difficult stage to manage. There will always be tragedies that are beyond resolution, so mindfulness is about recognising and accepting ones' own limitations. This in many ways relieves the pressures from a person, because when the nature of some challenges is that they can never be changed reveals that a practitioner can always do their best, but when it is beyond help it is not a failure. This is the ground of healing, of letting go of stress and moving on, without becoming trapped in the past.  , As an extension of the practice of kindness, boosting your pleasant experiences with similar feelings of joy, self worth, gratitude and generosity will reset your habitual ways of dealing with stress as well as enriching ordinary experiences. A simple cup of tea made by a loved one, or one that you made for a loved one can become a deeply wonderful moment, and a practitioner eventually inclines to looking for opportunities to make someone's day. These experiences will often overpower negative experiences and give the practitioner a deep sense of contentment and confidence.  , By reflecting often on quality states of mind and quality experiences, a skilled practitioner often shares these skills with others without even applying effort, such as being a good friend to those you know who are experiencing their own troubles, or enriching one's relationships and interactions in life. This in turn, deepens your own mindfulness and insight to living a stress free life.

You may need to find an enjoyable hobby or a more gratifying line of work, make some more friends, or seek therapy to deal with past traumas. Do whatever you need to do to be the happiest you can be so that you can be the best possible spouse.No one can rely entirely on another person to make them happy. If you feel your spouse is unhappy for reasons that are not directly related to your marriage, encourage him or her to work on personal happiness as well.; , Your attitude can have a huge effect on the health of your marriage. If you tend to be negative, make a conscious effort to be more positive, and your spouse will be much happier.Negative people tend to criticize and make lots of demands, both of which can lead to marital conflict. If you're not sure where to start in changing your attitude, make a conscious effort to avoid these two behaviors.  , Stress from a busy life can often cause people to lash out at their loved ones, even when they don't mean to. In order to avoid this unnecessary conflict, work on getting your own stress under control.You may want to try relaxation techniques such visualization, meditation, or yoga. If you have a lot of stress, you may also benefit from counseling.  , It's important not to come to a marriage with unrealistic expectations of the relationship, as this will cause both partners to be unhappy. Take a moment to assess what you expect of your relationship and determine whether you are being overly idealistic.Watch for mind reading. Mind reading is a common unrealistic expectation in relationships. You may expect your partner to know what you want without having to say what you want. For example, you would be engaging in mind reading if you expect your partner to come and sit next to you on the sofa without asking him or her to do so.  Consider the importance you place on your feelings. Expecting your partner to change his or her behaviour for your benefit is also unrealistic. For example, if you get upset because your partner plays soccer with his friends on Saturday mornings, then you would be engaging in an unrealistic expectation if you think your partner should give up this hobby for your benefit and disregard his own feelings.Keep track of your expectations. To become more aware of any unrealistic expectations that you might be imposing on your partner, start writing them down. Then, take time to reflect on whether or not an expectation is reasonable and worthwhile. For example, you might ask yourself, does this expectation help or hurt my relationship? If the expectation is hurting your relationship, then you might simply say to yourself, “Having this expectation is not in my best interest.”, While you should not have to change who you are in order to make your spouse happy, you may want to consider making small changes or compromises to accommodate your partner. Pay attention to things that your spouse asks you to do (or not do), and try to make them more habitual.For example, if it drives your spouse crazy that you leave your dirty clothes on the floor, try to become a little neater and make a habit out of putting your clothes in the hamper every day.  , Happy couples make a habit of spending quality time together regularly. It will be much more enjoyable for you and your spouse to spend time together if you can find something to do that is interesting to both of you, so try to cultivate some common interests.It's a good idea to go out on dates together once a week. Try to plan a few short getaways throughout the year as well.  , While time together is healthy, most couples also need their space. Work with your partner to figure out how much time together and apart works for both of you.Try to have at least one hobby that you pursue without your spouse, and encourage your spouse to do the same. It's also healthy for you both to spend some time socializing with your own friends.  , Physical contact is a simple way to show affection to your spouse. Make this a priority, whether you're at home watching television together or out and about. Even the smallest touch of the hand can let your spouse know how much you care.Cuddle often. Try to get in the habit of going to bed at the same time to encourage intimacy. Hold hands while walking. Hug each other every day.  , You and your spouse are bound to have some differences, and you will both be happier if you learn to accept, and even appreciate, those differences.Try to focus on how you and your spouse complement each other, instead of wishing that your spouse was exactly like you. Don't try to change your spouse. This will lead to resentment and conflict.  , No matter how long you and your spouse have been together, it's important to stay in the habit of using words to show your love. Never assume that you don't have to say something because your partner already knows that you care.Say ""good morning"" and ""good night"" every day. Always tell your spouse to have a good day. Say ""I love you"" frequently.  , Happy marriages do not happen by accident. If you want to improve the health of your relationship and make your spouse really happy, you will need to consciously work on the relationship. Always look for areas of conflict and find ways to resolve those conflicts.Resolving conflicts as soon as possible will keep them from growing into bigger issues that could threaten the happiness of your marriage. Keep in mind that no relationship is happy 100% of the time. You will face conflicts, and this is perfectly normal.  , Finances cause many disagreements and arguments in relationships, but they don't have to. Avoid this source of tension by having an open discussion about how you will manage your money as a couple.If money is tight, come up with a budget together that you can both agree upon. Be sure that both you and your spouse are comfortable with how money is managed. If your spouse wants more control over the finances, find a way to make this work.  , Good communication is essential to any happy relationship, so never underestimate its importance. Be sure to share your feelings with your spouse, whether they are positive or negative.If you think there is a problem in the relationship, talk to your spouse about it right away. Encourage your spouse to bring problems up swiftly as well. Check in with your spouse every day to find out how things are going. Try to always be calm and respectful when talking to your spouse. Even if you do not agree, do your best to see things from your spouse's perspective.  , In order to build a strong relationship, you and your spouse must both work on forgiving each other for past offences and trusting each other to respect your marriage. This will help you deal with conflicts in your relationship in a much healthier way.Never hold a grudge, as this will only keep your relationship stuck in the past. Instead, focus on the future. If necessary, go to couples counselling to work on these areas.  , If you really want your spouse to be happy in the marriage, you need to express your love and appreciation. This will let your spouse know that your marriage is a priority to you and that you do not take it for granted, no matter how many other things you have going on it life.Do little things to let your spouse know you care, like sending an ""I love you"" text in the middle of the day or surprising your spouse with breakfast in bed. If you have children, make sure to spend some time alone. While your children are important, they should not be prioritized at the expense of your marriage.

They are likely dealing with an overload of painful symptoms, and coming to terms with their new limitations.The first step is to let them know that you intend to be there for them as a friend. This alone will be a gift to them; many chronically ill are dropped by their friends, who find the problems associated with the illness to be too difficult or uncomfortable. Assure your friend that you will be present in his or her life. Make it clear that you are ready to support your friend as well as you can through difficult times.; , Ask your friend for a good website that will help you to understand exactly what their disease is. Simply googling it may not give you the best of results, as the general search system lacks vital information returns for medical issues. You may wind up with a false impression of the disease, so be sure to ask your friend. It will also be a good step to show them that you care, and have a genuine interest in their health.   You might also like to ask your doctor or a friend with medical qualifications for suggested websites to read through, and perhaps some medical journal articles as well.  , It is likely that your friend is dealing with an enormous amount of pain and new emotions. He or she is probably a mess, and you may find hearing about the state of their lives unpleasant or uncomfortable. This is understandable, however, you must work to put those feelings aside in order to support your friend. You may feel tempted to quickly change the subject. You may not want to meet their eyes. Little in this world is more obvious or more hurtful. So be prepared, but make it clear that you are ready to listen when they want to talk.  , When your friend talks, be a good listener. Make eye contact, let them speak without interrupting, and nod every now and then. When they finish, reply to what they said––do not start talking about something else in your life. You can be certain that your life's problems are completely unrelated.   For example: Your friend says, ""It's so hard. Everything hurts, all the time. I'm so tired sometimes I can barely breathe. I was so nauseated this morning I thought my stomach might explode."" Do not respond with: ""Oh, that sucks. When I ate this burrito from this Mexican place, I was super nauseated too. Have you tried coffee?""  The more appropriate response would be something along the lines of: ""Wow. I'm so sorry, that must be really hard for you."" Validate what they are feeling, and give them permission to talk as much as they need. If you are doing this much already, you are a truly exceptional friend!    , Somebody who is chronically ill finds everyday tasks challenging. Something like showering or making dinner might take every bit of energy that they have in them. Show up with dinner, offer to do their grocery shopping when you are at the store, or offer to drive them somewhere that they may need to go. You don't need to become their caretaker, but dropping off a casserole once a month would go a very long way. Your friend needs a lot of help, but will probably be careful not to ask you for too much.  , You can bake them a cake, bring some movies to their house to watch together, or send them a cute balloon. Offer to go to support groups with them, to better understand what they are going through. Gestures like these can make somebody's day.  , For example, if you make plans, be aware that they may need to cancel suddenly. Don't hold it against them. If they cancel on your lunch plans, understand that they may not have been able to leave the house for weeks. It's possible that they can't go out because they don't have the strength to bathe. They live very different lives. So, if you are cancelled on suddenly, or they aren't responding to your messages, don't be upset. Try to think what they might be going through, and ask them if you can do anything to help. It might be a good time to drop off that casserole! Everybody needs somebody looking after them. Chronic illnesses often put strain in families, so you, as the empathetic friend, may find yourself in the position of being the sole caring person. You are very important.  , Imagine what your day consists of: you probably wake up, take a shower, wash your face, brush your teeth, make yourself breakfast, eat, and get dressed, all before going to work or school. Each of these actions is probably effortless and mindless for you, but any one of them would present an enormous challenge for somebody who is extremely ill. It is impossible to truly understand what that life is like if you have not lived it, but try to imagine the worst illness you have ever had. Preferably one that put you in constant pain, gave you frightening new symptoms, and drained you completely of energy. Now imagine that you never recovered. Think of the long term consequences on your career, your relationships, and your emotions.  , Attempt to understand their limitations. Do your best to get a good understanding of what they are living with and the daily challenges that they face. Many sick people find that others do not want to hear about their illness, so your desire to understand will put them at ease. You may also feel uncomfortable about asking, maybe because you feel that they don't want to talk, or you don't know how to handle the answer. The fact is, most sick people do want to talk about their illnesses. Illness is life for a sick person! People want to talk about their lives. If you don't know how to handle the answer, simply listen well and express empathy for the other person. That's all they need.  , Be assured, this is most likely not a reflection on your personality, but a reflection on how ill your new friend is. If your friend cancelled on your movie plans, offer to come over with movies. It's possible that they can't leave the house. If they say no, don't worry, because it's possible that they simply cannot bathe themselves. If they take a long time to respond to your messages, it's possible that they are not capable of responding. It might be a good time to drop off a casserole or something, if you know the person well enough.   If you ever feel hurt, put yourself in their shoes. Friendship is an enormous energy expenditure for a sick person, and you should take it as a compliment that they are even attempting one with you. It means that think you're worth their precious reserves of energy. You're pretty cool.  , In this case, offer to pick up groceries for them when you are at the store. Contact them, saying that you accidentally made a double batch of macaroni and cheese, and would they want you to drop some off? Eventually, they may feel comfortable asking you for the help that they need to get to doctors' appointments and do other things. They will be careful not to overburden you, and probably will not ask for any help at all unless you take the first step. These small things are not small to somebody in the position of your friend, and they will be remembered for a long time to come.  , Let's say your lovely friend is feeling down. They just saw a doctor who was unkind, or got back some bad lab results. Time to cheer them up! Make yourself available to empathize. Listen to what they have to say, and respond by validating their emotions. For example, when they say: ""I'm really disappointed, I had no idea how much I was hoping for this until it was gone,"" You say, ""I'm so sorry, Bobert. Is there anything I can do?"" Don't respond with your feelings, or attempt to convince them that their problems are not so terrible. Their problems are terrible, and it is helpful if you acknowledge that and provide comfort.  , Want to go the extra mile in friendly kindness? Your friend is so lucky. Bake your friend a cake, send them a balloon, or go to their house (having confirmed it with them first) with a favorite book or movies. Offer to attend a support group with them, and they will feel particularly grateful to have such a caring and thoughtful friend.

When the fear response is activated, your nervous and adrenal systems become aroused, which produces physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes. When a threat is perceived, your autonomic nervous system is activated. This system is controlled by the amygdala.There are several theories that state that anxiety and fear are different in that fear is the emotional expression of a threat or anxiety response, but how exactly the physiological response is translated into emotion is largely based on several theories which involve amygdala, hypothalamus, and cortex.; , The fear response is the body’s natural way of dealing with a fearful situation. It also helps you in coping during stressful times. Having this type of reaction or having fear is not bad, because it helps us to adapt during very stressful times. However, when the fear response is activated in a situation where it is not needed, such as taking a test, you may experience physiological changes including muscle tension, restlessness, and increased heart rate. You might also have psychological changes, which can include trouble concentrating, irritability, or diminished judgment.Keep track of things that make you fearful or worried. Do you see themes? For example, are you constantly worried or anxious about your health, or money? Understanding what triggers your fear responses will help you figure out how to overcome them., Having fear is a biological response to an outside stimulus. Therefore, it cannot be taken away completely. Thus, having NO fear at all is not a very attainable goal. However, fear does become a problem when it is disproportionate to what you are experiencing or when it keeps you from trying new things. Make your goal to change how you perceive fearful stimuli, instead of getting rid of your natural fear response.  , It is very easy to listen to thoughts that warn us about danger. Sometimes these thoughts keep us safe. But when these thoughts keep you from living to your fullest, you can test and challenge these fear statements. Your thoughts will be different depending on what makes you afraid. Possible scenarios can include having a test or speech coming up, or being afraid of social situations. You might also be afraid to take a leap such as going back to school or applying for a new job. Test your thoughts to see if your fear is out of proportion to the situation.   For example, you might be afraid to give a speech. You think that you will freeze up during the speech and embarrass yourself. Test out this thought by asking yourself the following questions: “What is the evidence for this thought?” “Does this thought always hold true for you?” “Does this thought take into account the positive and negative possibilities of the situation?”    , You can further rationalize by telling yourself that you do not know what the future holds. Reason with yourself to keep your thoughts from making you afraid.Offer yourself soothing supportive statements to calm these fearful thoughts. For example, tell yourself that you’re a capable, strong person who can handle scary circumstances. Remind yourself about how you overcame fear in another situation, and you can overcome your fear now as well.  , Distraction has been shown to be a helpful behavioral response when anxious.Research has shown that using distraction can be a protective factor against anxiety. Although researchers do not know the exact reason why distraction works to defend against anxiety, they think that it is connected to cognitive flexibility in being able to shift focus away from anxious external stimuli or anxious thoughts. In fact, distraction was shown to reduce the risk of developing anxiety, in children. If you are in a new situation, it may be helpful to distract yourself from your fearful thoughts. Your fear thoughts may be keeping you tense and worried in the moment. If you find that you are having trouble addressing and challenging your fear thoughts in the moment, giving yourself a distraction may help temporarily to get through the situation.  For example, if you are giving a speech, distract yourself with your note cards and focus on what you are saying. If you are in a social situation, start a conversation with someone or focus on what is going on around you, such as music or the smell of food.    , Get a hold of your imagination before it runs wild. Many people who experience fear find that their imaginations work overtime to create catastrophic scenarios. Rope in your imagination and force yourself to envision that same scenario in a positive, successful way.For example, if you are scared of giving a speech, spend a few minutes before the speech imagining yourself stepping up to the podium and speaking clearly and confidently. Imagine the audience listening attentively and clapping for you at the end.  , Overcoming fear isn't going to happen completely overnight. Work on making incremental changes.This way, you will slowly make progress forward.   For example, if you're afraid in social situations, take small steps like saying hello to the grocery store clerk and the mail carrier. If you're scared of public speaking, raise your hand in class to make a quick comment.  , Sometimes it is helpful to know that fear is a normal part of everyday life, and we have all felt afraid at one point or another. Talking with a friend can normalize this feeling as well as reduce stress by offering social support. Talking with friends can also reduce tension and stress by having a place to laugh and talk through fearful situations. In fact, research studies have shown that social support is linked to feelings of security, which can increase feelings of self-worth., If you’re finding that your fears are seriously limiting your ability to interact with others, or you feel restricted from doing things you used to enjoy, consider visiting a mental health professional. This person may be able to help you dig into the roots of your fears and figure out strategies for overcoming those fears.  , In some cases, you may be able to overcome fears by trying exposure therapy. In this type of therapy, a person is exposed to their fear in a safe environment. Then, he or she can “unlearn” the fear. For example, one study reduced participants’ phobias of spiders by allowing the participants spend time with tarantulas. They were taught about the spiders’ biology and behavior, and eventually touched the spiders.Exposure therapy can sometimes be detrimental, especially for people who suffer from PTSD.Consult with a mental health professional before starting exposure therapy.  , Look for a support group in your area where you can share your experiences with other people who experience fear. You might find something that is specific, such as a support group to overcome a fear of flying, for example. Or, you might find a support group that addresses fears and anxieties more generally.  , Because fear is intimately linked to a physiological response such as increased heart rate, increased breathing, and sweating,it is important to have ways to help reduce these responses. It’s especially important because these sensations can be uncomfortable and may actually make you feel more afraid or stressed. Controlling your breathing can trigger a calming response, signaling your body to begin to relax and slow breathing and heart rate.When you notice that your anxiety or fear is heightened, try deep breathing from your diaphragm.   Take a full breath to a count of ten and ensure that you breath expands your abdomen, hold it for five seconds, and then exhale for five seconds. Be sure to take two normal breaths in between your deep diaphragm breathing., You can access a calming response by using progressive muscle relaxation. This type of relaxation reduces muscle tension, sending a signal your body to begin relaxing. By tensing and then releasing the tension in your muscles, you can slowing bring your body back to a calm state.   Tighten your muscles for six seconds and then release for six seconds. Pay close attention to how each muscle is relaxing. Work from your head to your toes until you feel your body begin to relax.  , Mindfulness is a way to calm your fearful thoughts by becoming aware of your immediate environment such as your sensations like hearing and body sensations. Similar to challenging unhelpful thoughts, mindfulness can be used to allow your fearful thoughts to move in and out of your awarenesswithout judgment and without allowing these thoughts to evoke an emotional or physical response.   When you notice that your fearful thoughts, or physical fear response is becoming too much, tune into noticing the present moment. Listen to the sounds in the room. Sense the temperature of the room. Notice smells in the room. Keep at it until you produce a calming effect for yourself.In addition to pacifying fear, mindfulness can decrease stress and blood pressure. It can also help you to feel more connected to those around you in the moment.",1501,"['purpose', 'friend', 'progressive muscle relaxation', 'statements', 'breathing', 'therapist', 'thoughts', 'fear response', 'life', 'challenge fearful thinking', 'muscles', 'support group', 'exposure therapy', 'small steps', 'fear']"

For males, it is the other way around. The left hand is what you're born with, and the right is what you've accumulated throughout your life. That being said, you can also choose whichever hand is dominant to be your present/past life hand (the non-dominant hand would then be your future life hand).  There are different schools of thought on the matter. Some say the left-hand shows potential and what could be -- not necessarily what will be. And a difference in the hands could mean one is or is about to take action when it comes to their lives, changing it.; , There may be breaks in them or they may be short, but at least three of them are there.   (1) The heart line (2) The head line (3) The life line (4) The fate line (only some people have this).  , This line can be read in either direction (from the pinkie finger to the index finger or vice versa) depending on the tradition being followed. It's believed to indicate emotional stability, romantic perspectives, depression, and cardiac health. The basic interpretations are as follows:  Begins below the index finger - content with love life       Begins below the middle finger - selfish when it comes to love       Begins in the middle - falls in love easily       Straight and short - less interest in romance       Touches life line - heart is broken easily       Long and curvy - freely expresses emotions and feelings       Straight and parallel to the head line - good handle on emotions       Wavy - many relationships and lovers, absence of serious relationships       Circle on the line - sadness or depression       Broken line - emotional trauma       Smaller lines crossing through heart line - emotional trauma        , This represents a person's learning style, communication approach, intellectualism, and thirst for knowledge. A curved line is associated with creativity and spontaneity, while a straight line is linked with practicality and a structured approach. The basic interpretations are as follows:  Short line - prefers physical achievements over mental ones       Curved, sloping line - creativity       Separated from life line - adventure, enthusiasm for life       Wavy line - short attention span       Deep, long line - thinking is clear and focused       Straight line - thinks realistically       Donuts or cross in head line - emotional crisis       Broken head line - inconsistencies in thought       Multiple crosses through head line - momentous decisions.        , This begins near the thumb and travels in an arc towards the wrist. It reflects physical health, general well-being, and major life changes (for example, cataclysmic events, physical injuries, and recolation). Its length is not associated with length of life. The basic interpretations are as follows:  Runs close to thumb - often tired       Curvy - plenty of energy       Long, deep - vitality       Short and shallow - manipulated by others       Swoops around in a semicircle - strength, and enthusiasm       Straight and close to the edge of the palm - cautious when it comes to relationships       Multiple life lines - extra vitality       Circle in line indicates - hospitalized or injured       Break - sudden change in lifestyle        , This is also known as the line of destiny, and it indicates the degree to which a person's life is affected by external circumstances beyond their control. It begins at the base of the palm. The basic interpretations are as follows:  Deep line - strongly controlled by fate       Breaks and changes of direction - prone to many changes in life from external forces       Starts joined to life line - self-made individual; develops aspirations early on       Joins with the life line around in the middle - signifies a point at which one's interests must be surrendered to those of others       Starts at base of the thumb and crosses life line - support offered by family and friends.        , Each hand shape is associated with certain character traits. The length of the palm is measured from the wrist to the bottom of the fingers. The basic interpretations are as follows:    Earth - broad, square palms and fingers, thick or coarse skin, and ruddy color; length of the palm equals length of fingers  Solid values and energy, sometimes stubborn Practical and responsible, sometimes materialistic Work with their hands, comfortable with the tangible    Air - square or rectangular palms with long fingers and sometimes protruding knuckles, low-set thumbs, and dry skin; length of the palm less than length of fingers  Sociable, talkative and witty Can be shallow, spiteful and cold Comfortable with the mental and the intangible Does things in different and radical ways    Water - long, sometimes oval-shaped palm, with long, flexible, conical fingers; length of the palm equals the length of fingers but is less than the width across the widest part of the palm.  Creative, perceptive and sympathetic Can be moody, emotional and inhibited Introverts Do things quietly and intuitively.    Fire - square or rectangular palm, flushed or pink skin, and shorter fingers; length of the palm is greater than length of fingers  Spontaneous, enthusiastic and optimistic Sometimes egoistic, impulsive and insensitive Extroverts Do things boldly and instinctively.    , That's what the fleshy bit below your fingers are called, on the opposite side of your knuckle. To make them visible, cup your hand just a bit. Which one is the largest?   A high Venus mount (the one under your thumb) indicates a predisposition for hedonism, promiscuity, and the need for instant gratification. A non-existent Venus mount indicates little interest in family matters. The mount under your index finger is called the Jupiter mount. If this is well-developed, it means you are dominant, possibly self-centered, and aggressive. A lack of one means you lack confidence. Under your middle finger is the Saturn mount. A high mount shows you're stubborn, cynical, and prone to depression. If it is low, it's an indicator of superficiality and disorganization. The Sun mount is under your ring finger. You're quick-tempered, extravagant, and prideful if you have a high Sun mount. A low Sun mount means you lack imagination. The Mercury mount is under your pinkie. If it's protruding, you talk too much. A low mount means the opposite -- you're shy.  None of this is based on science. And your hands are known to change throughout time. Don't take any of it too seriously!    , Relative to the size of the body, some say that small hands are active and don't dwell on thinking about what to do. Large hands are on those who are contemplative and slow to action.Remember, this is relative to the body. If you're 8 feet (2.4 m) tall (2.4 m), you're going to have bigger hands than a 4-year-old. It's all proportional. What's more, long fingers may be an indicator of anxiety, in addition to being well-mannered, good looking, and delicate. Short fingers are found on those who are impatient, highly-sexed, and creative. Long fingernails, on the other hand, mean you're kind and a good secret-keeper. Short fingernails mean you're critical and sarcastic. If they're almond-shaped, you're sweet and diplomatic.",1184,"['heart line', 'head line', 'fate line', 'life line', 'hand shape', 'finger size', 'major lines', 'hand']"

Tape will limit your range of motion and may allow more blood to flow to the injured area.You can get trainer’s and kinesiology tape at most pharmacies and sports stores, and even some larger retailers. Some professionals suggest black tape, which may adhere better to sweaty skin.Though duct tape may work in a pinch, as it is as supportive as trainer's tape,duct tape was not meant to be used on skin, and therefore the adhesive is much stronger. If you tape your legs with duct tape, you risk blistering and shearing of the skin.; , Clean any oils, sweat or dirt off your skin with a mild cleanser and some water. Make sure to dry it thoroughly with a towel. Washing and drying your leg can help ensure that the tape adheres effectively to your skin.You can use any kind of mild or simple soap to clean your leg.  , If you don’t want to use an underwrap or are especially hairy, consider shaving your leg(s). Shaving can help the tape adhere better. It can also be less painful to remove the tape from your leg.Make sure to shave carefully so that you don’t cut your skin and cause further injury., If you prefer not to place the tape against your skin, consider placing an underwrap between the tape and your skin. Be aware that using underwraps is not as effective as using tape only.Underwrap and skin adhesives are optional.Simply apply the skin adhesive and the underwrap to the areas of your skin you plan to tape.You can get underwrap and skin adhesive at most pharmacies and possibly some sports stores., Depending on whether you purchase trainer’s or kinesiology tape or strips, you’ll need to cut the tape before you wrap your shin. This can help ensure you use the right amount of tape to effectively treat your shin splints and will keep you from wasting.Cut pieces of your tape to a length of 12–18 inches (45.7 cm) depending on how tall you are. If you are smaller, use less tape, and if you are taller, use more.Round the edges of the tape for easier application.Remove any backing from the tape before you wrap your shin., Flexing your foot can help the tape stay on your skin more effectively. Once you’ve done this, place one end of your tape on the top of your foot just below your pinky toe.Flex your foot to a 45 degree angle., From the top of your foot by your pinky toe, wrap the tape under your foot and then across your arch at the highest point, angling the tape upwards towards your skin.The tape should be taught but not tight. You don’t want to cut off your circulation.If your skin gets very red or starts to throb, you may have wrapped it too tightly., Wrap the tape in a diagonal fashion upwards across the front of the leg. You can tape your entire shin or just the areas affected with shin splints.Tape around the leg two more times, overlapping each previous band of tape slightly. The tape should cross over the part of your shin that is in pain.Do not wrap your calf muscle., Walk around before exercising. If the tape is too tight, remove it and repeat the taping process, wrapping the tape more loosely in the same fashion.  , In addition to basic shin taping, you can try a couple of other different taping methods. These may be more effective than basic taping for your shin splints.Wrap using the “X” arch taping method by holding your foot at a 90-degree angle with your toes curled slightly downward.Use one strip of tape around the ball of your foot as an anchor. Place additional strips of tape at the base of each toe and extend them up your shin. You can opt to put tape strips around the arch of your foot for added support.Wrap using the “lateral taping” method by starting tape at the front area of the ankle and continuing to wrap it around the back. Then wrap the tape up the outer calf and shin area at a 45-degree angle. Repeat this process four times for a support., After you’re leg begins to feel better or once you’re done exercising, take the tape off of your shin and foot. This can help your skin breathe and keep it from getting infected.   If you chose to not shave your legs before taping, you may experience some discomfort.  , Give you body a chance to rest or switch to lighter activities. Immobility and/or doing lower-impact activities can help heal your shin splints.If you do high-impact activities such as running or tennis, switch to lower-impact options. You can try biking, walking, or swimming to stay active while giving your legs a rest.You may also want to rest your legs completely for a while.Begin gently moving the affected area if you take a few days of full rest to help prevent stiffness unless it causes too much pain., Use an ice pack on the painful area of your shin. This can help reduce swelling and relieve pain.You can use an ice pack as often as necessary for 20 minutes at a time.You can take a slush bath by mixing ice and water in a bathtub. Soak your legs for up to 20 minutes.You can freeze a plastic foam cup full of water to gently massage the affected area.If it is too cold or your skin gets numb, remove the pack., Consume pain relievers for severe discomfort and/or as necessary. These medications may help alleviate pain and possible swelling.Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or acetaminophen.Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium may also help alleviate some of the swelling.Aspirin should not be taken by anyone under 18 without a doctor's permission, due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.  , If home treatment and other options don’t relieve your shin splints, see your doctor. Shin splints are very common and very treatable, and getting a medical diagnosis can help you get proper treatment.You can see your regular doctor or visit an orthopedist, who specializes in treating disorders such as shin splints.Your doctor will conduct a physical exam to check for signs of shin splints and will also likely ask for a health history, including factors such as what type of activities you do and what type of shoes you wear., Choose footwear that is appropriate for your sport and activity level. This can help ensure that your foot and legs have proper support and cushioning. It may also help prevent shin splints.For example, if you run on roads, get shoes with ample cushion. In addition, replace your shoes about every 350 to 500 miles (560 to 800 kilometers).Most sports stores and specialty stores can help you find the right shoes for your activity.  , Think about wearing supports in your shoes. Arch supports can help prevent the pain of shin splints, especially if you have flat arches.You can get arch supports at many pharmacies and most sports stores.  , Try cross-training with lower impact sports, such as swimming, walking or biking. This can help relieve shin splints while staying active and may help prevent future bouts of them.Be sure to begin new activities slowly and increase them gradually., Shin splints may occur when your shin and/or calf muscles are weak. Add some strength training exercises to help strengthen your calf muscles. This may also help prevent getting shin splints in the future.Toe raises may help strengthen your calves and prevent shin splints. Stand up and slowly rise up on your toes. Hold for two seconds and then slowly lower back to the ground. Repeat 10 times or as many times as you can.As you get stronger, you can add weights to toe raises.Leg presses and leg extension may also help with shin splints.",1322,"['foot', 'rest', 'time', 'doctor', 'arch', 'shin splints', 'ice', 'tape application', 'shin', 'right shoes', 'impact activities', 'pain medication', 'methods', 'affected area', 'application', 'purchase tape', 'tape', 'leg', 'underwrap', 'strength training sessions']"

You may notice that the coughing is worse at night or when he's resting. Coughing is usually caused by fluid buildup in the lungs.Coughing may also be a result of an enlarged heart pushing up on your dog's windpipe.; , If your dog is short of breath because of a heart condition, he'll breathe quickly. The lungs may be filled with fluid and his breaths may seem shallow and rapid. This is because the ability of his lungs to absorb oxygen is compromised.   Normally, a large-breed dog takes up to 25 breaths a minute at rest., If you take your dog for a run, check to see if he lags behind. The increased demands on the heart to pump blood throughout the body will cause your dog to slow down or even faint when he exercises. You should also check his heart rate to see if it's racing.   German Shepherds should have a heart rate of around 80 to 120 beats a minute. If your dog's heart is beating faster than this, it's considered to be racing, especially if he's not exercising at the time., In addition to not being excited about exercising, your German Shepherd may seem lethargic. This is because his heart is putting strain on the rest of his body to function. Your dog might not want attention and may even seem depressed.For example, your once playful dog may suddenly want to be on his own and resist going for walks.  , Look for a swollen and enlarged abdomen which is a sign that fluid is building up in the belly (distended belly). This fluid accumulates because the right side of the heart is struggling.You may also notice the membranes in your dog's mouth look blue or purple, instead of healthy pink.  , It's always important to watch for any weight loss or gain in your German Shepherd. Weight loss might be caused by your dog losing his appetite because of an underlying medical condition (like heart disease). Weight gain may also be caused by heart disease, even if it's less likely a symptom.It may be hard to tell if your dog has gained weight or is experiencing edema. Edema happens when your dog's tissues swell.  , Severe symptoms of heart disease in a German Shepherd may appear with no warning. These include fainting, collapse, or even sudden death. These may happen if your dog's heart can't pump enough blood to his brain.If your dog faints, the veterinarian may be able to prescribe medication to make his breathing easier. Don't wait to get medical treatment for your German Shepherd.  , If your German Shepherd has any symptoms of heart disease, take him to see the veterinarian. It's best to catch heart disease early on so you have more treatment options. Your veterinarian may recommend that you take your dog to a specialist for a specific diagnosis.   Since heart disease symptoms are similar even for a variety of diseases, it's important to get a proper diagnosis.  , The veterinarian will do a physical exam to check your German Shepherd's general body condition. Specifically, the vet will check your dog's pulse and use a stethoscope to listen to his lungs and heart. The vet will listen for heart murmurs which are caused by abnormal blood flow in the heart and for heart rhythm.   The vet will try to identify where the heart murmur is loudest. This can help determine what's causing the abnormal blood flow.  , If the vet hears no heart murmur or irregular heart beat, but suspects heart disease, your dog may need a proBNP blood test. This test shows the levels of a certain heart protein in your dog's blood stream. The higher the level means your dog's heart is distressed.If your dog has low levels of proBNP, this can rule out heart disease.  , If the vet does hear an irregular heartbeat, your dog may need an electrocardiogram (ECG). This records the electrical activity in the heart which are interpreted alongside an ultrasound scan of the heart. This way, the vet can check the electrical activity against a picture of your dog's heart to see how the heart valves close. The vet can measure the thickness of the heart walls and check for tumors or abnormalities within the heart.A skilled ultrasonographer can also see abnormal blood vessels or recognize blood vessels which are narrower than they should be. This can help make a diagnosis. The ultrasonographer can also use a color-mode on the scan to watch the flow of blood through the heart. This helps identify where blood is flowing incorrectly and in what volumes.  , Your German Shepherd may have a hard time pumping blood throughout his body if his aorta is deformed. The aorta is the main artery leaving the heart. If the valve into the aorta is narrowed, as in AS, a backpressure is created in the heart making your dog work harder to circulate blood.Medication is the most common treatment for AS, which treats the irregular heart rhythm and may include antibiotics to prevent infection. Surgery is not recommended., Your German Shepherd may have a heart deformity that's causing a heart murmur or another health condition (like problems eating or with blood circulation). These deformities may include:   Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA): This is a temporary blood vessel in a fetal puppy that should close shortly after he's born. If it stays open, blood may bypass your dog's lungs. Vascular ring anomaly (also known as persistent right aortic arch): This is another blood vessel that should close before your dog is born. If it stays open after birth, the vessel traps your dog's esophagus which makes it hard for him to swallow food down into his stomach.Mitral or tricuspid valve disease: These valves separate the heart's atria from the ventricles. If they don't fit perfectly together, then blood can leak in the wrong direction, causing a heart murmur.  , If your dog has abnormalities in the heart muscle itself, he may have dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. With Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the heart muscle tires and becomes baggy. With hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle thickens, causing the chambers to get smaller and hold less blood.Treatment usually focuses on improving your dog's diet and exercise habits. Most vets don't recommend surgery unless your German Shepherd develops congestive heart failure.  , Older German Shepherds are prone to a vascular tumor (hemangiosarcoma) that attacks the vessels lining the heart. This tumor is the most common type in dogs and usually isn't noticed until it gets big enough to cause complications. Your dog may have abdominal swelling, irregular heartbeat, and anemia.Treatment for hemangiosarcoma is difficult. Veterinarians usually recommend chemotherapy and possibly draining the site of the tumor. Because the tumor is on the heart, treatment may only be able to add a few months to your dog's life.",1155,"['tumor', 'heart disease', 'dog', 'heart defects', 'medical attention', 'shortness', 'severe signs', 'aortic stenosis', 'belly', 'changes', 'breath', 'behavior', 'weight', 'german shepherd', 'cardiomyopathy', 'additional testing', 'blood test']"

How To Set Up and Use Your IDE (Integrated Development Environment): This tutorial assumes you have already set up your IDE to work with the SDL and SDL_image libraries. In addition, you should already know how to compile, debug, and execute programs from within your IDE.   Warning: All IDE's are different and need to be linked to libraries and include files differently. If you have never worked with external libraries and include files before try reading through the documentation of your preferred IDE for information on how to accomplish this.  ; , In order to use SDL you will only be including two files at the beginning of your .cpp file: SDL.h and SDL_image.h.   Your includes should be before your main() function and should look like the following:   Tip: If SDL functions are not defined in your compiler after including SDL.h and SDL_image.h make sure you have told your compiler where to look for them!    , If you are not used to passing arguments through your main function then the style of the main when using SDL may be new to you. For simplicity's sake this wikiHow will not use these arguments, but they still need to be there to compile correctly.   The opening of your main() function should look like the following:   Tip: Typically int argc would be the number of strings being passed, and char **argv would be the strings being passed to your main via command line.    , This project will only be using two primitive data types and two SDL specific data types; we will use one char* that will be set to the path of the image you would like to display (we could also use a string for the image path, but the char* makes this a little more straight forward), one bool which will be used as a sentinel in out event loop later on, one SDL_Event variable for our event loop, and two SDL_Surface variables -- one for our screen, and one for our image.   Your variables should be placed within your main() function, and should look like the following:   Tip: Make sure imagePath is the exact path to your image in relation to where your .cpp is located.    , In order to use SDL we must first initialize it. Although it is not necessary to compile, it is standard practice to attempt to initialize SDL and upon failure throw an error and return a value to end the main function. This makes debugging a lot easier and is good programming practice.   This is how SDL should be initialized within your main() function:   Tip: Writing your error message to a file may be more advantageous in the future as your projects grow in size.    , In order to display an image we first have to load the image into memory. This is done is SDL using the IMG_Load function. Much like when we initialized SDL we want to attempt to load our image, but upon failure we want to throw an error and return a value to the main function. This time we also want to quit SDL using the SDL_Quit() function since we have previously initialized SDL.   Place the following code within your main() function to load your image into memory:   Tip: If this results in a failure it is likely your imagePath is incorrect.    , To set up the screen surface is a little more complicated because there are many options for setting up your screen; you can set this up as full screen, hardware rendered, software rendered, etc. But for this tutorial we will use a simple setup by using the width and height of our previously loaded image and pass the SDL_ANYFORMAT flag to let SDL do the work for us.   Much like the previous steps we want to handle a failure by calling SDL_Quit() and returning a value to main, but this time we want to add an extra argument. Since we allocated memory when we set up the image, if the program fails at this point we have to call SDL_FreeSurface to free the memory allocated to image in order to avoid a memory leak. Place the following code within your main() function to initializing the SDL surface:  , An event loop is not necessary for displaying an image, but it allows us to keep the image on the screen until we want it to close. In the example here the image will stay on the screen until we press a key on the keyboard.   In order to display the image we will first use SDL_BlitSurface to stick the two surfaces and SDL_Flip to display the image. This is also where our sentinel value comes into play; we will continue in our loop until the SDL_Quit event is caught (the user closes the window). Once the user closes the window we set the sentinel to false which will meet the condition for the loop to exit. The following code for the event loop should be placed within your main() function:  , At this point we have displayed our image and all is well. But if we were to just stop here we would create a memory leak because the memory we allocated for our image was never freed. So we must remember to end our program by freeing the surface and for good measure quit SDL using the SDL_Quit function.   Place the following code at the end of your main() function  , Now that we are done with the fun part it's time to see if your code will actually compile and run.   There is a chance that you will get build errors; this is likely due to a typo somewhere in the code. If you get a build error double check the code to make sure you didn't miss anything.

You will need enough clay to cover the surface area of the pumpkin you wish to create, as well as enough to create a stem.Because you probably won’t be able to find mass amounts of orange clay, you can purchase white clay and use paint to color it accordingly.; , This will be used twice for this project. Unless you have orange clay handy, you will probably be working with white polymer clay. To create the orange color for the pumpkin and the brown color for the stem, you will need to dye the clay with acrylic paint. Additionally, after the clay dries, you can add more color and detailing to your pumpkin (and stem) by painting it again with acrylic paint.Don’t forget to purchase a few paintbrushes, if you don’t have any.  , You probably already have these at home, and you’ll need them for this project. Look for heavy-duty paper like a paper bag. This will be used to create the form of the pumpkin. You will need enough foil and plastic wrap to cover the surface of the pumpkin, whatever size you choose to make it., You will be creating the pumpkins and stems separately. This makes them easier to mold and paint. You will need some glue to attach the stem to the pumpkin, and you want it to be a sturdy bond. Mixed media glue works well for this.Your local craft store will have some. If you’re not sure if a glue will work to attach polymer clay together, ask!  , To make sure your beautiful, homemade pumpkin holds up, you’ll want to seal it. While the acrylic paint will be pretty durable, it can be good to add a second coat of protection if these decorations are going to be put in storage for part of the year. For this project, you’ll need to purchase a polyurethane varnish, which works well on polymer clay projects.Depending on the look you want for your pumpkins, you can choose sealants with a matte or shiny finish.  , Making the entire pumpkin out of one dense ball of polymer clay would require a lot of clay. Instead, you’re going to create the form of the pumpkin with your paper! Roll a couple of pieces or strips of your paper into a ball about the size that you want your pumpkin.Don’t worry – it doesn’t have to look perfect. Just get the paper rolled up as best you can!  , The paper ball will start unraveling the moment you take your hands off of it. The aluminum foil will hold it in shape. Once you’ve molded a piece of aluminum foil around your paper ball, you can start to mold it into more of a pumpkin shape. This is the pumpkin form that will create the base of your clay project.The great thing about pumpkins is that they’re naturally bumpy, so don’t worry about trying to make it perfectly smooth.  , It’s important to not start working with the clay until you’re ready to use it, because no bake polymer clay will start slowly drying out once it’s out of the package. Grab as much as you think you will need to cover your pumpkin form. Warm it up by kneading it in your hands, and then add a few drops of the orange acrylic paint into the clay. Then, continue kneading until the paint has mixed into the white clay and you’re left with orange clay. The more orange paint you add, the darker orange your clay will be.Your hands will get a bit messy during this step. If you want to use gloves you certainly can. Otherwise, you can clean your hands when you’re finished with a bit of soap and water., After you’ve gotten your clay to a shade of orange you’re happy with, it’s time to roll it out. You can use a rolling pin for this step, or any cylindrical object with a smooth surface. Place your clay on the surface you’re working on, and use your rolling tool to stretch and flatten it out. Continue going until you’ve created a flat piece of clay large enough to cover the pumpkin form you created.Don’t roll the clay paper thin, or it could break or tear as you wrap it around the pumpkin form.  , Place the center of your clay slab on the top of the pumpkin. Then, carefully fold and wrap the sides over the rest of the pumpkin, making sure everything is fully covered. Once you’re satisfied with the placement, begin smoothing it out. Blend the places where edges of clay meet, being careful not to tear the clay.No bake polymer clay can start to get dry as you work with it. Keep a small cup of water at your workstation so you can wet your fingers while you work with the clay.  , Take a new piece of polymer clay out of the package, and repeat the dying process to make it brown. Then, roll out three pieces of the brown clay along your flat, creating tubes or strands of clay. Cut the tubes into small sections, whatever length you want your pumpkin stem to be.Once you’ve created your pieces, grab three or four of them and gently press them together. Gently knead and roll the pieces together so that they dry together, but still have the appearance of distinct strands of clay stuck together. This will create the dimensional, ridged look of a real pumpkin stem. Flatten the stem at the end, where it will attach to your pumpkin.  , Once you have wrapped your clay around the form and you’re satisfied with how it looks, it’s time to add the ridges and grooves. However, you want to make sure that you don’t tear the clay, which would expose the aluminum foil, and you don’t want pieces of clay to get stuck to your tools. To avoid this, wrap the pumpkin in plastic wrap. Now, you can add your texture details with less chance of clay getting stuck or ripping., Real pumpkins aren’t smooth, so this is an important step to make it look realistic. You can use anything from a pencil to a dull knife to add these details. Start from the top of our pumpkin and bring your tool all the way to the bottom, creating long vertical lines. You can add as many as you like, but remember, the clay will start drying so it’s important to work efficiently. You will not be able to change the shape of the clay later., After you've created the ridges and you're satisfied with the texture of the sides of the pumpkin, you'll need to add a bit of detail to the top. The stem will need a flat surface to be glued to. Using your fingers, gently press down on the top to form a little indent that will fit the stem. Place the stem to the top of the pumpkin to ensure it fits properly.  , If you are satisfied with the colors of your clay after it has dried, you can skip this step. However, some people like to touch up their clay with a fresh coat of paint or a little bit of detailing. Grab your acrylic paints and your brushes, and start painting however you want. You can use a light orange around the entire pumpkin and fill in the ridges with a darker shade of orange, or you can keep everything one color. You can paint the stem brown or add a bit of green. This part is totally up to you, so get creative!   Remember, the paint doesn’t need to be perfect and even. Pumpkins are naturally textured and different colors, so embrace a little bit of mess.  , It will feel dry to the touch pretty soon after painting, but it’s best to let it sit overnight. The surface of the paint will dry faster than the full coat, so play it safe and give it some extra time. You don’t want to risk messing any of your painting up by handling it too soon., Once your paint is completely dry, it’s time to attach your stem to your pumpkin. The easiest way to do this is by adding a dollop of your mixed media glue to the top of your pumpkin. Then, press your stem firmly into the glue, adjusting it until you’re satisfied with its position. Wipe off any excess glue.Give the glue a couple of hours to dry. Even after the glue is dry, avoid picking up your pumpkins by the stems, just to be safe.  , You can do this before the glue is dry. Applying the sealant is the final touch, and it will blend your stem and pumpkin together by adding one, cohesive finish. It will also protect your pumpkins from any wear and tear. Spray over the entire pumpkin and stem, and let them dry overnight. Now, it’s time to find a spot in your home for your gorgeous homemade pumpkins!",1530,"['plastic wrap', 'acrylic paint', 'strong glue', 'bake polymer clay', 'papers', 'aluminum foil', 'clay', 'vertical grooves', 'pumpkin form', 'pumpkin', 'orange clay', 'top', 'paper', 'stem', 'paper ball', 'ball', 'sealant']"

This is usually allowed to happen by breaking a pi bond or bonding to a set of unpaired electrons in the molecule. Addition reactions do not “swap” one atom or group for another. They just add something new.Addition reactions usually happen when double or triple bonds are attacked. For example, if a double bond is present between two carbons, and if hydrogen was added across the bond, it would result in hydrogen being added to the molecule. No other species would leave.; , This is the opposite of an addition reaction. Something will be taken away from the original molecule and leave behind electrons. These unbound electrons will either show up as a lone pair or form a pi bond in the molecule.If you remove hydrogen from a hydrocarbon chain, the result would be that the unpaired electrons go into a double bond between two of the carbons. This does not require anything else to be added, it only removes the hydrogen.  , A substitution reaction occurs when some group (A) on the molecule is removed and replaced by some new group (B). This does not necessarily change the number of pi or sigma bonds in the molecule, as you would see with addition and elimination reactions. Common types of substitution reactions are:Nucleophilic Substitution ― When one nucleophile replaces another nucleophile in the reaction. Electrophilic Substitution ― When one electrophile replaces another electrophile in the reaction. SN1 ― A substitution reaction that involves only one molecule in the transition state. In other words, the leaving group leaves first, and then the new group is free to attack the molecule.SN2 ― In this type of reaction, the transition state is formed from two molecules. This happens because the new group attacks the molecule at an available site, and the leaving group is forced to fall away., Rearrangements form isomers ― molecules that have exactly the same atoms present but in a different configuration. Isomers will have the same chemical formula, but different properties that are unique to their configuration. The number of bonds is usually unaffected in rearrangements, as well.There is a subset of rearrangement reactions know as tautomerization. This is when two isomers rapidly flip back and forth between each other.  , Oxidation-reduction (or Redox) reactions are very common in organic chemistry, as are radical reactions. You should be somewhat familiar with these reactions from general inorganic chemistry, but it is a good idea to review them. If you continue your pursuit of organic chemistry, you will encounter more complicated reactions that occur under specialized conditions, but they will follow the same basic foundations as all organic reactions., The word electrophile refers to “electron-loving” species. This applies to atoms, molecules, and ions. If it can accept an electron pair, it is considered an electrophile. Just remember that not all electrophiles attract electrons with the same intensity. Electrophiles with higher electronegativities will attract electrons better than those with lower electronegativities.Cations are good examples of electrophiles. Since they have a positive net charge, they are attracted to the negative charge of an electron. Halogens (Chlorine, Fluorine, etc.) are also strong electrophiles, since acquiring one electron will fill their outermost electron shell, making them more stable overall.  , Nucleophiles are the perfect compliment to electrophiles. A nucleophile is any species that is capable of donating a pair of electrons. Species with lower electronegativities will be more able to donate electrons, thus making them better nucleophiles than species with higher electronegativities.Anions boast a negative charge overall, and are often able to give up electrons in order to become more stable. This usually happens via ionic bonding. Alkali earth metals such as sodium also tend to be nucleophilic in nature since giving away an electron will stabilize their outermost electron shell.  , This is, in essence, just a way of looking at mechanisms consistently. You should read your mechanism as if the nucleophilic compound seeks out and reacts with the electrophilic compound. This will help you to remember where to start and where the electrons are going.   An example of this might be that you have a molecule containing a double bond between two of its carbons (pi electrons are usually able to form another bond with a new species), and a bromine (halogen) molecule attacks that double bond. The result would be that the double bond would be broken, and the bromine would be added to one of the two carbons (which carbon depends on the conditions and type of reaction).  , While organic chemistry is a huge subject, there are important underlying principles that govern the more complex reactions. If you become familiar with these principles and understand their applications, you will be able to see how they play out in the most complex set of organic reactions. Some of the most important foundations are:Stereochemistry ― This refers to the way that the shape and size of a molecule affects its reactivity.Resonance ― This is when a molecule has different possible electron configurations. For example, an electron pair could be found in a double bond or on a close by functional group. This flexibility provides stabilization for the molecule.Aromatization ― This takes the delocalization of electrons seen in resonance (the ability of electrons to be shared across the molecule) to a different level. In an aromatic molecule there are always (4n+2) pi electrons and they are delocalized across a conjugated pi bond system or in a ring (such as benzene).Functional Groups ― These groups of atoms are responsible for different characteristics of the molecules that they are attached to.  , This will allow you to preview the information that will be covered in lectures. You should take notes on what you read and make sure that they correspond to the notes you take during lecture. You should also write down any questions that you have while reading, and ask them if the lecture doesn’t answer them for you.  , You will benefit greatly by breaking the large amounts of information covered in an organic chemistry class down into notecards. The system you use for your notecards will depend on what information you wish to learn at the time. Do not throw away your note cards. Keep them to review each week, and you will be much better off for the final exam.For example, you could make a set of notecards for a series of addition reactions that you are studying. Likewise, you could make a set of notecards that cover the different types of reactions (addition, elimination, substitution, etc.). You could make several sets of notecards, such as the two mentioned, that organize the information in different ways.  , Research shows that cramming all of your studying into one massive session is not very effective. You will learn a lot more if you spread out your study time. Remember to take a study break every forty-five minutes to rest your brain.Be sure that you go back and review past material material each week. This will keep the material fresh, and can be done easily by reviewing your notecards.  , Even if you prefer to study alone, a is where you will discover different ways to look at organic reactions. Other students might be great at determining which reactions are SN1 or SN2, while you are better at identifying nucleophiles and electrophiles. This exchange of knowledge will benefit everyone.Another way to approach social learning is to tutor someone else, or find a tutor yourself.  , Working through practice problems will force your brain to recall the information that you have learned. This is a vital skill for taking the test. It is also a good idea to time yourself so that you can get faster at working problems. Try taking practice tests and work on completing them in the same amount of time that you will have in class.",1320,"['semester', 'formula', 'time', 'spot rearrangement reactions', 'different organic reactions', 'nucleophiles attack electrophiles', 'product', 'number', 'elimination reactions', 'organic chemistry', 'foundations', 'class', 'electrophiles', 'sigma bonds', 'nucleophiles', 'original molecule', 'organic reactions', 'practice problems', 'organic chemistry reaction mechanisms', 'addition reactions', 'book', 'organic molecules', 'group', 'substitution reactions', 'day', 'pi bonds', 'important reactions', 'study organic chemistry', 'notecards']"

As a result, eliminating tobacco from your life can definitely reduce the risk of throat cancer.   Common tobacco products include: cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco. Long-term use of tobacco products can increase risk of throat cancer exponentially. Some studies have shown that even short-term use of tobacco products can increase risk of throat cancer substantially over individuals who have never used tobacco.; , Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can increase the chance of throat cancer. As a result, if you are a heavy drinker, you should try to decrease consumption as soon as possible. Consider:   Even moderate alcohol consumption, such as more than one drink per day, may increase your chances of throat cancer. If you have questions about what is considered “excessive” consult your doctor. If you feel like you need to cut down or need and “eye opener” in the morning, then you may have a problem with alcohol.  People who drink too much and use tobacco products have the highest risk level., Another major risk of throat cancer is the human papillomavirus infection (HPV). HPV is transmitted through vaginal and oral sex. In recent years, studies have shown that throat cancer is sometimes linked to HPV. In order to decrease your risk of throat cancer, practice safe and informed sex.   If you are in a relationship with someone with HPV, avoid high-risk sexual activities (that may transmit HPV from the genitals to your mouth and throat) like oral sex. HPV can increase your risk of getting certain types of cancer (like throat cancer) by 22 times., Acid reflux and related illnesses are another major risk factor for throat cancer. This is due to the fact that over long periods of time, acid splash back from the stomach causes skin cells in the throat and esophagus to change into cells that are more prone to cancer.   Take over-the-counter medicine that helps reduce acid in your stomach. Consume a diet that does not aggravate your reflux. Avoid fried foods, high-fat foods, and citrus. Focus on most fresh fruits and vegetables, meats like chicken and fish, and other low-fat foods. Actively manage your reflux with your medical profession. Do not let long periods of bad reflux occur without consulting your doctor., Poor nutrition and a lack of vitamins and other nutrients in your diet can increase your chances of throat cancer. This is because without certain vitamins and nutrients, your body will not have what it needs to fight off cancer cells in their early stages.   Eat lots of green, leafy vegetables and consume a wide array of vegetables and fruits. These contain antioxidants which help to fight against cancer. Those who eat more fruits and vegetables have been show to have a lower risk of throat cancer than those who eat more meats and nitrates. Take vitamin supplements. Consult your physician about a proper diet if you have concerns., Secondhand smoke is another leading cause of throat cancer. While many people quit smoking or never smoke in the first place, they can still get cancer because they’ve had long term exposure to secondhand smoke.   Encourage family and friends to quit smoking. Avoid sitting in smoking sections in public accommodations, like restaurants and sports stadiums. Disassociate with people who smoke around you despite your requests for them to not. After all, your health is more important than a friendship or association with someone who does not care about your well-being., Studies have identified a wide variety of chemicals that increase the chances of cancer, including throat cancer. As a result, you need to be vigilant in your work environment and pay attention to what chemicals and fumes you work with on a daily basis.   If you work in an industrial setting, make sure your employer provides proper ventilation and other safety equipment. If you are in construction or a similar field, make sure you handle all materials in an appropriate fashion and follow government guidelines and regulations. If you work in a newly renovated building or an older building with potential environmental issues, be aware of any potential issues or hazards. Always be concerned and proactive. Do not trust that your employer is following the law or has your safety as their number one priority. If you have any specific concerns, review Material Safety Data Sheets for your certain products and substances provided on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's website (www.osha.gov)., Poor dental health is another potential risk factor for throat cancer. Risks are increased considerably if you do not maintain proper oral hygiene because bacteria will build up in your mouth. In addition, poor dental health will increase risk of cavities and other health problems — some of which have been connected with throat cancer.   Make sure to floss regularly — every day. Brush your teeth twice a day. Have your teeth professionally cleaned on an annual or semiannual basis., Pollution in the environment around us is also a cause of throat cancer. As a result, make sure to be aware of your surroundings — where you live, work, and recreate.   If you live near a coal power plant or an industry that contributes to air pollution, you may be at higher risk. If you live next to a major road or interstate, you could be at a higher risk. Talk to your local or state environmental monitoring agency for more information about potential risks in your area.  , Throat cancer is caused by a wide variety of factors in our environment. As a result, if you are seriously interested in lessening your risk of throat cancer, you need to understand potential causes and go out of your way to avoid them. Consider that throat cancer can be caused by:The use of tobacco products — this includes chewing and inhalation Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol Poor nutrition Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease Human papillomavirus (HPV) Occupational exposure Genetic Factors Radiation Immunodeficiency Chewing betel nut  , Throat cancer has numerous symptoms that can be confused with many other ailments. These symptoms are especially worrisome if combined with other symptoms that can signal throat cancer. As a result, it is important to stay vigilant about your health and to visit a doctor if you have any concerns or any new and unexplained medical problems. Major symptoms of throat cancer include:Coughing Voice changes, like hoarseness Problems swallowing Ear aches or pains Sore throat or sores or lumps in the throat Unexpected weight loss  , Treatment for throat cancer varies and has come a long way over the last several decades. Different treatments come with different associated problems. As a result, you should consult your doctor and ask if you have any questions or concerns about treatment.Radiation therapy Surgery Chemotherapy Drug therapy  ",1132,"['work environment', 'symptoms', 'secondhand tobacco smoke', 'informed sex', 'treatment', 'gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'throat cancer', 'good dental health', 'alcohol', 'acid reflux', 'pay attention', 'local environmental threats', 'tobacco products', 'oral hygiene', 'good nutrition']"

You want to start by running at least 2 miles (3.2 km) and work your way up to at least 10.; , Schedule your long run and your rest days strategically, so that it does not adversely affect your other plans.   If you have signed up for the Tough Mudder with a team, you may want to sync several of your workouts with the teammates. Working out in tandem will help you push yourself harder. Most Tough Mudder teams are comprised of 5 to 10 people.  , In fact, the larger the number of trail runs you do per week, the better off you will be on race day. Trail running combines hills for better cardio training and soft earth for better balance.  , Incorporate hill intervals or stair intervals as the weeks go on. When you run, sprint for 1/4 of a mile and jog to catch your breath.   Don’t walk between intervals. You will not have the opportunity to walk during a Tough Mudder. You will go from running to obstacles and repeat for 10 miles (16 km).  , On the 4 days you also do strength training, do lower amounts of cardio. Here is an example running program for a 12-week lead up:   Week 1: Do a 1.5-mile treadmill run 2 days and a 2-mile trail run 2 other days. Do a 3-mile trail run. (Include 30 to 40 minutes of bodyweight/strength training 3 times per week after short treadmill or trail runs). Week 2: Do a 2-mile treadmill run 2 days and a 2-mile trail run 2 days. Do a 3.5-mile trail run. (Include 30 to 40 minutes of bodyweight/strength training 3 times per week after short treadmill or trail runs). Week 3: Do a 2-mile treadmill run 2 days and a 3-mile trail run 2 days. Do a 4-mile trail run another day. (Include 30 to 40 minutes of bodyweight/strength training 3 times per week after short treadmill or trail runs). Week 4: Do a 2-mile treadmill run 2 days and a 2-mile run/jog interval 2 days. Do a 5-mile run another day. (Include 30 to 40 minutes of bodyweight/strength training 3 times per week after short treadmill or trail runs). Week 5: Do a 2-mile treadmill run 1 day and a 3-mile run/jog interval 2 days. Do a 5.5-mile all-terrain run on another day. Replace 1 day of strength training/running with plyometrics. Week 6: Do a 1-hour run/jog day, a 50-minute hill interval day and a 6-mile run day. Replace a treadmill run and strength training workout with 1 plyometrics routine and a Tabata interval day (See below for explanation). Week 7: Do a 1-hour run/jog day, a 50-minute hill interval session day, a plyometrics routine day, a Tabata interval day and a 6.5-mile all terrain run. Week 8: Do 65 minutes of run/jog intervals 1 day, 50 minutes of hill intervals another day, a plyometrics day, a Tabata day and a 7-mile all-terrain run. Week 9: Do 2 Tabata training days of at least 50 minutes, do 50-minute hill intervals twice per week and run a 7.5-mile all-terrain trail. Week 10: Continue 50-minutes of Tabata training twice per week, do hill intervals twice per week and do an 8-mile trail run. Week 11: Continue the same as last week, pushing to 8.5 or 9 miles (13.7 or 14.5 km) during your long run, if you choose. Week 12: Do a single 5-mile all-terrain run, a 30-minute treadmill run and a 40-minute Tabata session in the week you prepare for your race. , Bodyweight exercise means that you will use your own body’s weight for resistance. You will do these exercises 3 times per week, every other day.   Start with 30 minutes of pushups, pull-ups, burpees, lunges, and squats. Do 20 repetitions of each of these exercises with short rests in between. Do these exercises on the same day as your shorter runs. The run will serve to warm up your muscles. Do upper body weightlifting, like bicep curls, flys, presses and tricep curls after you complete the bodyweight exercises.  , By week 3, you should be using 7 to 30 lb. (3.1 to 13.6kg) weights to increase your resistance during weightlifting and bodyweight exercises.   Be conservative when you use weights. It’s better to start with a smaller weight and increase it later than to injure yourself with heavy weights. You can also use a weighted vest during cardio or outside training to increase resistance. Tailor your plan to address your weakest muscles. , Plyometrics are explosive interval exercises that combine jumping, speed and strength training. The following exercises should be performed with 3 sets of 12 reps and a short jogging rest in between.   Do box jumps. Start on the ground and jump onto a high bench, platform or wooden box. Do squat jumps. When you get to the lowest point of a squat, jump high in the air. Land upright and squat again immediately. Do power skipping. Cover rough terrain quickly by skipping for 1 minute, just as you did when you were a kid. Do lateral jumps. Set up cones. Jump to the right side and jump back. Repeat. Do pushups. Lower yourself down to the ground, then press your arms against the ground in an explosive motion. You should lift yourself off the ground each time. Do plyometric exercises for 30 to 40 minutes at a time. These exercises are harder on your joints, so take rest days and don’t push yourself to injury. , Do this exercise for 60-minutes with at least a day’s rest between plyometrics and Tabata intervals. You will choose at least 6 exercises to repeat in 4-minute sets. Do the exercise at full intensity for 20 seconds, and then rest for 10 seconds. Repeat this interval 8 times, until you reach 4-minutes. Rest for 1 minute with a walk or jog, and then do another Tabata protocol with a different exercise. Good exercises include sprints, mountain climbers, skater jumps, cycling, pushups, lunges and boxing.  , Better yet, find a ropes course or outdoor exercise equipment at your local park. A gym environment is too comfortable to imitate a Tough Mudder race. , If you only have cotton workout gear, you should get used to wearing tight-fitting workout shorts, shirts or suits. Cotton carries extra weight and will make you chafe. Wear gloves with the tips of the fingers cut off during hard training and race day. It will help you grip while you are in mud and water.  , The shock will mimic the cold-water obstacles you will experience.  , Go trail running while it’s raining, if you get a chance. It may be your only chance to get used to running in mud.  , As you sprint or finish your set, cheer each other on.  , Although there will be some mysteries, you can adjust your routine to train for whatever the course has to offer.

Testosterone is commonly prescribed to treat hypogonadism in men - a condition that develops when the testes don't function correctly.However, this is far from the only reason why someone might want testosterone. Below are just a few other reasons:   Testosterone is sometimes given to transgender people as part of their gender affirmation and transition. Some women receive testosterone as a treatment for androgen deficiency, which can occur after menopause. The most common symptom of androgen deficiency in women is decreased libido.Finally, some men seek testosterone treatment to counteract the normal effects of decreased testosterone production that results with aging. However, this practice is still not well-studied, so many physicians advise against it. Some of the studies that have been done have given mixed results.; , Injection is a commonly-used means of administering testosterone to a patient. However, there are actually a wide range of alternative methods for getting testosterone in to the body, some of which may be preferable to certain patients. These include:Topical gel or cream Skin patch (similar to a nicotine patch)       Oral tablets Mucoadhesive applied to the teeth Testosterone stick (applied under the arm like deodorant) Subcutaneous implant  , Because testosterone is a hormone that can cause significant changes in your body's function, it is known to exacerbate or worsen certain medical conditions. Testosterone should not be administered if a patient suffers from prostate cancer or breast cancer. All patients considering testosterone treatment should receive a prostate exam and a screening for prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) before and after therapy to make sure prostate cancer is not present., Testosterone is a fairly powerful hormone. Even with safe, doctor-monitored use, it can have noticeable side effects. The most common side effects from testosterone treatment are:Acne and/or oily skin Fluid retention Stimulation of prostate tissue, which can result in decreased urine flow and frequency Development of breast tissue       Worsening of sleep apnea Shrinking of the testes Decreased sperm count/infertility Increase in red blood cell count       Changes in cholesterol levels  , Like any serious medical treatment, the decision to receive testosterone treatment shouldn't be made lightly. Seek the advice of your doctor before proceeding - s/he will be able to help you assess your condition and goals to determine whether testosterone is right for you.  , Testosterone for injection is usually in the form of testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthate. These liquids come in multiple concentrations, so before giving an injection, it’s very important to make sure that your intended dosage takes into account the concentration of the testosterone serum. Usually, testosterone comes in a concentration of either 100 mg/ml or 200 mg/ml. In other words, some doses of testosterone are twice as concentrated as others. Double check your testosterone before you give an injection to make sure you have the right dosage for the concentration you've chosen.  , As with all injections, it’s tremendously important to use a sterile, never-before-used needle when administering testosterone. Dirty needles can spread deadly blood-borne diseases like hepatitis and HIV. Use a clean, sealed, capped needle every time you give a testosterone injection.   Another thing to consider is the fact that testosterone is fairly viscous and oily compared to other injectable medications. Because of this, you’ll want to initially use a slightly thicker-bore needle than normal (for instance, a 18 or 20-gauge) to draw up your dose. Thick needles can be especially painful, so, usually, you’ll remove the thicker needle and replace it with a thinner one when it comes time to give the actual injection. 3-ml (cc) syringes will be large enough for most testosterone doses. If you drop the syringe or needle, throw it away. Do not use it because it is no longer sterile.  , To reduce the risk of infection, it’s important to keep your hands clean when giving an injection. Wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap and water, then put on clean gloves. If you accidentally touch any unsanitized objects or surfaces before giving the injection, replace your gloves as a safety measure.  , Your doctor will have given you a recommended dose - determine the volume of your dose in relation to the concentration of your testosterone. For instance, if your doctor recommends a dose of 100 mg, you’ll want 1 ml of a 100 mg/ml testosterone solution or ½ ml of a 200 mg/ml solution. To draw up your dose, first draw air into your syringe equal to the volume of your dosage. Then, wipe the top of the medication bottle with an alcohol wipe, insert your needle through the lid and into the medication, and push the air from your syringe into the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down and draw out the exact dosage of testosterone.   Injecting air into the bottle raises its internal air pressure, making it easier to draw the medication into the syringe. This is especially important with testosterone, which can be difficult to draw because it’s so thick.  , Thick needles can be fairly painful. There’s no need to subject yourself to this extra pain, especially if you’re on a program that calls for frequent injections. To switch to a smaller needle once you’ve drawn up your dose, remove the needle from the bottle and hold it point-up in front of you. Draw a small amount of air - this is to put space between the medicine and the top of the syringe so that you don’t spill. Using the (washed and gloved) hand that’s not holding the syringe, carefully re-cap and unscrew the needle, then replace it with a thinner one (like a 23-gauge).   Note that the second needle must also be sealed and sterile.  , Injecting air bubbles into a person’s body can cause a serious medical condition called an embolism. Because of this, it’s very important to ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe when you inject the testosterone. Do this via a process called aspiration. See below for instructions:   Hold the syringe with its needle uncapped and pointing up in front of you. Look for air bubbles in the syringe. Flick the side of the syringe to get these bubbles to rise to the top. When your dosage is bubble-free, slowly depress the plunger to force the air at the top of the syringe out. Stop when you see a tiny drop of medication come out of the tip of the syringe. Be careful not to squirt or spray a significant portion of your dosage onto the floor.  , Testosterone injections are typically intramuscular - that is, given directly into a muscle. Two relatively easy and accessible sites for intramuscular injection are the vastus lateralis (top outside region of the thigh) or the glut (upper back portion of the thigh, ie, the butt cheek). These aren’t the only places that testosterone can be injected, but they are by far the most common. Whichever of these sites you choose, take a sterile alcohol pad and wipe the immediate area around where you intend to inject. This will kill bacteria on the skin, preventing infection.   If injecting into the glute, choose an injection site in the top outside section of the glute. In other words, pick a site either in the top left corner of the left glute or the top right corner of the right glute. These site have the best access to muscle tissue and allow you to avoid hitting nerves and blood vessels in other parts of the glute.  , Hold your loaded syringe like a dart at a 90 degree angle above the sterile injection site. Quickly plunge it into the flesh using one quick, steady motion. Before depressing the plunger, draw back on it slightly. If you draw blood into the syringe, remove the needle and choose a different spot, as this means you’ve hit a vein. Inject the medication at a steady, controlled pace.   You may experience moderate discomfort, pressure, stinging, pressure, or slight burning. This is normal. If it becomes severe or if you feel shooting pain, stop immediately, and contact a doctor.  , Once you have fully depressed the plunger, slowly pull the needle out. Assess the needle entry point for bleeding, and apply a sterile band-aid and/or a clean cotton ball if needed. Dispose of the used needle and syringe in a proper sharps container.   If you do not have a sharps container, find a sturdy, puncture-proof container, such as a laundry detergent bottle. Make sure that it has a tight-fitting lid. Take the container to your doctor's office or a pharmacy to be safely disposed of.If, after injection, you experience redness, swelling, or discomfort beyond that of normal soreness at the site of injection, contact a physician immediately.

"['understand that there are three important factors that contribute to skill in an fps: accuracy', 'movement and strategy.', 'develop accuracy', 'use movement to engage and evade enemies', 'combine aiming and moving', 'ducking ( for snipers ): unlike bunny hopping', 'ducking is harder to learn', 'moving side to side: move side to side while remaining accurate', 'follow smart strategy', 'useful weapon statistics']",How to Be a Pro on Rush Team,", Aiming is the foremost important factor in judging skill. This is a factor that can hardly be taught. Aiming accurately must be learned through self practice. For snipers, you have to get the ""feel for it"" and base clicks on intuition, especially for quick scoping. For rifles, aiming for head shots during close range combat is highly essential since that is the quickest way to kill your opponent. Make it a habit to aim for the head every time you use your rifle., The second most important factor in judging skill is movement. Unlike aiming, this can be taught.  In Rush Team, you have 10 stamina bars. Running uses up approximately 1.3 bars/second while jumping depletes 2.5 stamina bars/jump. When you run out of stamina, you will have to wait for the stamina points to recover. Stamina recovers at a rate of 2 bars/second.  , There are two techniques that pros use: bunny hopping and ducking.  Bunny hopping: Bunny hopping requires the user to jump back and forth while aiming in between, usually to the side while facing forwards. Not only does doing so annoy some of your opponents, it will ultimately ensure your survival while allowing you to kill as many enemies as you can. Never shoot while you are jumping. It is highly inaccurate. Instead, jump the aim, then shoot (and repeat).  , The process is the same, except that you are adding in a crouch right after each jump. The benefit to this is that it decreases your chances of getting hit. The downside is that it is harder to control, makes aiming harder, and slows down overall movement. Jump, then aim, crouch and shoot (repeat)., Moving side to side makes it more difficult for enemies to hit you., ""Play smart"" is the third aspect in determining skill. This is a very broad range that contains a tedious amount of discussion. To simplify things, these are key points to know:  When low on health, retreat and get to a health box. Depending on the map, it may not be safe for you to sit and wait to recover hp. In those cases, you can rely on your teammates to cover your back. Keep track of their positions. If they are near you, pay attention to their movements. If they are killed, you can determine whether or not an enemy is nearby. From this little piece of information, you can decide on what move you will make next. There is no shame in using your teammates as decoys while you kill steal them from behind. Getting headshots in FFA matches will grant you an hp bar. Hp bars stack up so it is very important for you to get at least one headshot while having full hp. This will allow you to survive one hit from the m40 sniper. When using the M40 or AWF sniper during an all weapons match, be aware that you do not have to wait for your (M40)sniper to reload completely before you can use; you can reload one bullet and then switch your weapons back and forth so that the sniper can be used immediately. However, it is recommended that you have at least 3 bullets ready at any given time with the M40. These 2 snipers AWF and the M40 are considerably lighter compared to the other counterparts, which means they also impact less on your movement while handling them at the given point. When facing multiple enemies, kill the ones that are more of a threat first. Memorize how many hits it takes to kill with each weapon. Chose the weapon which you think suits best for you.  , There are wide range of weapons to chose from this game and can impact the way you play your game. This section will break down the categories of weapons to chose from and the advantage and disadvantages of them.   Melee Weapons- Fire Axe and Fire Axe Vip are the dual handed weapons which swing fast and can 1 hit kill your enemy only provided the fact that you don't end up hitting them in their leg. Katana is similar to the Axe but it has a longer range but suffers from slow swings compared to them; this weapon is also 1 hit kill in most of the circumstances. Fists and Butterfly have a quite fast swings where Butterfly being a knife which stabs twice as fast compared to Katana and Fists punching at same speed; but the draw back being their damage output where Butterfly will require 2 hits to down an enemy and same for fists ( but they will down your enemy in 1 hit if you will hit them in their head). Wood Bat and Metal Bat also have really fast swings but they only do about 80% damage so it will require another hit to kill your enemy.  Grenade Types- Normal grenade, Grenade Gold, and Grenade Forest - have a normal fuse and do full damage only if it placed near the blast radius of the enemy.Grenade Blue - being the smaller version of the normal one but you can carry 2, they have shorter fuse, they also they do less damage in their blast radius.Grenade Red has a longer fuse compared to the others and does full damage.  Pistols- Berretta- a pistol which holds 15 rounds in it's magazine and has fairly good RPM and it does about 2 bars of damage. Colt - which holds 10 in it magazine and has slower RPM compared to the Berretta but does more damage on about 2.5-3 bars. Desert Eagle and Eagle Silver - Pistols which holds 7 rounds and does significantly more damage compared at stealing about 5 bars which means 2 hits will down your opponent but this gun has slow RPM. Eagle Silver - Pistol which is very similar compared to the other Eagles but has slightly better RPM. Snub - Pistol which is similar to Eagle but takes away 6 bars of health and holds 5 on it's magazine and also suffers from longer reload. M1911 a pistol which holds 11 in it's magazine and has the highest RPM compared to the other pistols and does about 2 bars of damage.

"['choose your colors', 'choose your theme', 'know how much candy to buy', 'and be sure to get a variety', 'consider including some sweet', 'non-candy items', 'get three different sizes of containers and trays', ""don't forget the serving utensils"", 'get the right sized table', ""cover the table with a tablecloth that matches your party's color scheme"", 'divide your table into three zones', 'arrange your containers in the different zones', 'fill up your small', 'medium', 'and large containers', 'consider taking things further with a few decorative touches', 'tie it all in with a centerpiece', 'add some favor boxes or bags so that your guests can take their candy home', 'create some signs and labels for your candy', 'hang a backdrop or banner on the wall behind your table', 'add color to the table']",How to Make a Candy Buffet," If the party or event that you are making the candy buffet for already has a color scheme, you should use the same colors. If the party or event does not have a set color scheme, you should come up with one; choose 3 to 4 different colors.Use the color scheme when buying your candy. Many party stores and online stores sell candy in specific colors, such as white and turquoise.; , If your party has a theme, you would want to replicate some of that theme for your candy buffet. While you may not always find candy that matches that theme, you will certainly be able to find plates, trays, banners, tablecloths, and other decorative items that do., The more different types of candy you get, the more interesting and appealing your candy buffet will be. Consider candies such as: hard candies, lollipops, chocolates, rock candy, and mints.You will need about ½ pound (225 grams) of candy per guest. The more guests you have, the more different types of candy you should get. Here are some numbers to get you started:For large events and weddings (100+ guests), plan on getting 8 to 10 different types of candy. For small events (fewer than 100 guests), plan on getting 5 to 8 different types of candy.  , Your candy buffet doesn't have to contain just candy. Don't get carried away, however; include one or two non-candy items; you are making a candy buffet after all! Here are some ideas to get you started:Cookies, cupcakes, and macaroons Marshmallows Nuts Popcorn Pretzels  , You should have large, medium, and small containers. This will not only make it easier to hold different types of candy, but it will also help create depth and make your buffet look larger and more interesting. Clear, acrylic or glass jars and vases are the best for letting the bright colors of the candy shine through, but you can also use other items too. Here are some ideas to get you started:Clear, glass or acrylic apothecary jars and vases Trays and platters Cake stands and cupcake stands Baskets, bowls, buckets, and pails  , Some types of candy, such as lollipops, can be grabbed by hand, but other types should be served with a scoop or tongs. Not only do these make the buffet look more elegant and interesting, but they also make it more hygienic. Here are some ideas to get you started:Clear or metal candy scoops Colorful spoons Small, clear or metal tongs  , The larger your party will be, the more candy you will need. This does not necessarily mean that you should get a huge table, however. You want the table to be big enough to fit all of your containers, but not so big that the table looks sparse. Your guests should be able to reach around the different jars and vessels without knocking anything over.  In terms of candy buffet tables, smaller is better., It would be best to stick with a solid-colored tablecloth, as a patterned one will make the table look too busy and take attention away from the candy. It does not have to be anything fancy either—a cheap, plastic tablecloth will work well!, Your table should have three zones: front, middle, and back. The front zone is the area at the front of your table, and will contain the items that get handled the most. The back zone is in the back of your table, and will contain the items that will get handled the least. The middle zone is the space in between and will contain everything else., Go through your container first, and sort them by shape and size. Then, place them in the different zones. Try to place the taller containers towards the center of the table, and the shorter ones towards the side edges. Here is what containers work best in the three zones:The front zone should contain your trays, short/low containers, and decorative boxes. The middle zone should contain your apothecary jars, vases, small baskets and buckets, and candy dishes. The back zone should contain your largest, tallest containers, including cupcake stands. You can also use crates to elevate shorter containers.  , Now that you have your containers in their zones, it is time to fill them. Here are some ideas on how you can fill up your different containers based on the zones that they are in:Fill the small zone containers with large, bulky items, such as: cookies, cupcakes, and larger candy bars. Fill the middle zone containers with scoop-able candy, such as gumballs, gummy worms, candy canes, and chocolate-covered raisins. Be sure to include tongs or scoops with these.Fill the back-zone containers that are easy to grab, such cupcakes and foil-covered candy. Avoid unwrapped candy, as that requires scooping, which will be tricky as the candy nears the bottom of the container.  , Adding things like banners, labels, and centerpieces is not absolutely necessary, but it can really take your candy buffet to the next level. You do not have to use all of the suggestions in this section—instead, choose a few that appeal the most to you, and use them in inspiration!   Don't overdo it, or your buffet will look cluttered. There should be enough space on your table so that your guests can reach for the candy without knocking anything over., You can use the same centerpiece that the rest of the tables have, or you can use a fancy cupcake stand, and fill it up with cupcakes (decorated to match your party's theme, of course). If your event has a cake, you could even use the cake as the centerpiece! If cupcakes aren't your thing, you could use some floral or candle arrangements instead., Keep in mind, however, that the bigger your favor boxes/bags are, the more candy you will need; people usually like to fill their favor boxes/bags most of the way. Another option would be to include some bulky items on your candy buffet table, such as large lollipops, cookies, or cupcakes; these items will fill up those large boxes/bags.Choose paper, organza, or cellophane bags in colors that match your party's theme.Choose mini take-out boxes, gift boxes, or favor tins in colors that match your party's theme., Write or print out the name for your candy (ie: Chocolate Kisses, Gumballs, Gummy Worms, etc) on pretty labels that match your party's theme. You can also write the labels on mini chalkboards, mini wooden pick signs, clothespins, etc. Choose something that works with your decor.Don't be afraid to get creative with your labels either; you can match them to the theme of your party. For example:  If your party's theme is Harry Potter, you can label red licorice as ""Licorice Wands."" Gold-foil Lindor chocolates could easily become ""Golden Snitches."" If your party's theme is pirates, you could call chocolate coins ""Pirate's Booty"" or ""Pirate's Treasure."" Seashell-shaped chocolates could be called ""Mermaid's Favor."" If you are having a Halloween party, you could call chocolate raisins ""Beetle Eyes"" or ""Troll Boogers,"" and haystack cookies ""Witch Hair.""  , The walls are often a forgotten, but very important, part of a room's decor. If you want to draw the focus to your candy buffet, consider hanging a garland or banner on the wall behind the table. You could also hang up pictures or paper cut-outs instead. Whichever you choose, make sure that the colors and themes match the theme of your party.A great example of a matching banner would be a poster that says ""Honeydukes"" for a Harry Potter themed party. Honeydukes was the name of a popular candy shop in the books. A great example of matching cut-outs would be paper snowflakes for a winter wonderland themed party. You would also hang long tinsel around the edge of the table to mimic icicles!  , Some colorful confetti scattered across the table can add color without taking up much spaces. You can also use small items, such as flower petals, rhinestones, strands of curled ribbon, or sequins. Whatever you end up using, make sure that it matches the theme of your party. For example, flower petals would work great for a wedding, while rhinestones would work well for a pirate themed party (to resemble treasure).  Confetti comes in many different shapes and colors. Choose one that matches your party's theme. For example, blue and white snowflake confetti would work great for a winter wonderland themed party!

Undertaking leadership exercises with your dog will help it understand that you are in control and deserve its trust and respect. Dogs are naturally pack animals; your dog will be quite willing to cede you authority once it recognizes you as its leader.Try one or more of the following exercises:   Sit on the floor with your puppy, then pick him up gently with both hands positioned just behind his front legs. Hold him at arm's length and make eye contact. Gently growl if he attempts to struggle. Continue holding him until he relaxes. Vary the length of time and location in which you perform this exercise.; , Ensure everyone in your household is on the same page. Consistency is key to establishing a successful training regimen.  , Commit yourself to work daily with your dog. You'll need to repeat most commands many times before your dog is fully trained.  , Your mood transfers readily to your dog. If you are tired or agitated, your dog will pick up on these cues. She'll be less likely to obey, and likely become frustrated and tired herself. Wait to hold a training session until you're feeling calm and in a good mood., Yelling tells your dog that you're tense, upset, or otherwise out of control. These cues fail to inspire confidence or trust. Remember, you need to be the alpha figure in your relationship with your dog. Speaking at a normal volume level helps establish your command of the situation., The specific commands you choose are less important than their clarity, although once you've chosen it is important to be consistent.Recognize, however, that using more common commands may help in situations where someone else may need to issue a command for the safety of your dog or those around her. Also make sure your dog understands his or her name. The most common dog commands include:   Watch me Sit Stay Down (as in lie down) Off (as in get off me or the furniture) Stand Come Heel (walk close to my side) Leave it, As you determine which voice commands to use with your dog, recognize that your tone delivers an equally important message.   Use a higher-pitched, more excited tone of voice to deliver praise and issue active commands (""Come!"" ""Good dog!""). Dogs hear these tones as encouraging or enthusiastic. Use a low-pitched, growly tone to issue corrections and commands that don't involve movement (""Off!"" ""Stay!""). Dogs respond to low-pitched or growling noises with caution or acquiescence. You might try a low-pitched, flat or slowly descending tone of voice for a command such as ""Stay!"" that requires some authority, but less correction., Now that you have prepared your household and selected your commands for training, you can begin the work of teaching your dog that ""Come!"" means ""Come!"" Set aside time each day for training, but remember that dogs have limited attention spans. Limit training sessions to 15 minutes or less.   Introduce new voice commands one at a time. Keep expectations realistic. Try working on one component of a behavior. If you want your dog to sit and then stay when you walk away from him, start by training your dog to sit quietly while you remain nearby. Over time you can train him to remain sitting while you walk away. Start with just a few seconds of compliance and then work up over time. For example, you may work with your dog to ""stay"" for five seconds over the course of one week and then work on a ten-second ""stay"" the next. Begin working on a command to ""come"" by encouraging your dog to travel just a few yards; over time, you can develop her ability to respond over greater distances or around a corner. Voice commands are essentially habits, and as with establishing any good habit, repetition is essential. Try doing five to 15 repetitions of one behavior before moving on to the next command., Use positive reinforcement as a training tool to ensure your dog understands when he's responding well to your commands.   Most dogs are highly food-motivated, so food can be an especially attractive reward. Experiment to see what works best for your pet, but keep food rewards small so you can use them repeatedly: a soft piece of food, doggie treat, or small square of cheese. Avoid hard foods that she'll need to break apart; you want to ensure she associates the reward with her behavior, and the process of eating a more complicated food could distract her. Couple food rewards with verbal rewards. Praise your dog each time she responds well to your voice command. Consider non-food treats such as a favorite toy, a scratch on the head, or brief playtime (ideally toward the end of a training session).Over time, reduce the frequency of food rewards. Cut back to three out of four times the dog performs a given behavior, then two out of four, and so on. Be sure to keep selective rewards random, however. Dogs can be quite smart -- you don't want her to figure out she need only comply every other time! Continue to respond with verbal praise each time your dog obeys., Using touch at the same time as you issue a voice command can confuse your dog. Her sense of touch will always been more important than your voice command. Consequently, she'll be less likely to respond to your voice command alone., If you aren't willing to get up and physically make your dog follow your instructions, refrain from issuing a voice command. Otherwise, you'll teach your dog that your command is optional., Ensure your dog is safe in any training environment before you begin, but practice issuing commands in different places and around distractions such as people and other pets. This way your dog will learn that ""come"" or ""stay"" means the same thing in all situations, and not just in the comfort of your backyard or local park., Keep an eye on your puppy, and as she starts to sit, repeat the command ""sit."" If she then turns and makes eye contact, deliver a verbal reward such as ""good girl."" Over time, she'll learn to associate the sound ""sit"" with sitting down, and realize that if you say that word and she sits she'll receive praise.

A skillful manipulator knows what to look for and targets people who are going through a difficult period in their life or a change that may or may not be of their own making. Possible candidates include:   People who have lost their jobs and fear for their future. Recently divorced people, particularly when the divorce was a bitter one.Those suffering from lingering illness, especially one they don’t understand. People who have lost a loved one, particularly if they were very close to that person and had few other friends. Young people away from home for the first time. These are particular favorites of religious cult leaders.One particular predatory tactic is to find out enough information about the person and his or her belief system to explain the tragedy the person has experiencing in a manner consistent with that belief system. This can later be expanded to explain history in general through that belief system, while subtly modifying it to the brainwasher’s interpretation.; , As people who are experiencing a personal tragedy or other major life change are inclined to feel lonely, a skillful brain-washer works to amplify those feelings of loneliness. This isolation can take several forms.   For young people in a cult, it may be preventing them from contacting their friends and family members. For a significant other in an abusive relationship, it may mean never letting the victim out of the abuser’s sight or permitting contact with family and friends. For prisoners in an enemy prison camp, it may involve isolating prisoners from one another while subjecting them to subtle or overt forms of torture.  , Brainwashing only works when the brainwasher is in a superior position to the victim. This means that the victim has to be broken down, so the brainwasher can rebuild the victim in his or her image. This can be done through mental, emotional, or ultimately physical means for long enough to physical and emotionally wear down the target.   Mental tortures may begin with lying to the victim and then progress to embarrassing or intimidating the victim. This form of torture can be done with words or gestures ranging from an expression of disapproval to invading the victim’s personal space. Emotional tortures are not kind, of course, but may begin with verbal insults, then progress to badgering, spitting, or more dehumanizing things such as stripping the victim to be photographed or just looked at. Physical tortures may include starvation, freezing, sleep deprivation, beatings, mutilations, and others, none are acceptable in society.. Physical torture is commonly used by abusive parents and spouses, as well as in prison and “re-education” camps.  , Along with wearing down the victim’s resistance, it’s important to provide a seemingly more attractive alternative to what the victim has known before contact with the brainwasher. This can be done through a variety of methods:   Allowing contact only with others who have already been brainwashed. This creates a form of peer pressure that encourages the new victim to want to be like and be accepted by the new group. This may be reinforced through touch, rap sessions, or group sex, or by stricter means such as a uniform dress code, controlled diet, or other rigid rules. Repetition of the message through means ranging from singing or chanting the same phrases over and over, often emphasizing certain key words or phrases. Mimicking the rhythm of the human heartbeat through the thought leader’s speech cadence or musical accompaniment. This can be enhanced with lighting that’s not too dim or too harsh and a room temperature to encourage relaxation. Never letting the victim have time to think. This can mean simply never letting the victim have time alone, or it can mean bombarding the victim with repeated lectures on topics beyond comprehension, while discouraging questions. Presenting an “us vs. them” mentality where the thought leader is right and the outside world is wrong. The goal is to achieve blind obedience, to where the victim will commit his or her money and life to the brainwasher and his or her stated goals., This can take anywhere from a few weeks to several years, depending on the circumstances of the brainwashing.   An extreme form of this complacency is known as the Stockholm syndrome, where two bank robbers in Sweden in 1973 held four hostages for a period of 131 hours. After the hostages were rescued, they found themselves identifying with their captors, to the point that one of the women became engaged to her captor and another set up a legal defense fund for the criminals.Patty Hearst, kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army in 1974, is also considered a victim of Stockholm syndrome., Much of the retraining is done through some of the same operant conditioning techniques of reward and punishment that were used to break the victim down in the first place. Positive experiences are now used to reward the victim for thinking as the brainwasher desires, while negative experiences are used to punish the last vestiges of disobedience.   One form of reward is giving the victim a new name. This is commonly associated with cults, but the SLA also did this with Patty Hearst when they gave her the name “Tania.” , Although brainwashing can be effective and thorough, most brainwashers find it necessary to test the depths of their control over their subjects. Control can be tested in several ways, depending on the brainwasher’s goals, with the results determining how much reinforcement the victim needs to remain brainwashed.   Extorting money is one way to test control, as well as enrich the brainwasher’s pockets. Psychic medium Rose Marks used her control over author Jude Deveraux to bilk Deveraux out of $17 million in cash and property while ruining the writer’s career. .Committing criminal acts, either with or for the brainwasher, is another. Patty Hearst accompanying the SLA on one of their robberies is an example of this. , Brainwashing victims can appear focused on the group and or its leader to the point of obsession. At the same time, they seem to be unable to solve problems without the help of the group or its leader.  , They may also withdraw from people who don’t share their interest in the brainwasher.  , Brainwashing victims tend to be listless, withdrawn, and devoid of whatever personality marked them before they were brainwashed.This is particularly noticeable in both cult victims and spouses in an abusive relationship.   Some victims may internalize their anger, leading to depression and a host of physical disorders, possibly even to suicide. Others may vent their anger on anyone they see as the cause of their problems, often through verbal or physical confrontation.  , This realization is often accompanied by denial and anguish, as the subject begins to question things without having had practice in questioning things. Gradually, the subject should become aware of how he or she was manipulated.  , Exposure to multiple options, without overwhelming the subject with too many options at once, will provide the subject with a new, broader perspective from which to challenge the beliefs implanted by the brainwasher.   Some of these contrasting ideas may, in themselves, come with their own forms of manipulation. In such cases, it’s helpful to also seek out as unbiased forms of those ideas as possible.A stronger form of this exposure is to force the subject to relive the brainwashing experience by having him or her act it out, but providing the subject with options to counteract the brainwashing. This type of therapy requires a therapist skilled in psychodrama techniques.  , At first, the subject may become anxious about making decisions for himself or herself or feel ashamed about making the “wrong” decision now or in the past. With practice, however, this anxiety will fade.

Be aware that a reduced appetite can be hard to notice at first—your rabbit may be sick for several days before you realize he’s eating less.Anorexia in rabbits can lead to serious medical problems, so do not delay in getting treatment for your rabbit if you notice he is not eating.   Your rabbit may be eating less because he is unable to eat, not because he doesn’t want to. For example, dental disease may make it difficult for your rabbit to chew his food properly.; , A healthy rabbit produces two types of fecal pellets: a hard pellet made of indigestible fiber, and a soft pellet (‘cecotrope’). Rabbits eat the cecotropes for additional nutrients. For some digestive problems, such as gastrointestinal (GI) stasis, rabbits will produce fewer pellets, or none at all.Digestive problems due to a bacteria or virus can cause diarrhea. Inflammation of the intestine can produce mucus-covered pellets.Consider taking a picture of the feces so you can show your veterinarian what the feces look like.  , As with a decreased appetite, your rabbit’s demeanor and behavior may change when he has digestive upset. For example, he may become more lethargic and prefer to be left alone. Your rabbit may also lie awkwardly on his side or remain in a sitting position to decrease pressure on his belly.Your rabbit may develop a hunched posture and start grinding his teeth because of the abdominal pain.Your rabbit may even press his stomach against the floor because of the pain. This occurs if your rabbit has gas., If your rabbit will let you, gently touch his belly. His belly may feel like dough, which indicates gas buildup.Gas accumulation may also make the belly feel very hard.With some digestive problems, such as GI stasis, harmful bacteria can outnumber good bacteria in the gut. These harmful bacteria can release gas., The digestive system will make sounds (‘gut sounds’) as it is processing food and moving it along through the system. These sounds will be abnormal or completely absent if your rabbit has a digestive problem. For example, if your rabbit has gas, his belly will make gurgling noises.With GI stasis, gut sounds are abnormally frequent early on, then decrease or stop completely as the condition worsens., Digestive problems in rabbits can be life threatening. As soon as you suspect a digestive problem in your rabbit, take him to your veterinarian immediately. Your veterinarian will first perform a physical exam of your rabbit. They will then conduct diagnostic tests, depending on what they suspect is causing the digestive problem.   If your rabbit has diarrhea, your veterinarian will test the feces to identify the specific organism (e.g., Clostridium).Your veterinarian will take x-rays and/or perform an abdominal ultrasound if they suspect GI stasis or GI obstruction. A GI obstruction can be a life-threatening situation requiring emergency treatment.Being able to visualize your rabbit’s belly will help your veterinarian diagnose and treat your rabbit effectively.  , Treating digestive problems in rabbits typically involves several general treatment strategies, including rehydration, restoring gut movement, and pain control.These treatments are best performed by a veterinarian, at least until the rabbit is well enough for at-home care.   Treatment options will vary slightly, depending on the specific digestive problem.  , Dehydration can cause digestive problems in rabbits, and be a symptom of these problems.To rehydrate your rabbit, your veterinarian will give him fluids.How your veterinarian administers the fluids (e.g., by mouth, under the skin, directly into a vein) will depend on several factors, such as your rabbit’s ability to drink on his own and the severity of the dehydration.   Rehydrating your rabbit will put more fluid in his digestive system, which will soften digestive contents and allow them to pass through the system more easily., If your rabbit’s digestive system isn’t moving food through very quickly, or at all, it will need some help getting back to normal. In addition to fluid therapy, your veterinarian may administer medications called prokinetics to encourage the gut to get moving again.Prokinetics are helpful in treating GI stasis, as well as diarrhea caused by overuse of antibiotics.If your rabbit has an obstruction, he should not receive a prokinetic.Prokinetics may take several weeks to restore your rabbit’s normal gut motility., Gas buildup (due to GI obstruction or GI stasis) and diarrhea can be very painful for your rabbit.If the pain is severe, your veterinarian will administer pain medication to get the pain under control as quickly as possible. When your rabbit is well enough to go home, your veterinarian may prescribe a pain medication for at-home care.  , A bad diet (low in indigestible fiber, high in sugar and carbohydrates) is a common cause of digestive problems in rabbits.Your veterinarian will first see if your rabbit can eat a healthy diet on his own. If he cannot, or will not, your veterinarian may try feeding him a high-fiber gruel, such as Oxbow Critical Care, through a syringe., Depending on the nature of the digestive problem, your rabbit may need more specific veterinary care. If your rabbit has gas, his temperature may fall below normal (100 degrees Fahrenheit/38 degrees Celsius), which could cause hypothermia. Your veterinarian will have several options to keep your rabbit warm, including placing him on a heating pad, surrounding him with warm water bottles or soda bottles, or simply holding him., Your veterinarian will administer a product that contains simethicone, an ingredient that relieves gas. Over-the-counter simethicone-containing products are available, but it would be best for your veterinarian to treat your rabbit.Tummy massages are also helping in relieving gas., If your rabbit has a hairball, your veterinarian will try different remedies to break it down. One remedy is fresh pineapple juice, which contains a digestive enzyme. Another remedy is papaya, which contains an enzyme that would break down the mucus holding the hairball together.Keep in mind that the obstructive hairball could cause gas to buildup. In this case, your veterinarian would treat both the gas and the hairball.  , Hairballs and overuse of antibiotics can disrupt the normal balance of good versus bad bacteria in your rabbit’s gut. If your veterinarian identifies more harmful bacteria than good bacteria, they will likely administer a probiotic to increase the level of good bacteria., Following in-hospital veterinary treatment, your rabbit will need at-home care to fully recover. Feeding him a healthy diet will help him recover. Examples of healthy foods are fresh timothy hay and leafy greens (e.g., kale, spinach). A healthy diet also includes plenty of fresh water.Do not give your rabbit dairy products or any treats that are high in sugar, honey, or seeds., A tummy massage is a soothing and effective treatment strategy. If your rabbit has a hairball, a massage can help loosen the hairball so it can pass through his system.A tummy massage can also stimulate gut movements., Physical activity can help improve your rabbit’s gut movements.If your rabbit is well enough to move around, encourage him walk around in his cage. For example, you could move his food a few feet away from him to so he can walk to his food. You could also move his toys a little further away from his sleeping area.

To improve your practice, ask directors for pointers; they are there to help you out. While no show is perfect, with persistence, you can create a very satisfying end result.; , When you are in bed, picture yourself on the stage having a great time. Go through your lines, songs, and dance moves, and picture them going perfectly. Having anxiety about the performance will keep you awake, so the key is to stay relaxed and create a positive image of yourself on the stage.  , Eat plenty of eggs, bananas, spinach, and orange juice. It's also important not to drink alcohol before a performance so that you can focus on what you need to do.  , If your director has a certain dress code in mind, follow it. Because of the constant costume changes, wearing a black tank top and black shorts is efficient. Before wearing it onstage, practice at home. Pick out something in your closet similar to your costume, such as a dress. Practice slipping it on and off, and make sure that nothing snags or pulls. Make sure that whatever you wear backstage is appropriate for pictures, too. Most performers take pictures in their costumes, but sometimes you are required to change before coming out to meet the audience. You must be comfortable in quick change clothes, but still look presentable.  , Some directors and shows call for little makeup if you have small theatre, but it's likely you'll need stage makeup done, which is rather excessive. Your director will most likely tell you what your makeup is supposed to be, you may even have a makeup artist. If they don't tell you, ask. It is never okay to go onstage without any makeup because your face will melt into the lights.  , Be sure to hairspray and tease, if you need the extra volume.  ,   If allowed, keep a water bottle backstage. Don't drink a lot because this can affect your dancing, but just a few sips so that you can sing and speak easily.       Never bring anything backstage that you're not allowed to have. You should never disobey the director.        , Each theatre group is different in the way they set up backstage.  If there are changing rooms in the back, take advantage of them. If not, remember that the entire cast are your friends and that it shouldn't be awkward changing in front of them. If you have a complicated costume -- for example, a dress with hard-to-reach buttons on the back or a zipper that always seems to disappear -- ask a friend to help you out.       When backstage, remember to be quiet. When the audience hears noise backstage, it ruins all of the hard work you put in to create an exceptional show, and is embarrassingly unprofessional.        , Right before you go on stage, gather up all of the cast members and form a circle. Face outward, join hands and picture yourself on the stage. One person should start by squeezing the hand of the person next to them, and the next person will pass it on, and it will keep on going until you've gone around the circle. After this has been done, let go of hands and get ready for the first scene.  , It will be dark where the audience is seated, and you won't be able to see their faces. When you aren't saying lines, take deep breaths. Just make sure the audience can't tell. Just have fun!  , You can make up a funny rhyme to help you remember. Another good idea is to have a friend who can cue you before the next scene, or if the lights die for scenery change, they can nudge you in the right direction.  , Be proud of your performance and display the emotion that your character is feeling. If you are performing an emotional scene, pull the audience into your tale so that it's an enjoyable experience. Keep in mind that you're not only representing who you are as performer, but also the rest of your cast and crew members and your directors as well! Remember to smile (if you are suppose to) and have lots of fun!  , Boring love scenes can be extremely disappointing for the audience. Don't be afraid to hold hands, put your arm around your partner, or even kiss. This is just a performance, it doesn't mean anything. If you feel awkward about something, talk to your partner about it. They'll understand and might even feel the same way. Talk about exactly what you want to do onstage, and what you don't want to do. That way, while it will be more comfortable and routine for you, the audience will love it!  , The curtain call is when the audience will be taking lots of pictures, so wear a big smile. Depending on the type of show, you might want to stay in character for a few extra seconds before you break out into a smile. Also, if you have one last song to sing at the end, belt it out loud and proud. This is when all of your hard work pays off.  , Be gracious, and thank them for taking the time to come and support you. If someone gives you flowers, smile, and be prepared for pictures. It's also polite to introduce your supporters to the other cast members. Never take anyone in the audience backstage or into the changing rooms unless they are allowed to. It's strange and unprofessional to reveal the way the special effects are done and where you keep the props.  , There is always room for improvement, and sometimes performing in front of an audience can help you see what you need to work on.  , They deserve credit for all of the hard work they did to help make the show a success. Remember that although they did mostly behind-the-scenes work, that this is in some ways the most important part and that the show wouldn't be possible without them. It might even be a good idea to bring them flowers!

You will need attention to details and the ability to handle delicate or dangerous materials. You’ll be an important part of a medical team.Write a list of your skills and attributes – things you consider to be your strengths. Consider whether this career will be a good fit for you.; , Make a list of what you want out of your career – salary, working hours, career advancement, etc. Take some time to think about whether you want to pursue a career as a medical technologist.   Medical technologists must be able to work independently, sometimes at night or on weekends. You may sometimes be under considerable pressure, especially when a patient's life depends on fast and accurate test results.  , Contact the hiring department or human resources department at your local hospital or medical laboratory. Ask about what they look for when hiring. You can also ask to speak with a professional in the field when they have time, and ask about their career path and education.   Say something like, “I’m interested in becoming a medical technologist. Could you please suggest any good programs in the area? What degree did you pursue?”  , If you know anyone in the field, talk to them about what program they went to, whether they liked it, and what was required for admissions. You can also work with your high school guidance counselor to find a program that’s right for you. Locate several possible program options and learn what they require for admission by visiting their website or speaking with their admissions department.  , Prepare in high school by taking science classes such as biology and chemistry. Take computer classes, because much of the work in a medical laboratory is done by automated equipment that is controlled by computer programs. Math skills, especially statistics, are also important, so take as much math as you can., Find a program in medical laboratory technology that is accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences. Visit their website at www.naacls.org and select the option for Students, then click Find a Program. Search by state, country, or type of program you want to attend. Select Medical Laboratory Technician in the drop-down menu for Program Type, and search by your location.Locate a program that interests you so you can familiarize yourself with their admissions requirements. Start preparing in high school, if you can.  , Often a 4-year degree is necessary to become a medical technologist, but a 2-year Associate’s degree can be a good jumping off point.Attend an accredited program and complete all the program requirements.   Many 4-year programs will accept transfer credits from your Associate’s degree. Speak with the admissions office at the 4-year college you wish to attend in order to find out.  , Getting a 4-year Bachelor’s degree can lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries in the future, and some workplaces may require it.Major in medical technology or clinical laboratory science. You will take classes in chemistry, blood science, bacteriology, and other sciences, and have labs to learn about collecting samples, analyzing lab results, and working with lab equipment.   Some programs will require that you complete an internship or practicum to gain real-world experience. Courses and requirements will vary by program.  , Think about earning a graduate degree if you want to become a laboratory manager or director.A Master’s degree in medical technology, clinical laboratory science, medical research, or a related field can lead to advanced job opportunities and a higher earning potential., Now that you’ve completed your schooling, re-write your list of career goals. Think again about salary, working hours, career advancement, location, and anything else that matters to you. Your ideas and goals may have changed since before you embarked on this career path.   Decide if your needs are flexible or strict, so you can narrow down your job search. For instance, “I will not work on weekends,” or, “I’d like a salary over $xx,xxx, but I’ll accept a position with a lower salary.”  , If you had an internship or a practicum at a hospital, lab, or doctor’s office, check in to see if they’re hiring. Many people get hired at locations that took part in their education – so be sure to be an excellent student!  , Search for a job by word of mouth by asking professionals you know in the field if they’re aware of any job openings. Visit a resume-building website like Monster.com. Go to the website of your local hospital or lab and search for Career Opportunities to look for jobs.   Create your resume beforehand so it’s ready. Write a new cover sheet for every position for which you apply.  , Certification assures potential employers that you are competent, and many employers prefer – or even require – technologists who are certified.The requirements for certification and licensure vary by organization and state, but generally you have to pay a fee and pass an exam.Visit www.ascp.org for the American Society for Clinical Pathology to learn about specific certification requirements through their organization.   Organizations offering certification of medical technologists include the American Society for Clinical Pathology, the American Medical Technologists, the National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel, and the American Association of Bioanalysts. As of 2011, states requiring licensure include: California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, West Virginia and New York. Puerto Rico also requires that medical technologists be licensed.  , As technology advances, you will have to learn to use new equipment and computer programs. Most certifications also require that you complete continuing education hours in order to maintain your certification.You can learn about continuing education opportunities through the major professional organizations.  , While many medical technologists don't specialize, you may be interested in a specific kind of work. In a small laboratory, a medical technologist will do a variety of tests, but in large laboratories, each will have a specific task based on a specialty.   For instance, phlebotomists specialize in collecting blood samples, and histologists concentrate on cutting and staining samples so they can be tested by others.

Take a paper towel or washcloth and wet it with warm water. Then wipe around the cat's eyes. If you don't do this, the discharge can stain your cat's coat and also lead to infections if the cat's eye ducts get blocked up.While cleaning around your cat's eyes, it is a good time to inspect their eyeballs. Exotics can be prone to problems with their corneas, such as scratches or ulcers, so look at their eyes regularly to make sure that the surfaces of their eyes are smooth.; , Even though an exotic shorthair has shorter fur than a Persian, they still need occasional combing to keep their coats in good shape. Combing your cat while it is in a shedding cycle will help to get rid of excess hair before it is all over your house and to keep the cat from ingesting too much, which can lead to hairballs.Use a metal long-toothed comb to comb your cat. These combs are sold at most pet supply stores. If your cat likes to be combed or brushed, you should do it regularly. Just because the coat doesn't require it, that doesn't mean that its not a great bonding activity and you can decrease the amount of fur that is left around your house.  , It is important for you to trim your cat's nails regularly so that they do not get too long. Nails that are too long can be uncomfortable to walk on, can snag furniture, and the snagging can cause the nails to be ripped off. To trim your cats nails, hold the cats paw in one hand and the nail trimmer in your other hand. Only trim the tip of the nail. Not cutting back a lot will help you avoid cutting into the vein in the nail.If you are nervous about trimming your cat's nails, you can have a professional do it. Take your cat to a groomer that is experienced at working with cats or ask for someone at your veterinary office to do it when you take your cat in for an appointment.  , Just as with all cat breeds, giving your exotic shorthair quality cat food will make it healthier and will potentially help it to live a long life. A quality cat food consists of mostly animal tissue, as cats are strictly carnivores. Look at the ingredient list and make sure the food you choose has animal tissues, such as seafood or meat byproducts, as the first couple of ingredients. This will help assure that you are feeding your cat mostly animal tissue.In addition to the ingredients list, make sure that the food you choose is made for your cat's age. Food that is made for kittens, adults, and senior cats is formulated for the specific nutritional needs of those periods of life. In addition to animal tissue, commercial foods may have added vitamins and minerals to give the cat proper nutrition. Choosing between dry, semi-moist, and wet cat food is largely based on what your cat likes. However, wet cat food can be a great source of water for a cat that does not drink a lot of water.  , Cats should have constant access to cool, clean water. They may not drink it constantly but they should have access to it in case they need it.   Many cats are enticed to drink running water. Giving your cat a drinking fountain, which are specialty cat products that recycle a stream of water constantly, may help it to stay hydrated. If your cat is dehydrated and does not want to drink water, consider feeding it wet food. This can give it some vital water., Once you bring home an exotic shorthair cat you should get it checked out by a veterinarian right away. After that, take your cat in for an annual exam. Also, if it has a medical emergency, take it in to be checked out by a veterinarian immediately.   Having an annual exam will allow your veterinarian to spot any potential health problems that may be arising. It will also assure that you are staying up to date on preventative veterinary care, such as vaccinations, that need to be given on a regular basis.  , There are some health problems that exotics commonly have. These include problems with their eyes, respiratory system, kidneys, and the heart. Have your cat screened for these specific problems:Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) Respiratory problems Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  , In an effort to limit pet populations and to keep your cat healthy, it is important to get is spayed or neutered. Desexing your cat can stop a lot of unwanted behavior, such as spraying or mating. In female cats it can also reduce their chance of developing mammary cancer later in life.Discuss when your cat should be spayed or neutered with your veterinarian. In general, it should be done at between three months and six months of age.  , There are a wide variety of dangers outside that can be hazardous to your cat's health. These include cars, diseases, parasites, toxins, and other animals. To avoid these hazards, it's best to just keep your cat inside.Not only does keeping the cat indoors increase its life expectancy, it is good to keep cats inside to protect wildlife, namely native birds. Because exotics are not very active cats, most do not mind staying inside. However, you will need to provide enrichment for them, such as toys and viewing platforms that stimulate their minds.  , Keeping your cat happy and healthy will require that you give it a clean and tidy place to go to the bathroom. This means that you should clean the cat's litterbox daily and use a type of litterbox and litter that the cat likes.If you do not supply a clean and appealing litterbox, your cat may choose to go to the bathroom in other places in your home.  , In order to take proper care of your cat, you will need to give it love and attention. Spend time with it when it comes to you for affection or attention. With an exotic shorthair, you will likely know they want attention when they walk up to you and stare you down. The time you spend with them can be spent petting them or playing games with them.   Exotic shorthair cats can be playful and active at times but they are not this way all of the time. Much of their time is spent on their own and they will not shadow you constantly like some other breeds.  , It is natural for cats to want to scratch. The key is to give them proper surfaces to do it on. Having a scratching post or scratching pad in each room that the cat spends time in will help to keep it from scratching inappropriate surfaces, such as your furniture.You may need to protect your furniture from scratching if your cat has decided it doesn't want to use its scratching post. There are a variety of products that can help you do this, such as sprays that can be applied to furniture that are repellent to cats.  , While an exotic shorthair cat does not usually need constant entertainment, it is important to give them the option of playing or having mental stimulation. Give your cat a variety of toys it can chase and play with. These could include bell balls, fabric mice, laser toys, or strings or puff balls.Additionally, make sure it has access to a window where it can look outside. This will allow the cat to get stimulation from looking at everything going on outside. If your cat seems bored with its existing toys, try getting it a new one. Just like humans, cats can get bored with their toys.

You don’t want to continue using it, especially on your entire face, if it is going to give you an unpleasant reaction.Instead of applying the crème to the entire facial area, only apply a small amount of the peeling formula (Cerate 39XXX) to a small area of your face. It is usually best to choose an area between the chin and the neck. Leave the crème on for 30 minutes, then rinse it off. Wait at least six days before beginning the full course of treatment to ensure that there are no unwanted side effects on the area you tested. Be sure to always only use these products on your face. And don’t apply these products to skin that has been freshly peeled – either from similar products or from damage due to a sunburn.; , Once you have successfully completed the patch test (and waited six days for the results), begin the next step by washing your face with cold water. Be sure to avoid using any soap or cleaner – just cold water – for this part of the process.Pat your skin dry and wait for five minutes before moving on to the next step.  , Apply the entire contents of one of the jars of peeling cream over your entire face using the applicator. Do not rub the cream in. Instead, create a thick coating of the cream on the surface of your facial skin and let it sit there.Upon application of the peeling cream, a hot stinging sensation often occurs. Be sure to avoid contact with the delicate parts of your face – like your eyes, eyelids, lips, and inner nostrils. Make sure you wash your hands after each application. The peeling cream is only intended for use on your face, so you don’t want to leave it on your hands for too long.  , Leave the cream on your face for 90 minutes. Once the time is up, remove the cream with the included applicator. To remove any excess cream, put some Vaseline on your face and wipe it off with tissues or cotton pads.At this stage, your skin may become a deeper red and, in some cases, a dark tan. Your face may also begin to feel tight.  , Wait at least eight hours before rinsing your face after you’ve used the Vaseline to remove the excess peeling cream. Your face needs the Vaseline to keep it supple during this intense peeling process. Once you’ve waited eight hours, you can gently rinse your face with warm water first and then cold water.Be sure to avoid using any soap or cleanser on your face at this point.  , For the first four days of the peel, you’ll need to repeat the above steps (numbers 2 through 5) during each application. This means that each you will clean your face, apply the peeling cream, remove the cream with Vaseline, and rinse your face.   Once you finish the fourth day, you should move on to the second phase.  , Before you begin on days 5 and 6, take a moment to gently rinse your face with warm water, followed by cold water. You can use a washcloth or cotton ball to gently pat the water dry on your facial skin.Be sure to avoid using any cleanser or soap on your face during this part of the process when your facial skin can be so sensitive.  , For days 5 and 6, apply a thick layer (about ¼ of the jar) of the Normalizer Cream to your entire face. Leave it on for 90 minutes and let it soak into your skin.Be very careful not to pick or pull at old skin during this stage as it could cause permanent or unsightly damage to your skin. As your skin continues to peel, keep using the Normalizer Cream every day until the peeling is complete.  , Leave the Normalizer Cream on for 90 minutes and then remove it with cotton balls or tissues. When your skin is done peeling, you may discontinue use of the Normalizer Cream.You may also rinse your face with cool water and pat it dry with a towel. Remember not to use any cleanser or hot water on your face. If peeling continues beyond the sixth day, don’t worry. This is a normal part of the process.  , You need to make sure you are storing these open containers carefully so that no one gets access to them who shouldn’t. You wouldn’t want a beloved child or pet getting a hold of these products and accidentally ingesting or using them.Be sure to store the skin peel products in a cool, dry place. These products should always be stored out of the reach of children.  , While you are using this product, it’s normal to feel a bit of irritation or even a slight burning sensation. However, the peel treatment should not be outright painful. If you begin to feel pain, immediately discontinue use of this product.   Consult a doctor if you are worried about the pain or experience any other concerning side effects.  , During your treatment plan with this product, your face will begin to peel and you’ll need to cut back on other products that you may normally use on your face. Until the peeling process is complete, you shouldn’t apply any other preparations, treatments, soaps, or makeup to your skin., Avoid shaving or waxing your face while using this product. The skin peel takes layers of old skin off of your face, and shaving with a razor could seriously (and easily) damage your currently delicate facial skin. Wait to continue shaving your face until you have completely finished using the skin peel product and have given your face a bit of time to heal.You should also refrain from picking at your skin while using this product. The dead skin should loosen and come off on its own. Picking at it could damage your sensitive skin.  , During this time, especially because your skin is so sensitive, use an SPF15 or higher sunblock on your facial skin. The sunblock will help protect your delicate skin during this transitional time and prevent further damage.   Continue to use the sunblock for at least thirty days after the peeling treatment, regardless of weather conditions.

Learning these commonalities can you help you better understand the process as you work to build your own water pipe. Review the following three main features of a water pipe:Chamber Carburetor Stem and Bowl; , Search for a suitable chamber for your water pipe. The chamber of the water pipe will hold the smoke and water within it and it is the central piece to your pipe. You can use a wide range of materials and objects that you might already have available to you. It is possible to use plastic soda or water bottles for an easy to find chamber. Old glass bottles can be re-purposed to build a chamber for your water pipe.  , Finding materials to use for your stem may prove more difficult than finding materials for your main chamber. Buying a stem from a specialty shop is the easiest way to obtain this element. However, you may still be able to find or buy your own materials and create a stem for yourself.A length of copper pipe can be used to make the stem of your water pipe. Brass fittings can be glued or otherwise affixed to the stem to create a bowl. If you don't have a smoke shop nearby or any suitable items around your house, try visiting a hardware store.  , The bowl is the piece of your water pipe that will hold whatever legal substance you decide to smoke. Most store bought bowls will be made out of glass which can be difficult to make at home unless you've had previous experience. However, there are other methods and materials that you can make use of around your home to build your bowl.Aluminum foil can be used as a bowl, bending it into shape and poking many small holes into the bottom of it with a pin. You can try making a stem and bowl combination out of certain metal doorstops as well. Remove the door stop from the wall and take off the rubber stopper to create your stem and bowl.  , Once you have selected your chamber you will need to create a hole for the stem. Pay careful attention to exactly where you place this hole and the angle of it, as this will affect how your stem fits. Depending on the material you have selected for your chamber the tool you will use to make this hole will vary.Make this hole on the side of your chamber, at about half the length of the chamber. Create this hole at an angle that will allow the stem to reach the bottom of the chamber. A plastic chamber can be punctured with a pair of scissors. Metal and glass chambers may need a power drill to make the hole for the stem.  , After creating a hole for your stem you will now need to insert the stem through and into the chamber. The stem should pass through the side wall of your chamber, reaching down at an angle to touch the bottom of the chamber. Once inserted you will seal your stem in place to prevent any spots where air or smoke might leak through.Apply silicone around the area where the stem meets the chamber to create a seal. You can also insert a rubber grommet into your stem hole before inserting your stem through it.  , A carburetor is usually a small hole on the side of a water pipe that can help you control the amount of smoke in the main chamber. Creating a small hole for your carburetor can help you get the most out of your homemade water pipe.The carburetor should be made on the opposite side of the stem. Carburetors are usually found slightly below the point where the stem enters the chamber. The size of your carburetor should be just big enough to cover it with your thumb.  , The purpose of water in a water pipe is to cool the temperate of smoke down before it is inhaled. The smoke is drawn in and down through the stem, passing through the water before going up the main chamber. Add water to your pipe to create a more comfortable temperature smoke when in use.   Water should go directly into the main body of the chamber. Add enough water to cover most of the stem inside the chamber. Don't overfill with water as it may spill out of the carburetor or rise up the stem.  , Apple pipes can be a quick and easy pipe to make if you find yourself without your usual smoking equipment. To build an apple pipe all you will need is an apple, a pen, aluminum foil and a knife.Core out the center of the apple to make an inner chamber. Take apart the pen and use only the empty pen tube. Push the pen tube into the apple's side until it enters the cored out chamber you've made. Make an aluminum bowl over the top hole you have created. Shape a piece of aluminum into the form you need and punch multiple holes into it with a pin to create the bowl. Add your smoking material to the bowl, light it, and inhale through the pen.  , Gravity pipes work by using mechanical action to pull smoke from your combustible substance, instead of using your lungs. Once smoke has filled the chamber the bowl is removed, allowing you to inhale the smoke. All you will need is a plastic two liter soda bottle, scissors, and something to make a bowl such as aluminum foil.Cut the two liter bottle in half. Insert the lower section inside of the top section and push the top section down until it touches meets the bottom of the lower section. Make sure the two halves fit tightly to create an air tight seal. Create your aluminum bowl by molding the aluminum into a shape that fits the top opening of the soda bottle. Make sure to punch small holes into your bowl with a pin. Add your smoking material to the bowl and light it. As it burns, pull the top half of the bottle upwards, drawing the smoke into the inner chamber. Take away the bowl and inhale the smoke that has collected inside your gravity pipe.  , A waterfall pipe works similarly to a gravity pipe. However, instead of pulling the smoke into the chamber manually, the flow of water from the main chamber will create the smoke. All you need to get started is a plastic two liter soda bottle, something to make a hole in the bottle, and aluminum to create a bowl.Punch a hole near the bottom of your soda bottle. It should be big enough to cover with a finger and hold the water in the chamber until you are ready to let it flow out. Build a bowl using your aluminum foil. Form the aluminum into a shape that fits the top spout of the bottle and punch holes into it with a pin. Fill the bottle up with water, making sure the hole is plugged up completely. Place your bowl on top of the waterfall pipe and light your smoking material. Unplug the lower hole, allowing the water to flow out and draw in the smoke. Remove your bowl and inhale the smoke that is now in the chamber.

Confidential. You can access material that could cause measurable damage if improperly disclosed. Most military personnel get this clearance. Secret. You can gain access to material that could cause serious damage to national security if it were disclosed improperly. Top secret. You can access to information or material that could cause exceptionally grave damage to the nation’s security if improperly disclosed.; , You will need to complete the Personal Security Questionnaire, SF-86, online.This form will ask for substantial amounts of information, such as where you’ve lived and worked for the past 10 years and your relationship with family members. Answer all questions honestly and thoroughly.Talk to your company’s Facility Security Officer (FSO) for information on accessing the questionnaire.  , The application will request work, school, and personal references. It will also ask for the names of neighbors and landlords. If possible, you should avoid naming family members. Also try not to list someone as a reference more than once.   For personal references, you should name at least one person who has known you for the past seven years. This person should also know your other friends.After you complete the questionnaire, the FSO will review it and then forward it to the Department of Defense Central Adjudication Facilities (DoDCAF). If they approve it, they forward it on to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which will conduct your background check., A background check must be performed before you can be approved for a clearance. You will be told where to go to give your fingerprints. You may need to go to the police station, or the agency requiring the clearance might fingerprint you., The investigator will perform a criminal and credit check. They will also send inquiries to employers, schools, and references to confirm information. If you are seeking a Top Secret clearance, then the investigator may also interview employers, references, and others.Investigators can also look at your social media profiles, such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.Make your profiles private if you don’t want anyone seeing anything embarrassing.  , Within a few weeks of submitting your application, you will attend an interview with the investigator.You will go through the information on your application. The interviewer may also ask you to bring supporting documents, such as your Social Security card, passport, or birth certificate.   You will also be asked questions about anything from your background check that has raised a security concern.  , For example, you might be currently living with a non-citizen or have a family member who has close ties to a foreign country.You can expect the investigator to ask you questions about these circumstances.   You won’t automatically be disqualified from a security clearance for these reasons. For example, you might have been involved in seditious activities mostly out of curiosity and only for a brief period of time. The government might need to investigate any non-citizen you are close with to determine they are not an agent of a foreign power.  , Alcohol and substance abuse are red flags for the investigator. You may need to discuss these issues, especially if you’ve been diagnosed as dependent on drugs or alcohol or been convicted of a crime while high or intoxicated.You can lessen the seriousness by showing that your involvement was not recent or that it was an isolated incident. Also let the investigator know if you’ve completed a treatment program, such as Alcoholics Anonymous.  , The investigator will look to see whether you have engaged in a pattern of behavior that shows emotional instability. Examples include compulsive sexual behavior, failure to take prescription medications, or high-risk and aggressive behavior.You should explain to the investigator that there is no current problem. Ideally, you will also have a recent opinion from mental health professional stating that your behavior is not likely to occur again. You should also explain if your past behavior resulted from a temporary problem, such as a divorce or the death of a loved one.  , Financial difficulties can raise red flags for an investigator, because someone who is financially distressed is more likely to disclose confidential information for money. A history of defaulting on loans will cause concern.You can lessen the seriousness of financial difficulties by pointing out how they were beyond your control. For example, you might have gone into debt because of a medical emergency or unemployment. You can also explain how you made a good faith effort to pay your debts back.  , The investigator will closely review your entire criminal history, so be prepared to discuss any crime you have been convicted of or even charged with.   Try to put your criminal history in context. For example, explain if the behavior was isolated and a long time ago. These facts can lessen any security concerns the investigator will have.If you were acquitted, point out that fact. However, you shouldn’t insist you were innocent if you were convicted. That sounds like you are trying to avoid responsibility for the crime. Also explain how you have rehabilitated yourself. For example, point to your solid work history and recent clean criminal record.  , Your hiring office might request that you receive an interim security clearance. They are given only in exceptional circumstances, but you can get one within a few weeks of submitting your complete security package.Your FSO should be able to tell you whether they are seeking an interim security clearance.  , DoDCAF reviews the results of the investigation and decides to either grant you a clearance or not. It shouldn’t take longer than three months to receive your clearance, from start to finish.  , You will receive a Statement of Reasons (SOR) if you are denied. This document will identify every reason that has prevented you from obtaining a clearance. You’ll also be told how to submit a written rebuttal and/or request a hearing.In your rebuttal, you will need to explain or deny each reason stated in the SOR. For example, you might be denied because you have a home in foreclosure. You can provide context by showing how an illness caused you to fall behind on your mortgage payments. Find supporting documentation, such as medical records. Consider hiring an attorney or security clearance consultation to help you respond to the denial. It’s possible to convince the agency that you are qualified for a security clearance, but you’ll probably need expert help.  , Your clearance is only good for a certain amount of time. Before it expires, you must submit a new security package and have another background check. You will be reinvestigated according to the following timetable:Confidential clearance: every 15 years. Secret clearance: every 10 years. Top secret clearance: every 5 years.

You'd probably want your students to quiet down and do their work, too. Try to imagine how your teacher must feel on a daily basis to give you some clues on how to act, if you want your teacher to like you.   Try to take it easy on your teacher. Don't make your teacher have to work harder than they already have to. Every time you have an excuse or a favor or a request you have to make for your teacher, that's more work for them. Give them less to do.; , There's no one way to please all your teachers, since all your teachers will be completely different people. Some will be kind, easy-going, and warm, while others will seem like stern, old-school taskmasters. Try to get a read on who your teacher is, what they like, and what makes them tick, to learn more.   If your teacher is stern, sucking up won't do you much good. Focus on your work, putting your head down, and doing what's expected, not in being a big presence in class. If your teacher is kind of warm, they'll likely more appreciate the talkers in class. If you want the teacher to like you, open up and talk a bit more and have a short conversation with the teacher if necessary, as well as doing your work as well as you can.  , Contrary to what you might think, teachers don't like brown-noses, suck-ups, or annoying tattle-tales. The person in your class you think is the ""teacher's pet"" according to the students is probably not most teacher's favorite student. Keep that in mind.   It's not necessary to be the most talkative, or to ask more questions than everyone else. Just make sure that you contribute sometimes and that you keep the classroom positive.  , If you want to go the extra mile, it's helpful to have a creative spin to put on your work to help yourself stand out from the rest of the students and interesting, creative, and likable. Think of creative projects when you get projects, or do your in-class work in different ways than everyone else. Try to hard and do more than the minimum.   Imagine this: your teacher has to sit down and grade twenty, fifty, even a couple hundred papers at night. How boring if they're all exactly the same. But if you can inject a bit of your own personality and creativity into your work (as long as you follow instructions and do the work you're supposed to do), most teachers will like that.  , Be honest when you're in school. As you get older and go through school, teachers will respect students who learn to think for themselves, not students who just repeat what they've heard. If you display, at any age, that you're a creative, independent thinker, that'll be something to respect.   Speaking your mind doesn't mean being a troublemaker in class. If you don't want to do the homework because it's boring, that's not going to win you any points.  , At some point in your time as a student, you should pick a teacher that you especially like and say, ""Thank you."" It's hard work being a teacher, and they'll appreciate your appreciation.   In some cases, small gifts can be appropriate ways of saying thanks, but some teachers might take offense, if the gift seems overly elaborate, expensive, or fancy. Gifts should not seem like bribes. In some cultures, it's appropriate and quite common to invite your teacher to dinner with your family. Extending an invitation can be a polite way of saying thanks.  , The single best way to get any teacher to look on you favorably is to pay attention in class. The more you pay attention and listen closely, the easier it will be for you to settle down when you're supposed to, and do your best work possible.   If you struggle to pay attention in class, talk to your parents and your teacher to let them know. It's possible you may not being challenged enough, or might have some behavioral problems that need help so you can do your best. Even though it's fun to sit next to your friends, try to hang out with them at recess, on the bus, and during passing periods. It might be better to sit away from them in class, to avoid the temptation to fool around. You might miss important things.  , When you're in school, you need to do what you're supposed to do as quickly and quietly as possible. If it's time to put away your things and go to lunch, that doesn't mean it's time to joke with your neighbor and stick your gum under the desk. Listen and follow instructions.   Follow your teacher's instructions when you're not in the classroom as well. If you have to read a chapter from a book for class tomorrow, do it. Don't skip assignments and think the teacher will like you because you're friendly. Just do your work.  , It's very important that you be respectful and kind to not only your teacher, but to everyone else in class as well. Treat the other people in your class like you would want to be treated at all times.   Don't talk in class when it's not the right time. Teachers will not be happy at improper interruptions. Some kids think pushing the teachers buttons is a good way of getting other kids to like them, but this is disrespectful to everyone, especially the teacher.  , When you're in class, you need to do more than just sit silently and pay attention. Often, your teacher will ask for volunteers, or ask questions of the group, and it's important to speak up at appropriate times. Work hard to make the class environment positive.   Work in small groups politely. When it's time to break into groups, do your part in the group to help the task along, not make trouble, interrupt, or just sit and wait for the other students to do your work for you. If you see other students around you acting up or talking, you don't need to make a big deal of it, but you can also help keeping class moving forward by putting your nose down and doing the work. Don't let yourself get distracted.  , Take pride in keeping your desk, locker, coat space in the coat closet, and whatever other space you've got in the classroom and orderly and clean as possible. Your teacher isn't your parent, and shouldn't have to clean up after you on a regular basis. There's no better way to make your teacher not like you, than to make a big mess in the classroom.  , During class, focus and do your in-class assignments as best as possible, follow instructions that you've been given, and turn in your work. Getting your teacher happy doesn't need to be much more complicated than that.   When you get homework assignments, save enough time to finish them efficiently. A good way to tick off your teacher is doing your homework last minute, right before you turn it in. Never, under any circumstances, should you cheat or copy answers from someone in your class. That's a good way to get in trouble.  , Teachers like a student who joins in when it's time, and not just sits in the back of the room, head down. Ask intelligent or meaningful questions. Show you are listening while your teacher is talking.   Often, if you have a question, a bunch of other students will have the same question, they're just too afraid to ask it. Being willing to ask questions will help to make your teacher like you.  , This should be an easy one. When you go to class and interact with your teacher, Try to put yourself at ease and just be yourself. If you try to be pretend to be someone you're not, your teacher will be able to tell. Don't just try to be a teacher's pet, a know-it-all, or too-cool-for-school. Just be you.   Teachers are like anyone else: they like people to be genuine, kind, and real. Don't mistake yourself into thinking that you need to be a certain way to get teachers to like you. Just don't act up to get attention, and you'll be well-liked by teachers.  , Try hard in school and only turn in your best work. If teachers think that you're capable of more in class, they'll be unhappy if you're not trying hard. Don't mail it in. Really set aside enough time to get your work done at a high level. Go the extra mile on homework assignments.   If you're struggling in class, tell your teacher that you want to do better, and ask for help. At lots of schools, there are after-school homework groups, study sessions, and other ways that you can get extra work done, if you make the effort. Teachers respect effort.

While the increased interest in popcorn shoots have lead to more specialized popcorn seeds that are meant for shoot production, you standard popcorn seeds will grow shoots too! In fact, the ones meant for movie night will end up tasting much like the popcorn snack you’re used to, with an added dose of sweetness., More and more interest in popcorn shoots (as opposed to traditional popcorn) has led some seed purveyors to package and sell popcorn seeds specifically for growing shoots. Admittedly, these are preferable to the seeds sold for use as actual popcorn, as they will be free of things like salt, preservatives, and flavoring.These seeds even come in separate colors, though you’re more likely to find the white and yellow varieties, as opposed to the oft-sought red variety. Do a quick online search for popcorn shoot seeds or visit your local health food store to see if they carry them. Note that many seed website sell sprouting kits. These will come with everything you need, including a tray and a container to sprout the seeds prior to planting.  , If you get a package of seeds meant to be grown, the package will likely contain information about how much to use, such as one bag for a specifically sized tray. To help establish the correct amount, spread dry seed into the bottom of the empty tray you’ll use to grow the shoots. They should be evenly but densely spread, just barely covering the bottom surface of the tray.As a general guideline, use 1/4-1/3 cup for a 5x5in (13x13cm) tray. Use 1-1 1/2 cup for an 10x10in (25x25cm) tray, and 2-3 cups for a tray that’s 10x20in (25x50cm). If you’re growing your seeds in a hot, humid climate, you may need to use a bit less seed. While plenty of seeds usually works wonderfully, mold may be more likely to grow between closely-spaced shoots in more tropical climates.  , Place the seeds you’ll be planting in a bowl or jar. Add twice or three times the volume of seeds in water. The water should be neither cold nor hot. Sixty to seventy degrees Fahrenheit is ideal (16-21 degrees Celsius). After mixing the seeds gently to ensure water has made contact with each seed, allow them to sit for eight to twelve hours.As they soak, keep the seeds out of direct sunlight. They don’t need to be in complete darkness, but put them somewhere indoors where they won’t be disturbed and where the temperature is constant.  , After carefully draining the water from the soaked seeds, rinse them in cool (60-70°F/16-21°C) water and drain thoroughly. Then simply place the seeds in your sprouter and set the sprouter somewhere indoors and out of direct sunlight.Light doesn’t matter much to a plant before it has leaves. Temperature does though; keep your sprouter somewhere close to 70°F (21°C). There are all sorts of manual sprouters, including both jars and bags. Visit a local gardening store or check out your options online., Your seeds are about ready to burst and begin to sprout. You can help them do so by rinsing several times over the next few days. In fact, rinse and drain your seeds every eight to twelve hours with cool water. You’ll likely do about three total rinses and drains before the seeds sprout.Once most of the seeds start showing their roots, they’re ready to plant. Try to catch them before roots are more than a ¼ of an inch (~½ a cm) long.  , In growing vernacular, “medium” refers to the material in which you’ll grow your shoots. Soil is a classic example, and may the easiest to work with for most first time growers. The amount of medium you’ll need depends on the type you choose. Keep in mind that the medium’s job is to hold your sprouts in place and provide them with water.Other medium options for plants like popcorn shoots include ""baby blankets"" and Vermiculite. Baby blankets are actually a pad-like material that can be cut to the shape of the wells in your planting tray. While Vermiculite in particular is great at retaining moisture, both of these options are more expensive than soil, require more particular watering methods, and require the use of fertilizer.  , If you use soil, the amount you use isn’t as important as keeping it wet. The more you use, the more water the soil will hold, and the less often you need to water the plants. However, more soil also means you have to do more careful mixing when you do add water. Essentially, you want all of the soil to be wet, but without water puddling on the surface of the soil.Use your fingers to disperse water throughout the soil when you water the plants. Mix earthworm castings, which can be found online or at gardening stores, into your soil for added nutrients. Wet the castings before mixing them into your soil, and keep your medium beneath 20% earthworms castings.  , Try to spread the seeds as evenly as possible. Some shoot-growers contend that you don’t want seeds to be touching, but it’s probably okay if they touch and overlap a little bit.If, during your first grow, you have issues with mold or fungus growing between your shoots, use less seeds the next time around. This is more likely in hot, humid climates, where you’ll want to disperse seeds more thinly.  , Use a cover tray, which will be lightweight but impermeable to light, to cover the seeded tray and protect your growing plants from light and moisture. It’s worth using a cover tray that is designed to be compatible with your planting tray; you can purchase them together from gardening stores or online.Note that cover trays have small holes or slits to allow minimal air circulation. This can help prevent mold or fungus. Keep the tray somewhere indoors with little light and a constant temperature. While 70°F (21°C) is ideal, a slightly warmer or cooler temperature is fine. Consistency is more important.  , Essentially, keep the medium moist, as this will facilitate your plants’ ability to set their roots and grow. This will likely require small amounts of watering once or twice per day. Use a gentle sprayer, such as a spray bottle or a hose handle set very low, and make sure to spray each sprouting plant each time you water.Once you’re sure the roots have set, focus on keeping the medium moist. This no longer requires spraying every plant. In fact, spray water in from the sides to avoid damaging the tender shoots as they grow taller.  , If you want your popcorn shoots to be green, they will need to spend a while in the sun. After three or four days (or when the plants are pushing the covering tray up), move the planting try to a location that receives direct sunlight. Keep in mind that shoots that are grown fully in the dark may be more tender and have a more delicate flavor.Note that you will likely need to water more frequently when the plants are in the sun. Keep the medium moist to help them grow. If you do not green your shoots, they will stay a pale yellow color once harvested.  , Once you’re ready to harvest, take care not to get the shoots themselves wet for a few hours, as they will store better if the shoots are dry. If you need to water, do so by pouring water directly into the tray. Once shoots are dry to the touch, simply cut the plants at just about the medium’s surface.Store shoots in a sealed container in your fridge. Ideally, use a produce storage bag, as they can extend the shoot’s shelf life. These bags can be purchased online, as well as at some specialty gardening stores.

"['use an iron made of a high quality material', 'opt for an iron that has adjustable temperature controls', 'consider the size of your iron', 'dry your hair completely', 'apply a heat protectant', 'heat each section of hair briefly', 'use a moisturizing shampoo', 'deep condition your hair weekly', 'moisturize your hair with oil', 'get regular trims']",How to Keep Hair Healthy when Using Irons Daily," If you’re going to use a straightening or curling iron on your hair daily, it’s important that to select one that’s made with a material that will do the least damage to your hair. Inexpensive irons are usually made with metal that doesn’t heat evenly so it can easily burn your hair. You'll pay more for an iron made with a higher quality material, but it will help minimize damage.Ceramic irons heat quickly and evenly, so they’re not as likely to burn your hair. They also produce negative ions that help smooth cuticle and boost shine. Be sure to choose an iron that’s made of ceramic and not just coated with it. A ceramic coating will eventually wear off over time. Tourmaline irons can produce 6 times the amount of negative ions that ceramic models do. As a result, you’re left with smooth, shiny, healthy looking hair. Titanium irons are usually the most expensive, but they heat quickly and evenly. They’re a particularly good option for thick or coarse hair.; , Many straightening and curling irons only have low, medium, and high heat settings. To keep your hair from getting damaged, you want to use the lowest heat possible to give you your desired style. That’s why it’s best to purchase an iron with digital heat controls that allow you to choose a specific temperature to heat to.In general, an iron that allows you to set the temperature between 175 degrees to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees to 200 degrees Celsius) is sufficient for all hair types. The finer or thinner your hair is, the lower the temperature on your iron should be. Start at 175 degrees (80 degrees Celsius), and only raise the temperature if your hair isn’t curling or straightening properly. No matter how thick or coarse your hair is, you should never set your iron to higher than 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).  , The size of your straightening or curling iron can also affect how damaged your hair becomes. If you use a larger iron, you’re less likely to need to go over the same section of hair twice to curl or straighten it properly. In general, a 1-inch (23-mm) curling or straightening iron is the most versatile for all hair types.If you have a shorter hair, you may want to use a smaller iron. If you have extremely thick or long hair, you may want to use a larger iron. When it comes to curling iron, it’s also important to consider the hairstyle that you’re going for. If you want tight ringlet curls, you’ll want to use a smaller curling iron. If you want loose waves, you’ll want to use a larger curling iron.  , Before you use any type of iron on your hair, it’s crucial that you dry it first. If your hair is wet when you apply heat to it, you will literally boil the moisture out of it and do serious damage. Allow your hair to dry completely before you pick up your iron.Because you’ll be applying heat to your hair with the iron, it’s best to air dry your hair before styling it. Using a blow dryer on your tresses means that you’ll be treating it with a double dose of heat, which can do more damage.  , Before you use your curling or straightening iron, you want to protect your hair so it won’t lose too much moisture from the heat. Work a heat protectant product through all of your hair -- it will coat your locks so they don’t lose their natural moisture.For fine or thin hair, a heat protectant spray is usually the best option. For thick or coarse hair, a heat protectant oil, cream, or lotion is usually the best option. Look for a heat protectant that contains humectants, such as panthenol and propylene glycol, to lock in moisture, and silicones, such as amodimethicone and dimethicone, to provide insulation from the high temperatures.When you’re curling or straightening your hair, it’s a good idea to use a heat protectant product that also has some hold to it so you can lock in the curls or straightness.  , If you leave the iron on any one section of hair for too long, you run the risk of burning it. To avoid damage, never leave the curling or flat iron on a single section of hair for more than 3 to 5 seconds.When you’re straightening your hair, be sure to keep the iron moving over to avoid heating any one spot for too long.  , Heat styling with an iron strips your hair of the natural moisture that keeps it healthy. To keep your hair hydrated, switch to a moisturizing shampoo that will clean your locks while also delivering moisture-rich ingredients. Look for a formula that contains natural oils such as argan or coconut.Be sure to use a sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfates help create lather for shampoos, but they’re also very drying.  , While you should use a traditional conditioner each time you shampoo your hair, it’s also important to deliver a more intense dose of hydration at least once a week. Using a deep conditioner or a hair mask, which contains hydrating ingredients such as argan oil, coconut oil, shea butter, and keratin, can help keep your hair moisturized even if you heat style everyday. Apply it once a week for the best results.Consult the instructions on the deep conditioner’s packaging to determine the correct way to use it. Most formulas require putting in on wet, freshly shampooed hair and allowing it to sit for 20 to 30 minutes before washing it out. If you have extremely dry, thick, or coarse hair, you may want to use the deep conditioner every time that you wash your hair.  , Both traditional and deep conditioners are washed out of the hair, so their moisturizing effects don’t always last all day. After you wash your hair, apply a hair oil to your locks to keep them hydrated throughout the day.Squeeze several drops of the oil into your palm, and rub it between your hands. Gently smooth the hands over your hair and work the oil through your entire head. If you have fine or thin hair, rosemary and pomegranate seed oils are good options. If you have thick or coarse hair, avocado, coconut, and olive oils are good options.  , The ends of your hair are the spot that’s going to show the damaged from heat styling the most quickly with spilt ends and breakage. By getting your hair trimmed every 6 to 8 weeks, you’ll remove the damaged hair so your locks look healthier overall.When you get your hair cut, it’s a good idea to ask your stylist for tips on keeping your hair healthy. She might be able to provide tips for using irons on your particular type and style of hair, so you can minimize damage.

Men who have hereditary diseases are excluded, as are those with chronic debilitating diseases (such as diabetes, cancer or chronic fatigue), due to the negative impact on sperm production and motility. You also cannot have any exposure to the following infectious diseases: HIV, hepatitis B and C, HTLV, syphilis, genital herpes and/or genital warts.Heterosexuality matters because homosexual men (or those who engage in same-sex practices occasionally) are at much higher risks of being exposed to or infected with STDs and various other pathogenic viruses and bacteria. Blood samples are routinely taken for examination prior to acceptance.  At sperm banks, sperm health is often defined as a sperm count of at least 70 million/ml, at least 70% motility and at least 60% normal in appearance (morphology).As a general rule, sperm health in sperm donors needs to be better than average because some sperm die or lose their motility in the freezing and thawing processes. Common hereditary diseases include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia and inflammatory arthritis.; , Although sperm banks and fertility clinics all have slightly different policies in terms of sperm donor qualifications, almost all require that you be younger than 40 years old.Some men produce completely healthy sperm beyond the age of 40, but many have lower sperm counts and reduced sperm motility, which makes it less likely to lead to impregnation. Lifestyle, diet and overall health are sometimes better indicators of sperm health than chronological age.   The age limit for some facilities can be as low as 35 years. At the other end of the spectrum, the minimum age requirement is usually either 19 or 20 years. Male sperm donors are usually paid between $50-100 USD per viable sample.  , In addition to age, there are height restrictions of who can donate sperm in the U.S. and many other countries. Shorter men don't have more issues with their sperm compared to tall men, but the recipients of the sperm almost always request taller donors, so the sperm banks and fertility clinic comply with their wishes. Many facilities require that their sperm donors be between 5'10"" and 6'2"", although others maintain that you must be at least 5'9"" to qualify — the average height for American men. Short height is often a function of genetics, although environmental factors (poor nutrition as a child, infections, exposure to toxins) can play a significant role also. Taller children tend to fit in better among their peers (assuming they're not giants) and eventually have a higher probability of success with dating, marriage and mating., Obviously many men who don't attend university or college are highly intelligent or even geniuses, but almost all sperm banks and fertility clinics require proof of enrollment or completion of post-secondary education.In fact, some sperm banks only accept donors who are graduates of Ivy League schools and then market that information to justify their higher costs. Regardless, if you are not formerly educated in some capacity, there's virtually no chance of being accepted as a sperm donor.   Perhaps interestingly, university and college grades or performance almost never matter to sperm banks or fertility clinics (nor other achievements that require intelligence), it's just the admission and/or completion of a program that matter. Between 50-80% percent of sperm within a sample of ejaculate do not survive the freezing process at sperm banks and fertility clinics., Almost no sperm banks or fertility clinics accept donors who are intent on going through the process only once. Instead, most want a commitment in terms of frequency of visits (weekly or bi-weekly) and time (1-year contracts are common).Most companies feel that commitment to their timetables represents stability, plus they have the opportunity to monitor and compare sperm samples for quality and evidence of poor health or bad lifestyle changes. For example, blood and sperm samples are routinely screened for illicit drug use, which can alter and damage sperm.   All sorts of hair and eye colors are encouraged, with the possible exception of red hair at some clinics. It appears that people who buy donated sperm prefer red hair the least. Because Caucasian (light-skinned people) tend to use donated sperm the most, Caucasian sperm donors represent the majority. However, in some geographic markets, African Americans and Asian Americans may be in high demand., After meeting the initial requirements of age, height, health and sexual practices, sperm donor candidates then progress to the screening and interview process in order to substantiate their claims and get a better feel for their personality and willingness to make a commitment If you haven't already filled one out, you'll need to complete a thorough medical history questionnaire of not just your own, but also your immediate family. The questionnaire is followed sometimes by a personal interview and then blood and semen samples. If accepted a legally binding contract has to be signed.   People who are adopted are often disqualified from being a sperm donor because their family history cannot be substantiated or verified. Mental health can also sometimes be an issue because some conditions, such as schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder, may have genetic links. Sometimes multiple samples are needed to best establish sperm count and motility rates.  , Because your sperm count, motility and overall morphology is a crucial aspect of being accepted as a sperm donor, take it seriously and try to give the best sample you can. Donors are typically asked to abstain from ejaculation (from sex or masturbation) for at least 2 days (sometimes up to 5 days) before giving a sperm sample in order to get the highest counts possible.Prior to giving a sperm sample, get a good night's sleep, avoid alcohol and cigarette smoke, drink plenty of water and eat a nutritious meal.   Supplements that can help improve the health of your sperm include zinc, selenium, folic acid, vitamin E and L-carnitine. Most sperm banks and fertility clinics ask for weekly sperm deposits because it can take as many as 8 inseminations for a woman to become pregnant., To ensure that it's your sperm sample, most sperm banks and fertility clinics require you to ejaculate while in their premises. Clinical settings are not known for their sexual atmosphere, so you'll have to learn to control your feelings of nervousness / awkwardness and rely more on your imagination. Most facilities provide pornographic material to increase arousal, but the increasing usage of porn in the U.S. has dulled many men to its effects.Furthermore, you can't use any lubricants (even saliva or water) to masturbate due to their potentially negative effects on sperm health. As such, rely on vivid sexual imagery in your own head and consider bringing to the clinic a device that stimulates your genitals in some capacity, such as vibrator.   After the initial STD screening, sperm samples are quarantined and typically frozen for 6 months. Then, before use, the sperm sample is tested again to ensure safety from pathogens. Sperm banks tend to be very protective of its donors' rights and confidentiality, and they have no legal rights or responsibilities for kids conceived from their sperm.

This includes not just the coffee maker and coffee themselves but everything you need to make the perfect cup of coffee. How you design, arrange, and install your coffee station depends on how much has to go in it. You may include:Coffee makers, including single cup coffee makers, espresso machines, drip coffee, French presses, or any other coffee making equipment you own Cups, mugs, teacups, and saucers Sugar and other flavorings, such as syrups, dried creamer, or cinnamon Coffee Grinders Trays Spoons; , There are hundreds of photos, Pinterest boards, design blogs, and home magazines that have examples of both professional and amateur coffee station designs.Look for your favorite examples, and use these pictures to brainstorm how you might design your own. If there is a particular feature that you like about a coffee station, take note of it. Try to think about how you can use that in your own kitchen.  , You will need to find which area of the kitchen you want to dedicate to your coffee station. This should be a clear surface with access to an outlet. Once you have determined which space you are going to use, you should measure it so you know how much room you have to store your things.   Countertop space is great to use for a coffee station. Make sure you have enough room for your equipment. If you are limited on counter space, try organizing everything on a single tray. Place that tray on your counter. This will help you confine your coffee supplies to a limited area.If you can’t use counter space, you may want to invest in a sofa table, side bar, food cart, or hutch. The surface should be at a convenient height. You can move this surface anywhere in your kitchen where you have sufficient space and access to an outlet.Some people use built-in cabinets for their coffee station. If you want an uncluttered look, you can remove the shelves from a cabinet, and place your coffee makers, cups, and ingredients inside. Make sure that the cabinet is at a convenient height for you to make coffee., The equipment itself should remain on the counter or table surface, but everything else can be stored elsewhere if you decide. If you’re short on space, you may want to think of other storage options. You might consider:   Installing hooks on the wall for your cups and mugs. Building shelves above the station for cups and ingredients. Using cabinets above and below the station for storage., If your kitchen has a theme to it, you should try to think about how your coffee station might fit within the larger design scheme. Try to match the color scheme, theme, and organizational pattern of your larger kitchen.   If you have a minimalist kitchen, you may not want a cluttered coffee station. Hide your supplies in cabinets, or try to build the coffee station within a cabinet. If you have a small kitchen and not enough counter space, try to find a corner where you can place your coffee station. This will make appear as though the coffee station is not taking up too much room.If your kitchen follows an industrialist or modern theme, you might want to use steel canisters for your ingredients. Try to find a design that utilizes straight lines.  , If you are planning on adding hooks, shelves, or cabinets for your station, you should install them before setting up the station itself. Place the coffee maker where you think you might put it, and mark its height on the wall with a pencil. This will help you measure where you can install shelves or hooks. You should not build it right at the mark but rather start measuring your shelves and cabinets from above this mark.   If you are installing hooks for mugs, use rounded hooks. Nail them into the wall. Do not use adhesive tape for your hooks, as they may not be strong enough to hold mugs. You can nail the hooks below a wall-mounted cabinet or buy premade mug racks., If you are using an electric coffee maker, you should go ahead and place it where you think it will be most convenient. Make sure that its cord can reach the outlet. You will arrange all of your other supplies around the coffee maker.   If you are using a manual maker, such as a French press or pour over drip brew, you should still organize the space around the equipment. You may have more flexibility, however, in where you put your coffee maker.  , At this point, you can start adding in your cups, sugar, creamers, syrups, and the coffee itself. Arrange these items as you please around the coffee maker using the storage options you have chosen.If you are using hooks for your mugs, place the mug’s handle on the hook. It should hang slightly tilted to the side. If you don’t already, you may want to consider buying airtight jars to store your coffee, sugar, and other powdered ingredients in. This will help the coffee station look less cluttered and more put together.  , The coffee station should make you happy. It should be convenient for making coffee, but you may also want it to be neat, uncluttered, or stylish. Make a cup of coffee using your coffee station to see how easy and convenient it is. If it does not work, take some time to reorganize the coffee bar.   If you are having trouble reaching the coffee maker or if there is not enough space for you to use it correctly, you may need to shift where you place it. If you need more space for your coffee maker and cups, consider storing the ingredients in a cabinet or pantry. If the space you have chosen is not working out, you may need to move the entire station to another place within the kitchen.  , If your kitchen has neutral tones or if you do not have a color scheme for your kitchen, a color station is a great place to add a burst of color. Choose a bright color that you enjoy, and think about how you might incorporate it in your coffee station. You may want to stick to a single color theme, unless your kitchen has a larger pattern that you are using.   If you are using a cart or side table for your coffee station, you can paint it with your desired color.If you are using counter space, you may want to incorporate this color into the cups, jars, and plates that you use. You can even paint a tray your desired color. Place the coffee maker and other items on top of this tray., A chalkboard will give you an authentic feeling of a café at home. You can buy and hang a chalkboard on the wall. Alternatively, you can paint your own by painting the wall directly.Use two coats of chalkboard paint, waiting for the paint to dry between layers. Invest in some chalk so you can draw and write to your pleasure.   You can write inspirational quotes, funny drawings, your daily schedule, or notes to your family on the chalkboard.  , If you are not using your wall space, the area above the coffee station is a great place to hang art. Find a piece of art that fits in with your kitchen’s theme or the colors of your coffee station.Some ideas include:   Ceramic tiles or a mosaic A hand-painted sign about your love of coffee A clock A wall decal Vintage café boards, What you store your ingredients in can help bring out the character of your coffee station. Find jars for your coffee beans, grounds, sugar, dried creamers, spices, and anything else you like to put in your coffee.You can use:   Glass jars and containers Vintage tins Painted ceramic jars Antique sugar bowls Steel canisters  , If you have free space above your coffee station, you can put up a string of lights to make it cheerful. This will also give you some extra illumination when you are making your coffee. String lights are a great addition to any kitchen, as they can create atmosphere at night and wake you up in the morning.

"['write your return address (and', 'optionally', 'your name) in the top left corner', 'write the date below your contact information', 'write the ""inside address"" below the date', 'consider using an alternate header arrangement', 'for casual letters', 'simply write the date alone', 'skip a line after the header to position the salutation properly', 'when in doubt', 'use ""dear""', 'account for uncertainties about your recipient', 'use informal salutations only in casual or intimate contexts']",How to Begin a Letter," Formal letters have somewhat long, detailed headers which contain both your own personal information and the information of the person you are contacting. Provide as much of this information as you are able to. The first thing you should do is to write your address (and/or your name) in the top left corner. Write the address in standard two-line form - in other words, put your street address in the very top left corner and your city, state, and postal code on the line below it.   If you choose to include your name, which is not required, put it in the very top left, rather than your address, which will then occupy the second and third lines. Here is a sample of how we might write our name and address:    John Smith 21 Jump Street Milwaukee, WI, 12345    ; , Next, write the current date. Skip a line below your address, then write the date so that it's similarly aligned with the left edge of the page.   Dates are written in the form: month, day, year. Always spell out the month of the date, but not the day or year. Here is a sample date of this form:  April 1st, 2014    , Finally, you must specify the name and address of the person you're attempting to contact. This is called the ""inside address"" because it's the same information as on the outside of the envelope, only inside it instead. Skip a line below the date and write this aligned with the left edge of the page as well. If you know the name of the person you're contacting, lead with this. If not, try to at least include his or her title (like, for instance, ""Professor of English Literature"" or ""Senior Technician""). If you know both, write the name first, then the title on the next line. If you're writing to this person at his or her place of employment, next, write the name of this place. Finally, write your recipient's address on the following lines.   Here is an example of an inside address:    Mrs. Jane Doe Director of Stadium Operations Wrigley Field 1060 West Addison Street Chicago, IL, 98765      , The instructions above aren't the sole way to compose a header in a formal letter. Other options are acceptable as well. The most common alternative to the method above is to position your return address in the top right corner, rather than the top left corner, and to position the date under the inside address, rather than above it. In other words, in this alternative configuration, the return address is in the top right corner, followed by a skipped line, followed by the inside address aligned with the left side of the page, followed by another skipped line, followed by the date., The above instructions assume you're writing a letter in a formal or business context. If you're simply writing a letter to a friend or casual acquaintance, you may want to skip the pretense of a formal header. If so, simply writing the date in the top left corner is sufficient. After this, you may proceed to the salutation and the body of the letter itself.  , The salutation is the greeting that begins a letter - ""Dear distinguished colleague,"", ""My true love,"", and so on. You have a variety of choices when it comes to salutations, each of which may be appropriate for certain occasions and not for others. Whichever salutation you choose, make sure you align it with the left edge of the paper and leave a blank line on either side of it (in other words, have blank lines between it, the header, and the body of the letter). Note that salutations almost always end with a comma.   In the US, in certain business contexts, a colon sometimes substitutes for the comma in a salutation. However, this is rare.  , If you ever have any doubts about which salutation to use, the standard ""Dear ,"" works wonders. This salutation is suitable for letters ranging from formal to casual and from grave to content. If you include a title, use only your recipient's last name. For instance, ""Dear Mr. Smith,"" is correct, while ""Dear Mr. John Smith,"" is somewhat unusual.   For example, we might begin our letter to Jane Doe with the simple ""Dear Mrs. Doe,"". If we want, we can include her title: ""Dear Director Doe,"".  , Sometimes, it's impossible to know exactly who will be receiving your letter, such as when you're writing to a department of a large institution. In these cases, it's important to make sure that your salutation takes your uncertainties into account so as not to make an unfair assumption about the recipient. Below are some common situations in which you'll need to account for unknowns:   If you're unsure of the gender of your recipient, use ""Dear Sir or Madam"", or simply use their full name (i.e., ""Dear Lee Anderson,"") If you don't know whether you're writing to a man or a woman, but you know your recipient's title, you may use it instead (like ""Dear Professor,"", ""Dear Senator,"", etc.). If you don't know a female recipient's marital status, use ""Ms."", rather than ""Mrs."", as in ""Dear Ms. Norton,"". Finally, if you are sending a letter to a business or institution rather than to a specific person within the business or institution, you may want to use ""To whom it may concern,"" rather than a traditional salutation. Some find this salutation undesirable- it is also acceptable to use ""Dear ,"" though this is somewhat informal.  , While you'll generally want to stick to ""Dear"" salutations in most formal and semi-formal contexts, if you're writing to a close friend, significant other, or family member, you can usually get away with informal salutations. Because you're no longer bound by rules of etiquette in these situations, you have a wide variety of options at your disposal. Below are just a few:   If you're writing to a good friend or a close family member, you may want to use a nickname or pet name in your salutation (""Dear Gator,"", ""Dear Fonz,"", etc.) If you're writing to a lover or significant other, you can be flowery and affectionate in your salutation, though you don't have to be. ""My true love,"" ""Dear Smooshums,"" and ""To my one and only angel,"" are just as valid as simpler romantic salutations, like simply writing your recipient's name, followed by a comma (i.e. ""John,"" or ""Jane,"")  ",1076,"['alternate header arrangement', 'doubt', 'use informal salutations', 'intimate contexts', 'name', 'top left corner', 'inside address', 'header', 'salutation', 'casual letters', 'uncertainties', 'date', 'line', 'contact information', 'return address']"
"['wash your hair', 'towel-dry your hair', 'comb out any tangles', 'apply some product', 'use a good hair dryer', 'rough dry your hair', 'divide your hair into sections', 'use the right kind of hairbrush', 'use the right technique to blow dry the hair straight', 'let down the next section of hair', 'apply some finishing product']",How to Straighten Your Hair2," This may seem like a no-brainer, but you will need to wash your hair before blow drying. Use a smoothing shampoo and conditioner if your hair is thick or prone to frizz, or go for volumizing if your hair is thin or flat.   Only apply conditioner to the ends and mid-lengths of your hair. If you apply it to the roots, you hair will look flat and greasy. Use a wide-toothed comb to work out any tangles while the conditioner is in your hair. The conditioner will make it much easier and will minimize hair breakage.  , Once you step out of the shower, wrap your hair in an absorbent, microfiber towel and leave it for a minute or two. Then unwrap your hair and use your towel to gently dab or blot your hair to get rid of any excess moisture.   Don't rub your hair with the towel, as this will cause your hair to break. Remember that you are not trying to dry your hair with the towel, it should still be pretty damp when you're finished towel drying.  , Use a wide-tooth comb or paddle brush to part and comb your hair. Make sure to be gentle because damp hair is very fragile. Remember to work from the ends upwards, rather than from the roots down, as this will cause less breakage.          Defining your part while your hair is still wet will help it stay more naturally after it’s been dried and straightened. If your hair is very knotted, try spraying it with a detangling mist or a leave-in conditioner.  , Apply a small amount of straightening serum or cream to the ends and mid-lengths of your hair and massage it in. This will help to make your hair extra smooth and sleek after drying.          If you can find a straightening product which contains a heat protection element, all the better. Again, avoid applying these products to the roots, as they will weigh hair down.  , A good hair dryer is essential when you are trying to blow dry your hair straight. The more power and heat a hair dryer can provide, the easier and faster you can straighten your hair. If you need to invest in a new hair dryer, there are several things you should consider:   Wattage. The wattage of a hair dryer is an indication of how powerful an air flow it has. The higher the wattage you can get, the better. Most salon hair dryers have a wattage of around 1800, though a wattage of 2000 may be necessary for very thick or curly hair.Speed and Temperature Controls. Having a hair dryer with adjustable speeds and temperatures is a major bonus, as you will use different settings to achieve different styles. For example, a cool setting can be used to finish your hair with a blast of cold air, which helps to set the style while adding shine.Weight. The last thing you want is a heavy hair dryer which is going to tire out your arm when you're just halfway through a blow dry. Look for a hair dryer which weighs less than two pounds. The weight should be indicated on the box.Attachments. If you are using a hair dryer to blow dry your hair straight, you will definitely need a nozzle attachment which concentrates the air flow and prevents hair from frizzing. Check to see if a nozzle attachment is included with your hair dryer or if it needs to be purchased separately., Turn your hair dryer on (to a high speed and heat, if possible) and begin roughly drying your hair. Concentrate on drying your roots, using your fingers to lift and separate your hair. You shouldn't use a brush just yet.         Make sure that the hair dryer is pointing downwards. It should be blowing hair down from the crown of your head, rather than upwards.You should continue rough drying your hair until it is about 60% to 80% dry, but no more., Dividing your hair into sections before you finish blow drying is a good idea, as it will help you to focus on straightening one layer of hair at a time. Split your hair into three layers - one at the crown of your head, one at the middle sections and one at the nape of your neck. Use butterfly clips or hair ties to keep the top two layers out of the way for now.          If you have bangs, leave them down and dry them first, before you dry the bottom layer. This is because bangs will dry quickly and they will be harder to straighten once dry.  , The type of hairbrush you use while blow drying your hair will have an impact on how your hair turns out. If you want to add volume while you straighten, or add a slight curl or flick to the ends, use a thick round brush. But if you want poker-straight locks, a paddle-brush is your best option., Take a section of hair between two and four inches wide and hold it taut with the hairbrush. Keeping the hair taut while drying is the most important technique in achieving straight hair.         You also need to make sure that you are directing the air flow downwards - the nozzle of the hair dryer should be pointing towards the ends of the hair as you dry. This keeps the hair cuticle down, giving you a smoother, sleeker result.Once you have completely dried each section of hair, finish it off with a blast of cool air to help set the style and add shine., Once you have completely dried the bottom layer of hair, remove the butterfly clip holding the middle layer. Dry this layer of hair using the same technique as before. Once the second layer is completely dry, let down the third and final layer and finish off your blow dry.          Once your hair is completely dry, it should look straight and sleek. If it's still a little wavy, you may need to dry it further, really using the brush to pull the hair straight. And if all else fails, use a straightening irons to go over any particularly stubborn bits.  , To set your style and give your hair a little extra shine and control, apply a pea-sized amount of finishing product to the ends and mid-lengths of your hair. A shine serum or a shine spray will both do the trick. If you're worried about your hair falling flat or losing its shape, mist it with a light layer of hairspray, holding the can about six inches away from your head. This will ensure that your hair stays straight all day (or night!) long.

This confrontation involved the European Axis Powers (mainly Germany and Italy) against the Soviet Union and other Allied Powers.The Eastern Front was where the majority of concentration camps were located and, thus, played a major role in the Holocaust. The major battles fought on the Eastern Front include Stalingrad and the battles that led to the recapture of Kharkov by the Soviets.; , The Western Front was the site of many conflicts between Germany and other Western European countries like Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.The first phase of the war in the Western Front involved many of these western countries fighting Germany in attempts that culminated with the Battle of Britain. The second phase saw a lot of ground combat between the two sides that began with the landing in Normandy and lasted until the German defeat in 1945. The major battles fought on the Western Front include the Normandy D-Day landing, the Battle of the Bulge, the Battle of Britain, and the Battle of Arnhem., After the Japanese attack on American’s military bases at Pearl Harbor, the US launched a counterstrike against the Japanese who had overextended their military forces, resulting in massive air battles that usually resulted in greater losses for the Japanese than for the American Allies.The major battles fought in the Pacific Theater included Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Midway, and the Battle of the Philippine Sea.  , The major players in World War II included the Axis and the Allied Powers. These were the entities between which most of the major battles took place.The Axis Powers included Germany, Italy, Japan, (and less significantly) Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Thailand, Finland, and Iraq. The Allied Powers included Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, (and less significantly) Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, and Yugoslavia.  , Books can be the most important source for gathering information. Primary sources are books that are written by someone with firsthand experience about the topic. So, in this case, primary sources about WWII would be written by people who actually participated in the war in some way (mostly memoirs and autobiographies).Keep in mind, though, the relative bias of sources because you’re usually just getting one person’s point of view. Some notable primary sources include:   Memoirs of the Eastern Front   A Writer at War by Vasily Grossman   Memoirs of the Western Front   The Second World War by Winston Churchill  To Hell and Back by Audie Murphy (America's most decorated WWII soldier)   Memoirs of the Pacific theater   Goodbye, Darkness by William Manchester  Isles of the Damned by R.V. Burgin    , Secondary sources are written by people who don’t have firsthand knowledge of the event, but who have done extensive research on the topic. Be aware these are interpretations by people who were not necessarily there. Some notable secondary sources include:   Eastern Front   Berlin by Anthony Beevor  Stalingrad by Anthony Beevor   Western Front   Armageddon by Max Hastings  Overlord by Max Hastings   Global   The Meaning of the Second World War by Ernest Mandel  The Origins of the Second World War by A.J.P. Taylor    , Many public libraries contain books and encyclopedia articles that can give you a broad overview of World War II or more specific information about individual events or aspects of the war.. There is a vast array of information available in a public library. You might even stumble upon something you didn’t know you were looking for.  , Watching films about WWII can be a great way to learn about what happened during this time in history. Just be careful to watch movies that are historically accurate and not simply sensationalizing the past for entertainment value.   Remember that few films are primary sources except for propaganda films.  , The Eastern Front was one of the most volatile areas of the entire WWII conflict. Nearly half of all of the casualties from the war took place on the Eastern Front.Some examples of historically accurate films about the Eastern Front include:    Cross of Iron (1977)  Stalingrad (1993)  Enemy at the Gates (2001) (Stalingrad)  Downfall (2004) (Berlin)  Defiance (2008)  Valkyrie (2008)  , The Western Front consisted mostly of air warfare between Germany and Britain as well as the infamous D-Day landing in Normandy.Some examples of historically accurate films about the Western Front include:    Das Boot (1981)  Saving Private Ryan (1998)  The Longest Day (1962) (Invasion of Normandy)  A Bridge Too Far (1977) (Operation Market Garden)  Band of Brothers (2001). This is a mini-series produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks that is based on Stephen E. Ambrose's book of the same name. The series follows Easy Company, a company of paratroopers in the 101st Airborne Division, 506 Parachute Infantry Regiment, from their training in Fort Bragg to the occupation of Germany, covering scenes such as Operation Overlord (commonly known as D-Day), Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and Easy company capturing Hitler’s Eagle Nest.  , The Pacific theater mainly involved the conflict between Japan and the United States during World War II. This includes the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Iwo Jima, and many other crucial events in the war.Some historically accurate films to watch about conflict in the Pacific include:    The Thin Red Line (Guadalcanal)  Flags of our Fathers (2006) (Iwo Jima)  Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)  The Pacific (2010). Like Band of Brothers, this is a miniseries produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. Unlike Band of Brothers, it details the stories of soldiers of the 1st Marine Division at Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa and is based on three separate books. It is also an extremely accurate depiction of World War II.  , Talk to a veteran and get their perspective on the war. Having a conversation with a veteran could be one of the best ways for you to get information about WWII because you can get actual firsthand recollections from someone who experienced it.If you have trouble finding a veteran to talk to, you might try attending your community’s Veteran’s Day parade. They often participate in such events. You can also ask older relatives what their experiences were like. While not everyone went to war, those who stayed home can give you insight into what the world was like at that time. And many of them contributed to the war effort at home.  , Many of the bigger museums pertaining to World War II are in Europe, but there are also quite a few in the United States. No matter which one you go to, there will be plenty of accurate information for you to learn about World War II. Here are some museums you might want to visit:   The National WWII Museum of New OrleansThe Museum of World War II in BostonThe Wright Museum of World War II in Wolfeboro, New HampshireThe WWII Japanese American Internment Museum in McGehee, ArkansasThe Imperial War Museum in LondonThe D-Day Museum in Portsmouth, EnglandThe Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima, JapanThe Bergen-Belsen Memorial in Germany, Many colleges give courses in the history department that focus exclusively on World War II. Look at the class catalogue for your college (or one in your area) and see if they offer something similar.This is a great way to learn about WWII, especially if you are not a very good self-motivator. If you take a course, you’ll have teacher-imposed deadlines to complete your learning.  , This is probably a step few will accomplish, but this is the best way to get a feel for what the war was like for the soldiers. Visiting the actual location of the D-Day invasion will help you visualize what happened on that day in history.   There are also monuments, cemeteries, and memorials for you to visit near D-Day site in Normandy., One of the best ways to fully understand the truly devastating implications of World War II is to visit the site of a former concentration camp. It will be a powerful and moving experience to visit the actual sites of such tragic events. These sites also contain memorials and museums with plenty of information about the events that took place during the war.Try visiting Auschwitz-Birkenau, Sachsenhausen, or Buchenwald.",1398,"['pacific theater', 'class', 'museum', 'normandy', 'secondary source books', 'western front', 'view films', 'war', 'wwii', 'primary source books', 'veteran', 'watch movies', 'watch films', 'former concentration camp', 'movies', 'major forces', 'eastern front', 'trip', 'public library', 'local college']"

Do other things; read books, play video games, see friends, focus on hobbies.; , A great show ending doesn't feel great, but the empty feeling can be alleviated by sharing your thoughts with others. Make a post outlining your opinions on the show wrap-up. Online posts can spark an engaging conversation about what you just saw. Sharing the loss with other people will make it feel better.  , If only so you have people to geek out over your favourite parts with, fellow fans are a great way to intensify your appreciation for parts of a show. A show's first-run comes with the social aspect of being able to discuss it the morning after an episode airs. The same should be true when the show ends.  , If you can't bear the thought of your favorite show ending, why not continue writing the show yourself? Pick up where the characters were in the final episode and start their story anew from there. If you're really passionate and knowledgeable about the show, you should have at least some idea of where the characters would go next.   If a show's fandom is big enough, it's quite likely that other writers have penned their own fanfictions about the show already. Go to sites like FanFiction and read some work about your favorite characters.Remember to give credit to the creator of a TV show or the author of a book.  , Sit around and discuss your favorite parts of the show. If footage is available, watch some of your favourite clips. Get into friendly debates over aspects of the series finale. A bit of friendly argument is a great way to get your mind off the loss.   If you want to get theatrical with your farewell, you can hold a mock funeral for the show and its characters.You can go around in a circle and reflect on your favourite characters and scenes.  , If a network cancelled a show and realizes there is significant following they've alienated, they may be convinced to bring the show back on air. Find out whoever cancelled or ended the show, and send a letter expressing your love for the show. If it was cancelled, make sure to emphasize that you would like to see the show returned to television. If a network gets enough feedback for one show, it almost certainly has an effect on whether they decide to bring it back or not.   Don't get your hopes up about a revival. Shows like Firefly received a zealous backlash when they were cancelled, but never got the TV revival fans were looking for.  , After some time, all of the seasons of your favourite show will be available for home purchase. The most conventional way of this is to buy the DVD box sets. Having a concrete copy of your favourite show at home is great if you watch the show a lot and don't want to rely on a channel for it. Streaming services like Netflix also showcase entire shows. This makes streaming services perfectly suited for the ""binge watching"" that usually comes with watching a great show.   Check online to see if your show is available as a free download. Some of the channel's websites will feature old episodes so people can catch up on their own time.  , You can watch a few episodes per night, or marathon entire seasons in a day if you want. As always, the most enjoyable way to do this is to do it in pairs or as a group. Watching a whole show together requires some common scheduling, but it will feel a lot less lonely.  , Special features show the behind-the-scenes stuff in a TV show. Things like interviews, on-set documentaries and marketing spots all help to enrich your knowledge and appreciation of the show. If you look at everything that went into the making of a particular scene, you'll almost certainly have a greater appreciation for it the next time you put it on.  , If you look up your favourite show on it, you can look for all of the listed plot devices that show used, and see how it ties in with the rest of pop culture. All of it can seem overwhelming at first to a newcomer, but the associations between your show and the rest of pop culture can be a ton of fun to research.  , This way, you'll be able to live vicariously through someone's fresh excitement over a show you've grown familiar with.  , After you watch a show for the second time, you should think about the ways your opinion has changed towards it. Watching a show a second time means you'll know what happens at the end even on the first episodes. This will frame character arcs and dialogue in a fresh new light, now that you know what the writers were leading up to.  , Sites like IMdB are perfectly suited for hunting down TV recommendations.There are lists of ""best ever"" TV shows you can use as a reference for finding new shows when you feel you're ready to move on. Recommendations are easy to find online. It shouldn't take long to find a few potential prospects that might be worth looking into for your next show.  , Each of the people who worked on your favourite shows have careers that kept going once that show ended. It is likely that each of those people (from the cast or crew) have worked on other shows. If you had a favourite actor, check to see what his or her other credits are. Loved the witty scripts in a show? Check to see what the screenwriter or show runner has been up to since your favourite show ended.  , Friends are a perfect source of recommendations. If you're not sure what you want to watch, it's a good idea to talk to them. See what they've been into lately. Ask if there's a show they think you might be into. Friends are a good source of eyes and ears when it comes to new media. There are way too many shows to look into yourself, so getting others to do the legwork for you will save you loads of time.   It goes without saying that it's preferable to ask friends who have cultural tastes you agree with or respect.  , These can be very helpful, as they'll give you recommendations that your friends might not have heard of before. Sites like TasteKid, IMdB or RateYourMusic will offer you their best guesses as to stuff you might be into, based on the ratings and interests you input in their system.  , Once you start a show, there's nothing forcing you to keep up with it. Watch the pilot episode of a few shows. Give them each a fair chance, and move on if you're not finding it grabs you. You may have to go through a few shows before you find one that seems like it'll be truly worth your time.   Keep the time investment of a new show in mind. Shows take dozens of hours out of your life. That is valuable time that should only be invested if the show is something that really inspires you.  , When all is said, it may eventually come time to jump ship and join a new fandom with a show that's still happening.

However, the sale of an automobile must be in writing in order to be enforceable., If you are the seller of the car, you are the one responsible for the language in the contract. If there are any terms in the contract that wind up being ambiguous, they will usually be ruled in favor of the buyer.If you want to have the right to repossess the car in case of a default, make sure that your contract defines the following issues:   Default – just what is a “default”? Do you want the right to repossess if the buyer is a day late with his or her payment? A week late? A month late? Be sure to specify.Notice – If the buyer is late, will you issue a warning or notice of default before repossessing? In some states, you may have to, but in others you may not. Spell it out in the contract.Grace Period – Will you allow a grace period for late payments? Many contracts will accept payments that are made within, for example, five to ten days late, but many do not. This is a point you need to discuss when signing the contract and make sure to include it in writing.  , In this case, the collateral is the car itself. Part of your sale contract needs to include language that creates a security interest in the car.  , Your contract needs to put the buyer on notice that failure to pay on time may lead to repossession. You will need to check with your state law to be sure that you use the proper language about creating a security interest, which is what gives you the right to repossess the property., If this was a private sale to a friend or neighbor, then locating the vehicle may not be a difficult process. On the other hand, it may take some work to hunt it down. When you do believe that you have found the vehicle, be absolutely certain that you have the actual car. Check the car’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). You can usually find this on the dashboard, in the front left corner under the windshield. Check and make sure that it exactly matches the number on your title or contract for the sale.  , When you go to take possession of the car, you will need to have the proof that you are entitled to it. This would include the original contract, the proof of payments that you have received and, by the absence, the ones you have not received. If you need the help of a police officer or a locksmith, for example, they will most certainly require this information.  , You have a few choices when it comes to gaining entry into a car and removing it from the premises.   Use the key code to have a key made in advance. Many cars manufactured within the last six years have a key code that can be found on the title or by looking up the car’s VIN. You can use this key code to have a key made for you.Pick the car lock to get in. Slide a narrow metal rod through the window and into the door, then use it to pull up the door lock. You may also use a wire coat hanger bent to the correct shape. Tow the vehicle. You may opt to hire a towing company or tow the car yourself. Start the vehicle without a key. Use this method if you must gain entry into the car without having a key. There are other sources online with information about “hot wiring” a car.  , Once you have taken possession, remove the car to a secure location where you can hold it until you resolve the issue of payment or sale. Be aware that once the car is in your possession, you become responsible for its condition. If the car gets damaged through your negligence, the debtor may actually have a legal claim against you for any loss in the car's value.  , Nearly every state has a law that allows you to repossess a car as described here. Those laws also require that you are not allowed to “breach the peace” to take the car.A “breach of peace” generally means that you may not:   Break into someone’s house to get the keys, or into their locked garage to take the car. (There is some question about taking the car from a closed, but unlocked garage.)Cause a fight or other physical altercation while taking the car. For example, if the owner/debtor notices what you are doing and tries to stop you, perhaps by standing in your way or blocking the car, you may not forcibly remove him in order to take the car.Cause damage to the car or other property while in the act of repossessing the car.  , You may have the right to repossess the car, but that does not give you the right to any additional property that is inside the car. For example, if the owner/debtor has expensive camera equipment in the back seat, you are responsible for returning that to him or at least notifying him how and when he can collect it. Otherwise, he could turn around and sue you for the value of that additional property., To “redeem” means to pay off the amount that is owed and buy back the car. Most states allow the debtor this right., The purpose of repossessing a car is usually to re-sell it in order to collect the money that is owed on the loan. As the lender, you are required to conduct this sale in a “commercially reasonable” manner. This means that you must advertise it fairly and conduct it at a place and time that is reasonable expected to bring a fair price.You may not, for example, tell two of your friends that you will be holding an auction at 2:00 a.m. on Tuesday and consider that “commercially reasonable.” It is up to you to sell the car for a fair price.  , If you repossess a car, you are generally entitled to recover not only the full unpaid loan amount but also any costs of the repossession, advertisement of a sale, costs of hiring an auctioneer, etc. You must keep accurate records of all these costs and be able to show them if the debtor questions your figures., If you are able to sell the car for an amount that is greater than the loan and the costs you incurred, you are required to return any remaining money to the debtor. You are only allowed to collect what you are actually owed – not more., If the debtor notifies you at any point in this process that he has filed bankruptcy, then your efforts to repossess the car must stop immediately.   If you have not yet taken possession of the car, then do not go through with the repossession. If you have already taken possession of the car but have not yet sold it, then you should keep it secure until you are contacted by a representative of the Bankruptcy Court with further instructions. If you have advertised a sale but have not held it yet, you should stop and check with the bankruptcy trustee to find out if you may proceed with the sale. Any action you take after being notified of a bankruptcy case could be considered a violation of federal law on your part and could create serious problems for you.",1278,"['borrower', 'possession', 'loan', 'clear contract language', 'vehicle', 'repossession', 'accurate records', 'contract', 'collateral', 'sale', 'bankruptcy', 'security interest', 'property', 'return excess value', 'breach', 'right', 'car', 'peace', 'clear provision', 'paperwork']"

If he slouches his shoulders when near you, he's romantic and cares about what you have to say. If he points his shoulders and pelvis towards you while sitting, he is definitely feeling something for you.; , If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.  , If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.  , If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.  , He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, unless he's a bit of a ""playboy"" who flirts with a lot of girls. See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else.  , Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction, and helps them know if you really do like them or not. You can tell that they are trying to make you jealous if they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend to look out for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you.  , For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you introduce him to a TV show that he didn't really know about and that becomes his new favorite thing, that's a sign that he likes you.  , Signs of nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, or possibly even looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he likes.  , If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't?  , smiles at you a lot in the hallway, work, etc., at least go out for a walk.)  , If he mimics you, he probably likes you, such as if you move to another table, he'll go with you.  , If a guy teases you a lot, it might mean he likes you, but if he doesn't tease any other girl, he probably does like you.  , A guy may hit you but it's just flirting he probably just wants to see your smile You may find it annoying if you're not into him, but otherwise if you hit back then that's a way then he can know that you like him back!  , If you do your hair or makeup differently one day, and the guy notices, that's a very good sign that he likes you. Most guys won't notice, and if they do, they won't say anything unless they're into you. Anything like, ""You look nice today,"" ""I like that shirt,"" or even ""Did you do your hair differently today? It looks nice,"" are all indicators that he could be interested in you. NOTE: If he's a good friend of yours, these won't necessarily be indicators of romantic interest. It could just be him being a good friend. Not all guys are this straightforward about compliments, so don't be worried if he doesn't compliment you.  , For example, some of your dad's aftershave rubbed off on you when you hugged him. Your crush may say 'is that aftershave on you?' This indicates he thinks it is from another guy (and not your dad!)  , If he chats with you often he may like you. He could also just be talkative and friendly so don't assume he's into you for chatting. He may put 'x' on the end of everything he says to you. That might not necessarily mean he likes you. It could just mean that you are good friends. If he says, ""I know something you don't know,"" then this could mean that he likes you and wants you to be guessing. He might also want you to know and wants to see if you feel the same way. Or it could just mean he knows something you don't know, e.g. a new colour, the fact that he has a new friend, etc.  , For example, if you're on table 1, talking to your friends, watch to see if he is close nearby. So when the conversation end, and you go to say, table 7, see if he follows you, but of course does not follow you to table 7 unless he is good friends with the people at table 7 and wants to talk to them coincidentally. Check to see if he stands at a different place when you are at table 1 and 7 to make sure he is following you.

"['learn to look beyond the marketing claims accompanying pet food', 'locate the ""guaranteed analysis"" on the pet food label', ""be aware that percentages alone don't tell the whole story"", 'be mindful that pet food manufacturers can manipulate this information', 'some pet owners search for pet foods that use human grade ingredients with no animal by-products and avoid pet foods that use artificial colors', 'flavors', 'sugars and chemical preservatives (notably bha and bht)', 'do a cost per weight analysis to determine the weight value of the pet food product', 'check the label for ""nutritional adequacy""', 'read the feeding instructions', 'be savvy about marketing claims such as natural', 'organic', 'premium', 'etc']",How to Read a Pet Food Label," In the USA, pet food labeling is regulated on a federal (FDA) and state-by-state basis, with guidance from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). However, AAFCO provides only minimum requirements. The reality is that pet food producers often use terms that are undefined by the regulations, in order to communicate more effectively with consumers and improve their product's image in the market.  The AAFCO warns on their website that ""it is not rare at all that labeling and marketing information is designed to appeal to the latest trend in marketing human products."" In other words, the focus tends to be more on appealing to our preferences than on whether or not the food is suitable for your pet. For this reason, learn to look behind the marketing hype and to find the real substance of the nutrition status within the pet food.        It is important to always check the ingredient list because a named food is not always necessarily the primary ingredient.; , See the example under ""Tips"" below. Note that the percentages given for protein, fat, and fiber are measurements of the food in its current state. However, because different pet foods have different levels of moisture, you can only logically compare pet foods on a dry matter basis. Moisture levels in pet foods can range from approximately 6 percent to as much as 80 percent.  Canned food obviously contains more moisture than dry kibble. But it may not necessarily contain as much protein, for example. You can't tell which food contains the most protein, fat or fiber until you have converted both labels to a dry matter basis.       Determine the amount of dry matter first, by subtracting the percentage given for moisture from 100 percent. Using the example below, the moisture accounts for 10 percent of the pet food. Therefore, the dry matter content is (100% - 10% = ) 90% of the pet food. Convert the protein, fat and fiber percentages to a dry matter basis by dividing the percentages given on the label by the amount of dry matter (from the previous step). In our example, the 26 percent protein on the label converts to 28 percent on a dry matter basis by dividing 26% by 90%. (Notice that in this example the dry matter calculation is only slightly different than the labeled percentage. This is because the moisture level was only 10 percent per the label. If the moisture level had been, say, 40 percent, then the dry matter content would have only been 60 percent and protein on a dry matter basis would have been calculated as (26% divided by 60% =) 43%.) Compare the new protein level of 28 percent on a dry matter basis to other pet foods (once you've converted the other pet food labels in the same way). Do similar comparisons for fat and fiber after converting to a dry matter basis calculation.  , You may have 28 percent protein on a dry matter basis, but what is the source of that protein? You can get protein from chicken beaks and feet that are not good sources of nutrition for your pet! This means that you'll need to look next at the list of ingredients. Pet foods must list ingredients in order of weight.  Generally, the first five ingredients will make up the majority of the pet food product. Ideally, look for meat as one of the first ingredients on a pet food label. Grains, such as corn, cornmeal, whole wheat, barley, rice are used to provide essential energy for the pet and appealing texture to the kibble.       Even the AAFCO website admits that ""Economics plays a part in any ingredient selection"" and ""protein is not simply protein. Ingredients providing protein have specific amino acids which may or may not match the amino acid profile required by a cat or a dog."" Manufacturers routinely combine multiple protein sources to provide for all the amino acids required for a healthy life.  , For example, by breaking an ingredient down into components and then listing them individually so that you don't notice an easily recognized undesirable ingredient too near the top of the list, this information can be effectively changed enough to cause you to read the label differently.  , However, some animal by-products like liver and other internal organs are excellent sources of the amino acids and other nutrients that dogs and cats need. In addition, dry pet foods need preservatives to prevent spoilage and degradation of essential nutrients.   Contact the manufacturer direct to find out what the ""by-products"" listed in their product actually consist of. Be aware that this may change without warning. Sometimes your pet's reaction will be enough to make this obvious!  , The density of dry products can be changed through puffing up the food, while different wet foods can be labeled with pounds or ounces (or other measurements), making weight comparison harder. Check the price comparison to get the real value.  , This is one of the most important aspects of a pet food label because it can impact a pet's health if claims are made about being nutritionally complete when the product is not able to meet all nutrient requirements for your pet. To be reassured on this count, look for:   The words: ""(Name of product) is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO (Dog/Cat) Food Nutrient Profiles."" Or look for the words: ""Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that (name of product) provides complete and balanced nutrition."" Be sure to choose the right life cycle stage for your pet - this should be on the label too (for example, kitten/puppy). Pet food needed for pets that are growing, reproducing or working hard should be chosen with care that it can meet all the nutrient requirements for that pet. Size, breed or senior labeling claims must meet the criteria for adequate adult pet nutritional needs; in reality, the more precise claims are harder to ascertain.  , Even if you think you know how to feed your pet the particular product, changes do happen or you might have transposed feeding instructions from one product to a new one. Always read these with care to ensure that you are feeding your pet adequately. However, even though manufacturers try to cover all contingencies, you still need to monitor your own pet's needs, preferences and environmental conditions. Talk to your vet if you're unsure, especially with respect to growing and reproducing pets.And don't forget to visit the vet every month or so to be sure..   As part of feeding, also read the calories provided by the product. The amount of calories provided can vary considerably between products and between dry and wet foods. If your pet is growing, overweight or underweight, or has an illness, calories are of especial interest. Calorie statements are made on a ""kilocalories per kilogram"" basis. Kilocalories are the same as the ""Calories"", while a ""kilogram"" is a unit of metric measurement equal to 2.2 pounds. It may also be stated as ""per cup"" or ""per can"", alongside the required kilocalories per kilogram statement.  , These are marketing words without official definitions to back them up. While it is surely to be hoped that all pet food is ""natural"", this usually refers to a lack of artificial additives, colors or flavors. The words ""premium"" and ""gourmet"" and the like are marketing speak and don't mean anything more than what the overall packaging suggests to the consumer. Organic pet food should be free of synthetic additives but guidelines are still under development for the official meanings.

Others choose to keep money there to protect their own privacy or to safeguard their money's value from fluctuations in the value of their home country's currency. Banks in the Bahamas offer all of these benefits in a country that has a stable economy and political system, as the Bahamas are part of the British Commonwealth.   Financial services account for a large part of the Bahamas' GDP. This makes the government inclined to protect laws that favor this industry and, by extension, account holders.; , Before opening a Bahamas account, you should consider how much you really need this type of account. Bahamas savings accounts may offer higher interest rates than American ones or those in other countries, but investment accounts offer similar returns. In addition, unless you are currently experiencing political or economic turmoil in your home country, these accounts are no safer than those closer to home.   That said, an offshore account can a step towards making yourself independent of your home country (if you are planning on moving) or a useful step to take when moving to the Bahamas. In addition, you can keep up to $10,000 in an offshore account without reporting it (though you still have to report earnings on the account)., The Bahamas is slowly becoming compliant with the US tax system. For now, they rely on a sort of honor system, where your foreign holdings and earnings will not be reported to the IRS (or the tax authority in your home country). However, you are still responsible for reporting assets (over $10,000) and any earnings in foreign account to IRS when you file your taxes.Foreign accounts, if you have over $10,000 in all of them combined, must be reported on an FBAR (FinCEN Form 114) if you live in the United States.Your earnings on foreign accounts will be taxes as either income or capital gains (depending on the nature of the account). Failing to report foreign assets or earnings constitutes tax evasion.  , While Bahamas accounts offer a number of benefits, you may find that your money will be more easily accessed or have more earning potential elsewhere. Alternately, you may want to diversify your accounts even further and open accounts in several different countries. Many countries across the World offer bank accounts to US citizens without much trouble, including:   Switzerland. Swiss bank accounts are perhaps the most famous type of offshore account. They offer legendary privacy and world-leading service. Other Caribbean islands. The Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Turks and Caicos all have thriving financial industries. Mongolia. A fast-growing economy, Mongolia offers impressive interest rates that may be up to as high as 13 percent. Hong-Kong. Some multinational banks (like HSBC) offer accounts in Hong-Kong, giving foreigners access to investment opportunities in China. In addition, accounts here are cheap and generally come with quick service., The bank you choose will depend on your financial goals. There are many private banks that offer investment accounts to foreigners without their being in the country. These accounts will have large minimum deposits, likely in the tens or hundreds of thousands dollars, and will seek to offer larger returns to foreign investors. However, if you are moving to the Bahamas or doing business there, you will need a local checking account. These will offer you easy access to your money and a debit card to facilitate transactions., After determining your needs you can begin to locate banks that have a presence in the Bahamas and can accommodate you. This is simple if you already have an account with a large multinational bank, as you may be able to open your account in advance from a branch in your area. Large banks active in the Bahamas include HSBC, Barclays, Citibank, and Scotiabank.   The largest local bank is First Caribbean International Bank. This bank and other local banks are eager to offer accounts to foreigners.Private bank accounts can be opened with a number of private banks. Some Swiss banks also have a presence in the Bahamas, including UBS and Credit Suisse. Other private banks operating in the Bahamas include Ansbacher, Corner Bank Overseas, Finter Bank & Trust, and Guaranty Trust Bank., Each bank will have a slightly different procedure and set of documentation requirements, so contact the banks first so that you can be provided this information. Ask about whether you have to be present to open an account and, if not, how you can open one remotely. In addition, ask about any account specifics, such as minimum deposit amounts and fees (annual fees, transaction fees, or others).For example, if you planned to live in the Bahamas, you would want an account that offered reduced ATM fees and free local transactions. Gather information from more than one bank so that you can compare them.  , Eliminate any banks that seem unprofessional to you when you contact them. Then, cut out any that you can't afford because of high minimum deposits or fees. Finally, compare the services and reputations of the remaining banks to make your choice. When you've decided, you're ready to begin the process of opening the account.  , There are certain documents that will likely be required when opening your account. These are largely for identification and should not be hard for you to get a hold of. In general, you will need the following:   Government-issued identification, like a passport or driver's license. Proof of residence, like a utility bill or some other document showing your home address. Other documents as required by the bank., For many types of accounts, you will be able to open them without actually visiting the Bahamas. The bank should have clarified this with you when you contacted them about the account. Either work through a branch office for the bank if you've chosen international bank, or communicate directly with the bank to set up the account. In some cases, you can also work with a law firm or financial advisor in your country and they will open the account for you and take care of the paperwork.Opening an account through a representative (like a law firm or financial advisor) is only advised if you plan on opening a private bank account or setting up a business structure in the Bahamas. Otherwise, taking this route may be cost-prohibitive.  , If you have to open the account in person or choose to do so, you will have to set up a meeting with a banker either by calling ahead or by simply walking into the bank. Be sure to bring all of the documents that you need to open the account so that you don't have to come back. Most bankers will request your documents and the following basic information:   Your legal name. Date of birth. Address. Citizenship and country of residency. Your occupation., In some cases, you may be asked to provide additional information or documents to the bank. You may need notarized copies of some documents you have already submitted. Alternately, you might be asked to provide six months or a year's worth of bank statements to prove your good standing with your old bank.   In other cases, you may be asked to provide a document proving the source of the money you are depositing. This is a measure intended to prevent the bank from taking on money obtained through illegal means. For example, if your money were obtained through the sale of property, you would need to provide a sales contract for that transaction., For some accounts, you are able to choose the currency in which your account balance will be held. For example, if you wanted to hold an account balance in US Dollars or Swiss Francs, rather than in your home currency, you could specify this. Doing so can protect you from fluctuations in the value of your home currency. However, keep in mind that there may be fees for converting your money to this currency, for example when you deposited and withdrew your money.   Check with your bank to ask about this option and inquire about fees for converting your money., After you've provided all of the required information and documents, you only need your initial deposit to finish opening your account. If you are opening the account through the mail or an intermediary, the deposit can be wire transferred from another bank or submitted as a check. You may also use cash if you are opening your account in person.",1423,"['currency', 'several banks', 'initial deposit', 'tax requirements', 'banker', 'benefits', 'needs', 'banks', 'bank', 'information', 'bahamas bank account', 'need', 'nations', 'account', 'accounts', 'documents', 'type']"

Consider deleting photos that depict any of the following activities:Drug or alcohol use or photos of you under the influence Sexual behavior Nudity Use of any gang signs or lewd hand gestures  , If you did not personally post the picture, you may need to request removal either from the social media site or from the person who posted it. You can untag these photos so that they don’t show up on your personal pages, but be aware that these images will still be online unless you get them removed., Though this might take some time, go through and review any negative statuses, tweets, or blog posts you may have put out. Delete anything related to sex or drugs or anything you may have posted that could be construed as racist, sexist, or homophobic.Exert extreme caution when posting anything in the future.  , Though employers will not likely care how many friends you have on facebook, you may notice that some on your friends list tag you in inappropriate or spammy posts.

Consider using only your first and middle name and not your last name for your social media sites if you are looking to keep a low profile., Just as important as it is to remove any negative things from your social media, it is imperative to replace it with positive posts. Share articles that are factual, interesting, and non-inflammatory. Share positive posts about your life, family, and job.

You can use your professional headshot or a picture of you doing something positive like volunteering or spending time with family.Make sure that your eyes are open, as well.  , You can also like and follow other pages to further rebrand yourself. Follow people whose work aligns with your interests. Share any articles or posts that interest you from these pages. Unfollow any pages that are lewd or obscene in any way., If you are looking to start a business or are recovering from a particularly damaging scandal, you may want to hire an image consultant to help you clean up your online footprint. This person will be able to instruct how and when to post certain information. They will also be able to assist you in deleting or spinning any negative information about you., Finally, as you are entering into this new, cleaner social media presence that you have created, strive to maintain it. Before you post anything, ask yourself the following questions:  Is this true? Is this positive? How would I think of someone else if they posted this? Will it bring joy to others?

This can lead to feelings of lightheadedness or chest tightness. Deep breathing is an effective and quick way to take control of your symptoms. Focusing on deep breathing can make your body experience an immediate sense of calm.You can use deep breathing when you begin to feel anxious or experience fear around a panic attack. Block any thoughts you have and instead, put your attention on your breath. Begin lengthening your breaths and breathing more slowly.; , Pick up a new activity that can help you relax and wind down. This can help you take a few steps back and help you to clear your head and calm your thoughts.Take a daily class or set aside time each day for specific activities.

Learn more about binaural beats by checking out How to Meditate With Binaural Beats MP3s.  , One of the major ways to treat panic disorder involves attending therapy. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is often the approach of choice, as it teaches you to notice and respond to your thoughts and behaviors. A therapist will help you examine the thoughts and behaviors that lead up to panic attacks and those which sustain or prolong the attacks. Together, you can work on changing the inner dialog to reduce and eliminate the attacks.Often, the fear of having another attack keeps people from living a full life. For example, if you fear having an attack at work, a therapist may ask you, “What’s the worst that could happen? You may need to excuse yourself for a few moments and come back when you feel more composed.”  , Some people are fearful of the possibility of a panic attack. For example, you may be more afraid of the thought of having a panic attack while speaking in front of a group and not being able to get help than actually fearing speaking in public. Exposure therapy can work with helping you to control your physical symptoms (such as elevated heart rate, sweating, and shallow breathing) in a safe and supportive setting. Working with a therapist, you will gradually begin to control these responses and not let them get out of control and turn into a panic attack.Exposure therapy should be performed by a qualified therapist and not on your own.  , Biofeedback therapy is a natural way to stop the cycle of anxiety. This therapy includes monitoring the physical signs of your anxiety, which may include changes in brain wave activity, heart rate, temperature, and breathing.In your therapy sessions, you will take on small challenges to practice bringing your anxiety under control, such as by using deep breathing and other relaxation techniques. Through these sessions, you will learn how to identify the signs of your anxiety and how to manage them effectively without the use of drugs.  , While panic disorder is often a psychological diagnosis, sometimes medical causes can mimic symptoms of panic attacks. It’s important to take any medical causes seriously. Ask your medical doctor about medical problems that may be the cause of the symptoms.Some medical causes that can look like panic symptoms include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), and minor problems related to the heart, such as mitral valve prolapse. Stimulants (such as amphetamines, cocaine, and caffeine) can also cause panic symptoms.  , Expanding your knowledge about panic disorder can help you lower your distress and is one way to support yourself. Learn about anxiety, panic disorder, and panic symptoms. It can be helpful to recognize typical symptoms of panic disorder and realize that you’re not “crazy.”Learn about the sensations, thoughts, and feelings that contribute to panic disorder. Many people experience the “fight-or-flight” response that your body creates to deal with potential danger. Recognize that this is a good response to danger, but can also be triggered in non-threatening situations and can contribute to panic disorder.  , If you feel alone in your experience or that having panic disorder is something you can’t talk about with those close to you, a support group can be of great benefit. You can meet with people who also experience panic disorder and not feel isolated or alone. A support group can provide information, mental health referrals, and advice about how to manage panic disorder.The support often doesn’t just occur within meetings. Some support groups offer telephone or email support, or use a buddy system to pair people together in support.  , Don’t be afraid to reach out to friends and family. If you feel overwhelmed, call up a friend or family member.You may feel embarrassed or scared to tell people about problems with your mental or emotional health. Remember that these are people who care about you and want to see you happy.   Your friends and family members want to support you.  , Exercise is an excellent way to control anxiety naturally.If you are prone to anxiety, then try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day, such as walking, biking, swimming, or taking an aerobics class.   You may also benefit from adding more activity during your regular activities, such as walking or riding your bike to work, parking further away from entrances at stores, and taking the stairs instead of the elevator.  , If you experience anxiety and panic symptoms, it’s best to stay away from substances that can provoke symptoms.Avoid tobacco, coffee, and caffeinated beverages. Avoid stimulants as well, which can be a part of diet pills or cold medicines.   Because many symptoms from panic attacks are bodily symptoms, take care of your body and treat it well.  , Eat and prepare healthy meals that support your overall health. Foods can affect your mood and emotions, so make sure you get your vitamins and nutrients to balance your mood and healthy functioning.Avoid skipping meals and have snacks on hand when you need them.You may want to keep some nuts or dried fruit in your car if you get hungry while driving.  , Get plenty of sleep each night. Most adults need 7 ½ to 9 hours of sleep each night, and children need up to 13 or 14 hours each night of sleep, depending on age.Especially if you are stressed, your body needs more sleep.For more information about building good sleep habits, check out How to Sleep Better.  , Some people use a supplement called inositol. Inositol influences serotonin, which can help with the frequency and severity of panic attacks. Like all supplements, consult with your physician prior to use.

A good question typically is an open-ended question that a person can respond to in a variety of ways. Questions can also provide clarification for something that is unclear. Asking questions shows that you are interested in furthering a discussion.Some good open-ended questions at work include, “What can we do to improve?” and, “What changes would you like to see?” If you want to ask personal questions, ask, “What activities do you enjoy?” and, “What was it like when you hiked the trail?”; , If you have something to say, say it. Don’t guess about how people will react or question if what you have to say is valuable. If you have a want or a need, make sure you can express it in a meaningful way. If you’re trying to express it in a subtle way and it’s not received, you need to be more overt, even if it feels uncomfortable. Recognize that your opinions, thoughts, and feelings are worthwhile and can be shared.For example, if you’re talking to a very chatty person, say, “I’d like to say something now.” If you’re in a meeting, say, “I have something to contribute to our discussion.” Being assertive also means knowing when to say “No.” If someone asks you to do something you just don’t have time for, don’t feel obligated to oblige. Say, “I can’t fit that in today, I’m sorry.”  , If you know someone who you consider to have great people skills, ask them for advice. Ask for ways to improve how you interact with other people. You can also look to them for what they do right in social situations. Notice what characteristics you admire about them, then try to replicate them in your own social interactions.   Observe how they treat people, the way they listen or validate others. You can also pay attention to how they speak and use their voice and words to make people feel comfortable. For example, they may appear open and jovial when they introduce themselves to new people. Take on a similar persona and see how people respond to you.  , Learn how to make friends easily. Put yourself in situations where you can meet lots of people and build friendships. Join groups, clubs, and sports teams. Attend activities at your school or workplace intended to foster relationships like lunches or conferences. These will give you opportunities to meet other people and instantly give you something to talk about in having a shared experience. Continue to talk once the activity ends by exchanging phone numbers or email addresses.Do activities that put you in contact with others, like taking your dog to the dog park. Invite people to spend time with you. For example, say, “Would you like to go to lunch?” You can also invite people to the movies or other activities. This shows you want to spend time with them.  , Conflicts are inevitable, yet the way you handle them can show people a lot about you. Aim to resolve conflicts peacefully, especially in the workplace. If you sense that something may become a conflict, resolve it quickly without causing offense. Don’t avoid the conflict and instead, seek to resolve it collaboratively. Listen and respond to the person, even when you disagree. Then, seek to create a mutually agreeable solution.Show people that you can handle conflicts maturely by listening, not raising your voice, and wanting to find solutions.  , If you’re nervous or stressed, manage these emotions. Take a moment to collect your thoughts or take a few deep breaths. Do things that help you feel calm. If you need a moment to think, ask for a question to be repeated or ask for clarification.Go into a situation feeling relaxed, not nervous. Do some calming exercises like meditation or yoga beforehand.  , Eye contact is a great way to connect with other people. It signifies who you are speaking to and shows the other person you are listening when they are speaking. However, don’t stare somebody down. It’s appropriate to make eye contact and look away occasionally.Try to keep your eye contact the same as the person you are speaking to. For example, someone who shies away from eye contact may feel uncomfortable if you make constant eye contact with them.  , People may be able to get an idea of who you are and what you’re about to do even before you open your mouth. This is because even the way you sit or stand is communicating something to other people. When you work on your body language, consider things like posture, gaze, gestures, and body position. For example, if your arms and legs are crossed, people might assume you are closed off or not engaged.When interacting with people, lean in when they speak to show you are listening. Turn your body toward them and communicate openness by keeping your body open. The phrase “Fake it ‘til you make it” rings true for body language. If you’re feeling nervous before an interview or a date, use your body to display confidence. Keep your head up and shoulders back., People appreciate it when they feel understood and enjoy when other people are listening to them. Show your listening skills by showing interest in what the person is saying. Avoid interrupting them and wait until they have finished speaking to say something.Focus your attention on really listening when the other person speaks. Don't try to think of what you will say in response. Favor your right ear when someone is talking. The right ear is connected to the left side of the brain, which can help to discriminate emotional and social nuances.  , Many people are concerned about what they’re going to say or how they will say it. Instead of putting the focus on yourself during the conversation, show an interest in the person you are talking to. Nod your head, smile, and make appropriate facial expressions to what they’re saying.One way to do this is by reflecting what they say to convey understanding. For example, you can say, “I hear you saying that you’re frustrated with what’s expected of you.”  , Listen for the unsaid things going on in interactions. For example, most people notice when a meeting feels tense, even if nobody is raising their voice. Learn to hone your observational skills and gain clues as to how other people are feeling. Notice if someone is feeling left out, then include them in a discussion. If someone looks nervous, help them feel calm and at ease.When you tune in to how another person feels, you can better respond to them. The other person may also feel validated and know that you care.  , Maybe your boss pulls you aside or an attractive person comes up to flirt with you. If a conversation comes up that you’re not prepared for, be calm. Let the conversation unfold naturally and don’t think too much about what to say.If you’re caught off guard, say so. For example, say, “I wasn’t prepared for this meeting so I don’t have that information with me right now. I’d be happy to get it for you within the hour.”  , If you make a social blunder, learn from it. Perhaps you spoke too loudly or interrupted someone in the middle of something important. To improve your social skills, learn from your mistakes and don’t repeat them. If you have a bad interaction with someone, come up with solutions to improve it for next time. For example, if you lost your temper, find ways to stay calm (like deep breathing) when you speak to them.   If you feel embarrassed by a mistake you made, remember that it will likely be forgotten. The important thing is to not make it again.  , Especially if things are becoming tense, crack a joke or say something funny to ease the tension. Humor is a great way to make people feel comfortable if others are feeling nervous or tense. Whether you’re meeting somebody for the first time or are in the midst of an intense meeting, humor can help.Say a joke or comment on something that’s relevant yet humorous. People will begin to feel comfortable around you because you tend to lighten the mood.  , Greet people with friendly, “Hello!” and stop to chitchat with people you see regularly. This is especially useful at a workplace or office. Even if you are not friends with people, show them that you are friendly and warm. If you have nothing to say, give a compliment or make small talk about the weather or television shows.Even if you don’t like someone, it doesn’t hurt to say a friendly, “Hello” or, “How are you doing?”  , Be the person people want to work with when joined on a team. Be able to explain your ideas and express your feelings in a way that others won’t feel threatened. Show respect for other people and their ideas, even if you disagree with them. Make sure that all people feel included and valued in the work.Show good leadership, yet don’t dominate the group. Make sure everyone has a place and can participate in the process.

You'll have more fun and create a more meaningful scrapbook if you choose a theme that's important to you.Some popular themes for scrapbooks include: family vacations, holidays, graduations, births, weddings, friends, or school.; , Collecting materials for a scrapbook may include many things, from photographs to newspaper clippings from a certain date. If you're looking for an older specific date, it may take you longer to find photographs or materials to use. While you can easily find material online, try looking for personal materials.   Ask family members for photographs, family trees, or souvenirs that they've collected over time.  , If you're collecting materials for a scrapbook, take time to think about the memory itself. These thoughts should be written down as they happen. If you think of something pithy or engaging, you may be able to use it as part of the text in your final product.   Talk to family members or friends involved in the memory to gather their memories or thoughts. You can also use these for the scrapbook.  , A scrap page won't offer a lot of space, so it's important to choose a theme for each page and follow the concept. This will keep the layout from looking unorganized or overwhelming.   For example, you could designate one page for a relationship you had with a specific friend or a special day you celebrated.  , A good scrapbook will consist of several different layers to give texture to each page. Gluing sheets of construction paper on top of one another will create a three-dimensional impression. Make the layers progressively smaller as you stack them to create an image that really stands out.You may need to measure out the pieces of paper so that you can fit multiple shapes and layers on your scrapbook pages.  , Try to use some basic color theory to support each scrapbook page. Colors can make you feel an immediate emotional response so decide what tone you want to convey for each page. For example, warm colors (like reds, yellows, and oranges) are energizing. You may want to use these colors for a sports or athletic scrapbook page.Cool colors (like blues, greens, and purples) are calming. These would be good colors to use for baby scrapbooks or relaxing vacations. Neutral colors (like browns and grays) are considered safe to use in most any situation.  , Whether or not you're using a standard printer page or a full-blown poster sheet, you only have a given amount of space to say what you want. With this in mind, every bit of planning you do for a scrap page should keep the amount of space in mind. Discard less important ideas in favor of better ones and give the central ideas more space.   Placement on the page is also important to consider. In general, the center of a page will be the most eye-catching. You can put less important concepts on the borders or edges.  , Even text itself can be considered part of the art on a scrapbook page. Choose a fitting title for your scrapbook and write it in using your best calligraphy. If you are unskilled with cursive writing, bubble letters also work well for this purpose.Some examples of page titles include:Family: ""A Family of Friends"" ""Generations of Love"" or ""Happiness is Homemade"" Graduation: ""Achieve"" ""Believe in Yourself"" or ""Dare to Dream"" Travels: ""Are We There Yet?"" ""Departures and Arrivals"" or ""Life is a Journey""  , A scrapbook should be a work of art. Even if you have a lot of material to cover the original page with, color the foundation. This will let color pop out where there may not have been any otherwise. Marker and watercolor paints are perfect for adding color between the cracks. If you use paint, allow the page time to dry before gluing on your images.You can also use patterned paper as a foundation for your scrap page. For example, use a patterned paper for your border or use cut-out shapes to add meaning to the page., With the help of a computer, take the photos you want to include and resize them according to the amount of space you have to work with. Because you'll have space for a limited number of photos, it is best to give the most space to the best photo, downsizing less important images for use on the sides of your page.Depending on your smartphone, you may even be able to resize photos using a photo editing application.  , Glue your photos onto pieces of cardstock before gluing them onto the page. Placing the images on bigger pieces of cardstock will function as a border. Choose an acid-free adhesive or use photo tabs to stick the photo onto your cardstock. Mark the page with a ruler so that you center the image correctly.If you don't want to use cardstock, you can stick the photo directly onto the scrapbook page or onto another piece of scrapbook paper. Just be sure to use paper that's larger than your image so you end up with a border., Although the photos in a scrapbook should tell enough of a story on their own, you can enrich their meaning by tacking on some context. Regardless of if it's a picture of a vacation, party or family reunion, saying a bit about where it is and why you were there will bring the memories rushing back.You should write up your text as a draft on another sheet of paper before writing it on the final copy. This will allow you to focus on the aesthetic of the text itself and figure out exactly what it is you would like to say before writing it permanently.  , With a scrapbook, you will not have a lot of space to say whatever it is you wish to communicate. With this in mind, be tactical and efficient with the words you use. Poetry and song lyrics are perfect in this sense, as they often communicate feelings better than regular prose would.   You can also include favorite inspiration quotes or quote people who were involved in the activity that the scrapbook page describes.  , Once all of your pages are in place, small stickers can be used as a pleasant add-on. Buy a few sheets of stickers from the dollar store and tack them around certain images as a border. It helps the effect if the stickers are somehow applicable to the theme of the scrapbook.For example, for a scrapbook page about a trip to the beach, you could use seashell stickers. Or, for a baby shower scrapbook page, stick on baby rattle and pacifier stickers.  , A scrapbook page is meant to preserve the feeling of a memory forever. You can increase the longevity of your scrapbook by laminating the pages. Then, be sure to store it in a book or folder where it won't be damaged.You can use a purchased scrapbook by filling in the pages. Or, you can make single scrapbook pages and have them professionally bound. This may preserve the scrapbook best.

Nod to show you’re actively engaged in what they have to say and that you empathize with their predicament. Be attentive but relaxed. Look the customer in the eye as they speak.   Keep an open mind when listening to the customer.In other words, don’t listen for what you think the problem is or might be. Rather, hear the customer out and understand their actual problem or issues. Don’t contradict or argue with what the customer says. Even if they are wrong, informing them of their error will only exacerbate their frustration. Do not minimize the customer’s complaint. Do not, for instance, say “Sometimes food is a little cold when it comes out. It’s no big deal.” This will not make the customer happy.; , Imagine the peas. Are they large or small? Round and smooth, or somewhat dimpled? Are they bright green, or more of a pine color? Finally, the texture. Imagine you have several between your hand which are soft and pliant. Several others are hard and undesirable in soup. You will better understand the customer’s problem armed with this mental vision.  , There are two ways to clarify a customer complaint in order to better understand and handle it. The first way is to ask questions about the complaint.The second way is to repeat the customer’s complaint back to them in different language.   For instance, if you’ve just arrived for your shift and a customer is complaining about the soup, you might not know what soup the customer is referring to. Ask questions as needed. You might inquire, “Did you have the pea soup or the vegetable noodle?” Don’t assume which menu item the customer is talking about; always follow up by asking for specifics as they explain their issue. Once the customer’s complaint has been explained, repeat it back to them in different language.For instance, the customer might complain that the food was cold. You could, after hearing the explanation, summarize their problem by saying, “So your food did not arrive at the temperature you wanted it to be at? Is that right?” If they agree, you’ve listened well and can move on to fixing the problem.  , Do not smile or laugh while listening to the customer’s complaint. Adopt a solicitous, concerned facial expression. Furrow your brow slightly in the center and turn down the corners of your mouth. This will make the customer feel as if you are truly concerned about what they have to say.   Even if the customer is using profanity or yelling rudely, do not respond in kind. Exercise patience and compassion. Listen patiently to the entirety of the customer’s complaint. If they are being particularly boisterous, direct the customer to follow you into a more private quarter of the dining establishment. There you can continue to listen to their tirade without drawing negative attention to the situation or disrupting the other diners., An apology is an acknowledgment that you made a mistake.Tell the customer, “I am so sorry for the error.” This will make the customer more inclined to forgive you and/or your restaurant. Be specific in your apology. If the soup was too cold, say “I am sorry the soup was too cold.” If the order was wrong, say, “I am sorry I brought you the wrong order.”   Always act sincere when apologizing, even if there is no real reason for you to apologize. It will make the customer feel better. Many customers appreciate an explanation, but do not appreciate excuses. For instance, you could say “I’m sorry, the line cook was confused about your order. I’ll fix it immediately.” But do not say, “The line cook mixed it up, not me. Just hang on while he fixes it.” Maintain a sense of personal responsibility even if the problem is not your fault, and avoid excusing yourself or anyone else. If you are very sorry, emphasize how sorry you feel by saying “I am very sorry this happened.” Apologies work online too. If your establishment is active on review sites like Google+ or Yelp, you can write apologies in response to bad experiences. Write something like, “We are sorry you had a bad experience in our dining establishment. I can understand why you were frustrated. We will investigate this matter in depth to ensure it does not happen again. Thank you for bringing it to our attention.”  , If a customer is waiting to order and another customer has a complaint, the customer with the complaint should be helped first. Only after their complaint has been heard and an apology issued should the other customer’s order be taken.   If the customer’s complaint involved re-making a dish, ensure that this remake goes to the front of the order list in the kitchen. Let kitchen staff know that they need to make the order a priority. If it is not possible to resolve the customer’s complaint in a way which satisfies them quickly or within the time they have completed their meal, get their contact info so that they can be contacted later with a solution. For instance, if the customer orders takeout and doesn’t have his order ready when he comes to pick it up, and doesn’t have time to wait for it to be made, tell him to write down his name and number and he will be eligible for a free order of equal value later at a time of his choosing.  , Thinking about the customer’s mood, the customer’s problem, and the options available to you to solve it will dictate your course of action.   Ask the customer what they’d like to have happen to rectify the situation. Consult with your manager or coworkers in order to determine how to move forward. If the customer’s request can be honored, do so. Otherwise, use the information you received from your coworkers or manager in order to propose an alternative to the customer. Think about how irate the customer is. If they’re extremely irritated and angry, you should go above and beyond to ensure they are placated. Consider offering them a large discount, 50-100% off their meal. If the customers is mildly or only slightly put out by the issue about which they are complaining, offer them a free drink or a free side. If the complaint isn’t terribly serious but intended more as an informational aside, such as “The table is a bit sticky,” you might just need to clean the table up a bit. Always follow your restaurant’s protocol when deciding how to handle customer complaints. Get your manager’s approval before extending an exceptionally generous offer like a free meal. Sometimes food just needs to be reheated, sometimes it needs to be completely remade, and sometimes the customer will accept another solution entirely. Regardless, remove the undesired item with the customer’s permission.  , Tell him or her, “One of my customers found the soup a bit too salty. Would you try it to see if it needs to be adjusted?” While it’s important for you to apologize and offer something else to the customer who complained, if there is a real problem with the soup, someone else will complain about it too, down the line, and then you’ll have to go through the whole apology and replacement process again.   Speaking with your coworkers is also important so you can understand what kinds of solutions are possible. For example, if the customer wants a replacement side of mashed potatoes, you’ll need to check with the kitchen before assuring the customer that you can replace them. It is possible that the kitchen has sold out of them for the night.  , The customers who do speak up are giving you an opportunity to improve on the dining experience, whether in the avenue of food quality, service, or dining atmosphere. Thank these customers by saying, “Thank you so much for bringing this matter to my attention.”  ",1327,"['specific situation', 'problem', 'question', 'eye', 'forms', 'share information', 'guest.let', 'priority', 'teammates.for instance', 'complaint', 'mind', 'cook', 'matter', 'experience', 'issue', 'it.for instance', 'variety', 'anything', 'problem.solutions', 'customer', 'guest', 'soup', 'attention.many customers', 'several little peas', 'everything', 'complaint.when']"

Some companies prefer that their employees maintain more formal appearances, while other companies allow employees to dress casually, five days a week. Don’t be shy to ask the hiring manager about the dress code before your first day of work.When in doubt, overdress! It's much better to be the only woman in a dress and heels on the first day of work, rather than the only woman in jeans. Dressing up shows that you take the job seriously, while under-dressing can give the impression that you don’t care as much.; , If you are expected to wear business suits every day, you need to invest in some fitted, high quality pieces. You don’t need to buy a new outfit for every day of the week, but it’s important to have some neutral-colored, “go to” items that you know are office-appropriate and you can easily mix and match.Even if your office is casual, it’s still important that you present yourself appropriately at your place of work. Ripped jeans, dirty sneakers, and belly-baring shirts are fine for the weekend, but keep a drawer stocked with modest, casual clothing specifically for the office.  , Again, every office has a different dress code, but this is a great rule of thumb. Make sure that your chest is fully covered when you head off to work.Not only is cleavage inappropriate in the office, but it’s also inconvenient to be holding your shirt up every time you reach for a paper or open a drawer! When it comes to tops, opt for ones with sleeves. To avoid looking inappropriate at your office, modest tops are your best bet.   Don’t confuse “modest” for “frumpy.” There is no shortage of trendy, fun tops that still keep you covered and appropriate for work. If you want to be taken seriously, let your work performance do the talking. If people are distracted by your voluptuous cleavage, they probably won’t notice the great work you’re doing. If you have a closet full of sleeveless tops that you want to wear, throw a cardigan or blazer on over top. These can easily take a top from backyard barbeque to board meeting.  , Nothing says professional like a great fitting blazer. Avoid boxy, “masculine” suits that mask your figure with hard, straight lines. Instead, find a blazer that slightly hugs your body while still giving you ample room to move. Pairing a crisp blazer with a floral top or a sweet dress can help you look work-appropriate and dainty at the same time.Pick up a blazer in the colors that you wear most often, such as black, cream, or navy, to get the most use out of it. When it comes to blazers, and all work clothes for that matter, you get what you pay for. Cheap clothing can seem like a bargain, but fall apart after a few washes. Loose strings, frayed hems, and holes can turn the most perfect, appropriate office outfit into a disaster.  , This bit of advice may sound antiquated, but it will ensure that you don’t look inappropriate at the office. Mini skirts and flirty dresses are fantastic, but they have no place at work. Make sure that your skirts and dresses hit at the knee or below. If you’re worried about looking unfashionable or overly modest, just make sure your skirts and dresses are properly tailored. You can show off your womanly curves while making sure your hemline is appropriate.Depending on just how formal your office is, you may need to slip on a pair of nude or black tights under your skirt.  , The word “slacks” may conjure up a picture of some repulsive, passé trousers, but don’t write them off just yet! Form-fitting, structured black pants are perfect office attire, and you can pair them with almost any type of top, blazer, or sweater. You can wear them through most seasons, and you won’t have to worry about hosiery or hemlines (or shaving your legs)!If the pants are a bit long, get them hemmed before wearing them. Scruffy, frayed hems do not look office-appropriate.  , Regardless of the footwear that your job calls for, you need to make sure that you can wear them for the duration of your workday. Ditch the sky-high heels for some more appropriate pumps or ballet flats. Stick to close-toed shoes to ensure you look appropriate.Some offices permit sandals or even sneakers, but just make sure you confirm this beforehand. Just like with your clothing, it’s better to be safe than sorry. For example, unless you've seen your boss wearing flip flops, don't wear flip flops! If you have a long commute, you can bring an extra pair of shoes. Some women prefer wearing comfortable walking shoes to and from work, and popping on a pair of heels for the work day.  , Statement necklaces, clunky bangles, or giant hoop earrings can be a lot of fun to wear, but leave them at home. The most work-appropriate jewelry consists of pieces that add a little sparkle, but don’t blind. Delicate necklaces, stud earrings, watches, and other unobtrusive pieces can help pull a look together without distracting observers. Less is more!, Cross-body bags, colorful totes, and backpacks can be great for other things, but a sleek, structured bag is perfect for the office. Make sure that it can fit everything you need for a full day of work, because it won't look appropriate if your bag is bursting at the seams and spilling all over your desk space.   You can spend a good deal of money on a designer bag for work, or you can check discount stores for a steal. The only nonnegotiable criteria for a work bag is that it looks clean and in good condition.  , The key to keeping your makeup office-appropriate is to remember that you should only be enhancing your natural features. Appropriate makeup can actually help to give you a neat and professional appearance.Neon blue eye shadow and hot pink lipstick doesn’t exactly create an au natural appearance, so leave that look for after hours. Instead, opt for neutral colors that only highlight your own beautiful features.   Unless you need the full coverage of a foundation, use a simple tinted moisturizer to even out your skin tone. This will even out your complexion while still being light and fresh-looking.Rub some light concealer under your eyes to remove dark circles. Use mascara to accentuate your eyelashes while making your eyes look bright. Avoid dark eye shadows and eyeliners, as they can appear dramatic and inappropriate for the office environment. Nude or very light eye shadows are acceptable. Limit your lipstick or lip gloss to natural colors. Make sure you bring it with you so you can re-apply throughout the day.  , You don’t need to create a fancy up-do every day before work, but it’s important to make sure your hair looks polished and tidy every day. It is inappropriate and distracting to have hair hanging down over your eyes and face. If you wear your hair down, make sure it’s tucked behind your ears or held back with a headband. To get it away from your face, a simple bun or ponytail is fine.Dry shampoo works wonders if your hair is prone to becoming limp and greasy, and you don’t want to shampoo it daily. Spritz a little in your hair before work and it will look clean and smell great.  , The importance of this office etiquette cannot be overstated. It is extremely inappropriate to come to work without brushing your teeth, combing your hair, or taking a shower. No one wants to be in close quarters with someone who did not have the common courtesy to clean themselves up.   Wear deodorant. It doesn’t matter if you don’t think you’ll sweat. Wear deodorant. Use perfume and body spray sparingly. Even if you love the scent, it can be overwhelming when you’re in a small office, especially if everyone else is also wearing scented sprays. Brush your teeth before work, and bring your toothbrush or mouthwash with you for after lunch. Oral hygiene is especially crucial if you’re talking with co-workers or customers all day.

When looking for a material to use, gravitate toward fabrics that are fairly stiff and heavy. Light, floppy material will produce a floppy hat.   Craft felt is one of the most popular options you can use. It is easy to find, affordable, easy to work with, and comes in a range of colors. Polar fleeceand tightly-woven wool are other possible options. Fosshape,buckram, and plastic canvas can be a little harder to find and a little more expensive, but they also tend to be a little stiffer and may produce a more pleasing result when all is said and done. If you cannot find these materials in the color you want, you can paint or dye them that color.; , You will need to cut out two round circles of equal proportions. The longest diameter of these circles should be about 15 inches (38 cm).   The brim pieces will be stacked and sewn together to create a double layer. This is done so that the brim has more structure and support. If you only use one piece of material for the brim, it may lack the structure it needs to be convincing.  , The flue is the tall, chimney-like portion of the top hat that creates the signature look of the style. You will need to cut out two rectangular flue pieces of equal proportions. The length should be 6 1/2 inches (16.5 cm) and the width should be 24 inches (61 cm).   Like the brim, the “flue” will also consist of a double layer of fabric for the purpose of providing adequate support. Without this double layer, the top hat is likely to sink or fold over on itself once you place it on your head. If you would like to create a more playful version of the top hat, you can also cut out separate bands in alternating colors to form the flue. Stitch the bands together lengthwise so that they form a single flue piece with a height of 6 1/2 inches (16.5 cm).  , You only need to cut out one piece of material for the top of the hat. Cut a circle that is 8 inches (20.3 cm) in diameter.   Unlike the brim and the flue, the top piece or “lid” does not need to have much structure, so you only need one piece of fabric for it. If you do not like the look of a single layer, however, you can double this part of the hat up, as well, by adding a second piece of equal dimensions.  , Place the two brim pieces on top of each other, right sides facing in and wrong sides facing out. Pin in place.   When you insert the straight pins, slide them into both layers around the shared edge. You need to use enough pins to prevent the two layers from moving around along the edge, since the edge is where you must sew the brim together to start with.  , Use a fabric pencil or a piece of chalk to sketch out a smaller circle in the center of the larger brim circle. This circle should be about as big around as the size of your head.   This circle will eventually become the opening for your head, which is why it needs to be the same approximate size. Use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your head to verify that the circle in the center of your brim piece matches. Usually, the inner circle will be about 6 inches (15.24 cm) in diameter.  , Use a sewing machine or a needle and thread to sew around the outside edge of the pieces, leaving a seam allowance of about 1/8 inch (3.176 mm).   Do not sew along the edge of the inner circle yet. When done, you should have a solid, round disk with a circle marked in the center. Remove the pins as you sew or after you finish.  , Use sewing scissors or shears to cut alone the outline you marked at the center of the brim. Cut from the inside of the circle, not along the outside.   If you have difficulty keeping the pieces from shifting or moving around at the center, you could remedy the situation by pinning around the outside of the drawn circle before cutting that circle out. Doing so should limit the amount of movement.  , Pull the brim right-side out by turning it through the opening you created by cutting out the center of the brim.   Iron flat, if possible, so that the material is easier to work with.  , Stitch up the open center of the brim using a sewing machine or needle and thread. Leave a seam allowance of 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).   As before, if you find that the fabric around the center opening continues to move around, pin around the opening to restrict this movement.  , Place one flue piece on top of the other, with the wrong sides facing out and the right sides facing in. Pin together.   You need to pin around all four parts of the rectangle. Place the pins as close to the edge as possible to prevent the edges from coming loose as you sew.  , Sew around all four sides of the two stacked pieces to create a double-layer piece to work with.   You should have a seam allowance of about 1/8 inch (3.176 mm).  , Lightly fold the flue in half width wise and pin the edges together. Sew along the joined edge using a sewing machine or needle.   Do not iron or crease the fold. Ultimately, you will want this part of the hat to have a rounded shape, not a flat shape. The seam allowance will vary depending on how large your head is. The portion of the fabric leading up to the seam should be about half of the diameter of your brim opening, and when unfolded, this portion of the flue should be about the same size as that brim opening.  , Release the fold of the flue and try to shape it with your fingers so that the flue shape, as a whole, forms a rounded shape.   If there is a crease along the side you folded previously and you cannot get it out simply with your fingers, you could try placing the flue over a round vase, lamp, or similar object to stretch it in that circular shape. Remove the crease by applying steam with your iron.  , Place the lid piece wrong-side up on your working surface and set the flue wrong-side out on top. Pin in place.   Pin the pieces together as close to the edge as possible to prevent them from wiggling apart.  , Sew the flue to the lid using a sewing machine or needle. Leave a seam allowance of 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).   Turn the flue and top right-side out once the two pieces have been attached.  , Pull the bottom edge of the flue slightly through the hole you cut in the brim, leaving 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3.175 to 6.35 mm) of fabric beneath the brim. Pin in place.   Pin the overhanging portion of the flue fabric to the underside of the brim, placing the pins as close to the edge as possible.  , Sew the overhanging portion of flue fabric to the underside of the brim using a sewing machine or needle.   The seam allowance should only be about 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).  , Any excess fabric on the inside of the brim or flue should be trimmed away with sewing scissors or shears.   While this is not strictly essential since the excess fabric should be hidden, it might make the hat more comfortable to wear.  , You can leave the top hat plain and wear it as is, or you can add decorative elements to it to personalize it or make it usable for a costume.  If you are using the hat for cosplay or costume purposes, study pictures of the character you are trying to dress as and decorate the hat accordingly. If you want the top hat to look more “classic,” you could try embellishing it by attaching a black satin ribbon around the base of the flue. To make the top hat more versatile, add embellishments that are removable.  , Your top hat should now be complete and ready to wear.",1411,"['new top hat', 'flue pieces', 'pieces', 'excess material', 'top hat', 'brim pieces', 'top piece', 'flue', 'piece', 'center', 'portion', 'circle', 'brim', 'lid', 'material']"

These options include a Switch Control system.  However, the iPad does not contain jacks that permit a switch to be connected directly to it. Instead one must connect a switch control device, such as the Tecla Shield, to the iPad via a wireless Bluetooth connection, and then plug a pillow switch, or some other switch such as a puff sip switch, into the switch control device.; , This will allow you to control the iPad.  , iBooks seems to be the best iPad reader for single switch use, much easier to use than Read2Go or the Kindle app. It allows you to turn a page by clicking and then waiting for the scanner to move only two times, before clicking twice again. If you want to turn several pages or more at a time (in effect, skimming ahead or back), you can do that with any number of rapid clicks (not waiting between clicks). It allows a smooth adjustment of font sizes so that you can pick the one that is perfect for you. It never causes a reading page to extend beyond the page boundaries, so that you never have to scroll up or down, except when you are looking through an index. As an Apple proprietary app, its performance seems pretty solid.  , Bookshare.org is a wonderful resource, providing access to many excellent books, magazines and newspapers that you can download without charge (after paying $25 to join and a $50 annual fee). You must have a disability and be able to get a professional to certify to that fact in order to join Bookshare. Unfortunately, Bookshare’s DAISY files will not work with iBooks, which uses the EPUB format. Therefore, you will need to convert the DAISY files you get from Bookshare to the EPUB format – see the instructions below.  ,, If you're using a Tecla Shield, you should see a fairly rapid (1 blink per second) flashing white light coming from the circuit board inside. This means that the device is in “Switch Control” mode and also that it is ready to pair.    If you want to pair the Tecla to a new device, you must first unpair it from the old one.  If the light is flashing some other color, use the tip of a pen and push on either the “-“ or the “+” button until the light begins to flash rapidly.  The light will eventually begin to flash a different color.  Repeat this step until the light is flashing white, about one blink per second, indicating that the Tecla is ready for pairing.  ,  This will reduce the amount of time required to press and hold the pillow switch in order to return to the iPad’s Home screen.  , This is primarily useful for reading incoming emails in the iPad's Mail app. Go to Settings, Display and Brightness, Text Size, and adjust the slider to change the text size. Check the results by looking at an incoming message in the Mail app.  If you need to use even larger text, go to Settings, General, Accessibility, Larger Text, and then turn Larger Accessibility Sizes on. You can now move another slider to adjust text size. Again, check the results in the Mail app. If the text size is set too large, the lines of text may overlap and become unreadable.  , Turn Bluetooth on, and pair the iPad with the switch control device.  To do this, click the name of the device (e.g. TeclaShieldDOS) listed under Devices. The status should change from Not Paired to Connected.     If the pairing doesn’t work, try removing the device from My Devices by pushing the small “i” button to the right of it and clicking Forget This Device.  Then try pairing again. After the switch control device is paired, the white light will flash much more slowly.  ,  Remove any previous settings.  Set Accessibility Shortcut to Switch Control.  This will allow you to turn switch control off and on by triple-tapping rapidly on the iPad’s home button.  ,  Activate the pillow switch by pressing it. Click Save.  Choose Select Item from the switch action menu that will pop up.  , Go to Settings, General > Accessibility > Switch Control. The following settings are recommended:   Set Auto Scanning to on.  You may adjust the Auto Scanning Time. Two seconds or less may work for somewhat experienced users, but beginners may need a longer time. This sets the speed in Item Scanning (as opposed to Point Scanning). Turn Pause on First Item on.  Set the pause duration to 1 second, initially.  This setting allows the user to think for a moment when a new menu line pops up, before deciding what to do next. Set the Loops to 2, initially. This is the number of times that the scanner will circle the available options before it stops. Having more loops gives you more time to choose from the different options while the scanner lines are moving, but it slows things down. Turn Auto Tap off. Turn Move Repeat off. Turn Hold Duration off. Turn Ignore Repeat off. Set Gliding Cursor speed to 15. You may need to set this speed to a lower number at first. This sets the speed in Point Scanning (as opposed to Item Scanning). Set Sound Effects off. Set Speech off. Set Included Menu items to all. Set Group Items to on. Set Large Cursor to on (All). Set Cursor Color to Blue (or whatever color you like). Set Saved Gestures to None.  , Go to the iPad’s Settings > General > Accessibility, Switch Control. Turn Switch Control on.  Note that you may also turn switch control off and on by triple-tapping rapidly on the iPad’s Home button (the large button on the front).  This is the Accessibility Shortcut mentioned above.  Turning switch control off will allow someone to use the iPad in the normal way.  Turning switch control on will cause scanning to start.  , Switch control on the iPad relies on two very different scanning methods:  item scanning and point scanning.    Item scanning, in which the scanner jumps from one item or group of items to another, is much easier to use, since it requires fewer clicks once you have settled into an activity like reading.  However, it’s important to learn how to use point scanning as well, since it gives you more control and flexibility.  Point scanning employs lines that move smoothly across the screen, horizontally and then vertically, requiring the user to click at precise locations to form X’s (or crosses).  You cannot switch between item scanning and point scanning by using the iPad’s Options settings.  Instead, you must use the submenus that pop up after you have selected a point on the screen with either scanning method – see the instructions below.  , Item scanning highlights an item or a group of items for a short time and then jumps to another item or group of items. To change to item scanning, select something on the screen, click on the tiny Oval icon that pops up, click on the second row of the first submenu that pops up, and click on Item mode.  , Point scanning uses lines that move smoothly across the screen.  To change to point scanning, select something on the screen, click on the tiny Oval icon that pops up, click on the second row of the submenu that pops up, and click on Point mode.  , Note that anyone can practice operating an iPad with a single switch, even if he or she doesn’t have a Tecla Shield and a pillow switch.  To do this, set up your switch type by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > Switch Control > Switches, Add New Switch - all as described above - but this time choose Screen rather than External as the switch type.  Then choose Full Screen, Select Item.  After these steps have been taken, a caretaker with an iPad can simulate using a pillow switch by simply touching anywhere on the iPad’s screen and thus gain valuable experience in controlling the iPad with a single switch.  , Make sure that Item Scanning is on. Make sure that Groups are set to On. Make sure that Passcode in the iPad is turned Off. Go to Settings, Passcode.  ,   If the iPad is asleep, wake it up by clicking once on the pillow switch. If the iPad is locked, click the pillow switch. Scanning will start.  When the highlight reaches the Slide to Unlock area, click it again.  Note that, when you click the switch, a small black Popup menu will often be displayed.  The Popup menu contains choices.  The first choice is Tap.  If you click on Tap, that will select “Slide to Unlock” in the initial screen - but you must click right away, before the other choices come up.  If you don’t click Tap in time, or if you click at the wrong time, just wait for the highlight to come around to Tap again.  You should only have to wait for the highlight to go around two times, if you have set the Loops to 2 (see above).  Then, when it stops moving, you can click again to start scanning and wait for the right moment to click a second time in order to choose the option you want.  , Suppose you are in the Home screen or some other app screen and you want to open an app.  Stop and wait until a grouping containing that app is highlighted, click that grouping, stop and wait until the app is highlighted, click that app, and then click Tap.  , Suppose you are in the Home screen and you want to move to another screen.  Select any app as described above, but this time don’t click Tap.  Instead, wait a moment until the Scroll Right choice is highlighted, and then click that choice to move to the second screen.  , Suppose you want to go back to the Home screen.  Click on any app, as described above, but do not click Tap.  Instead wait until the little Oval Icon at the bottom of the popup menu is highlighted and click on that.  Then wait until the top row of choices is highlighted and click on that row.  Then wait until Home is highlighted and click on Home.  , Another way to return to the Home screen is to simply press and hold the pillow switch for about five seconds.  , See settings directions above.  ,  Click on the book you want to read.  When you want to turn a page, click and wait for the scanner to highlight the Progress Bar (the long thin line) at the bottom of the page.  Then click.  This will bring up a menu with three choices:  Decrement, Increment and the Oval icon.  Click on Decrement to turn the page to the left.  Click on Increment to turn the page back to the right.  Click on the Oval icon, to see the first submenu.  ,  You get to the first submenu by clicking on the Oval icon, which appears after you have selected something on the screen.  Then you will see Home, Gestures and Escape in the first row.  When the highlight gets to the second row, if you are in Item mode, you will see Point Mode, Device and Settings.  (If you are in Point Mode, you will see Item Mode, Device and Settings.)  Wait until the highlight reaches the row you want, click once, and then wait until the item you want is highlighted before clicking again.  ,  If you select Settings in the second row of the first submenu, you go to the second submenu.  Here you will see Back, Speed Up, Slow Down, and Move Menu.  In the second row, you will see Scan Order, Speech Off, Sound Off and Groups On.  To change the Scan Order, click on Scan Order in the second row.  , If necessary, you can use the Move Menu choice to move the popup menu so that it is out of the way.  The Bottom or Bottom Right positions are probably best, so that the popup menu will be out of the way when you start reading a page and usually disappear by the time you get to the bottom of the screen.  , When reading a book in the iBooks app, it's better to reverse the scan direction, so that the highlight will arrive at the Progress Bar at the bottom of the page more quickly, allowing you to turn a page by clicking and waiting for the scanner highlight to move two times (as opposed to five or six times with forward scanning, depending on whether the iPad is in Landscape or Portrait mode), before clicking twice again to finish turning the page., When scanning in Item Mode, it's faster to group choices together into groups. If you see Groups Off, click on this icon to turn Groups On., Note:  these instructions are based on experience with a Windows 7 desktop PC, but they could be adapted for use with other PC's.  , As mentioned above, Bookshare’s DAISY files will not work with iBooks, which uses the EPUB format.  To convert DAISY files to the EPUB format, a range of options area available; DAISYtoEPUB is recommended ($99).  You should install this program on the same computer where you have installed the iTunes program that you use to control your iPad.  The seller does not allow multiple installations.  , When you install the DAISYtoEPUB program on a desktop computer, you may experience problems with Java, which is required for the program to work.  For example, you may see the error message:  “Could not create the Java virtual machine.”  To fix this problem, you may have to increase the amount of RAM allocated to Java to 1024 MB, rather than the 512 MB suggested in this footnote., To download books from Bookshare, use the computer where you have installed DAISYtoEPUB.  Make sure that you are not logged in to Bookshare on any other devices.  Then go to bookshare.org and log in.  Type the name of the author or book that you would like to download in the search box at the top of the page and push Enter.  When you see a book that you like, click on the Download button to the far right of that title.  After the file finishes downloading, you should find it in the Downloads folder on your computer.  , To convert books to the EPUB format, open the DAISYtoEPUB program.  When this program opens, you will see 3 boxes to complete.  The second box is already completed for you, and you don’t need to change it, if you don’t mind storing EPUB books in the My Documents folder.  To complete the first box, click the Browse button to the right of the box and find the book that you want to convert, located in the Downloads folder.  If you double-click on this title, both the first and third boxes will get filled in automatically.  Then click on Convert and wait for the file to be converted to EPUB and stored in the My Documents folder.  , To do this, start iTunes by clicking on the icon on your laptop’s desktop.  In iTunes, click on File, Add File to Library.  (If you do not see ""File"" in iTunes, click on the tiny black and white box in the extreme upper left corner of the screen, and then click on Add File to Library. Alternatively, you may use Control-B to to make ""File"" visible in the Windows version of iTunes.) Locate the book you want to transfer inside the My Documents folder and double-click on it.  It will be transferred to iTunes.  , To transfer your EPUB books to the iPad, start iTunes and then connect the iPad to your computer.  After awhile, a small icon representing your iPad will appear on the main screen of iTunes, in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  Click on this icon.  In the next screen, click on Books in the list on the left.  On the right side of the screen, make sure you have selected Sync Books, All Books (or at least Selected Books, with your new book checked).  If you make any changes to these settings, sync the iPad again.  After the iPad sync is complete, click on the icon in the upper left corner, next to your iPad’s name, which ejects the iPad.  Then disconnect the iPad and open the iBooks app on the iPad.  You should see your new book listed in iBooks.  , If you find that the horizontal Progress Bar (long thin line) at the bottom of the screen in iBooks has been replaced by a vertical line on the right side of the screen, that means that someone must have accidentally turned on Scrolling View in iBooks. Scrolling View will cause the Progress Bar to appear on the right side of the screen, and this will make it much more difficult for you to turn pages. To correct this problem, click on the AA icon at the top of the screen in iBooks, and then turn off Scrolling View. If you are using only the pillow switch to perform this action, you will now find yourself ""stuck in a box,"" unable to exit the menu that pops up when you click on the AA icon. To get out of this box, see the instructions below.  , If you ever find that clicking on the pillow switch doesn’t do anything at all, make sure that the Tecla Shield has power and is turned on. If that isn't the problem, reboot the iPad by pressing the large Home button on the face of the iPad and the Power button on the side of the iPad together for at least 10 seconds.  After the screen becomes dark, wait another 10-20 seconds or so. If the machine doesn't come back on again by itself, push the iPad’s side Power button briefly to turn it back on.  , When you are in item scanning mode and using iBooks, sometimes you may find yourself stuck inside a box and unable to get out.  You will know that you are stuck inside a box if the highlight only flashes on a single box of text, or if it flashes on one box of text and then on another, but it doesn’t flash on other options on the page, so that you are unable to turn pages.  , To reproduce this condition of being stuck inside a box, so that you may practice how to deal with it, first turn the pillow switch OFF (or turn the screen switch OFF, if you are using a screen switch in Caretaker Practice Mode). You may do this either by triple-clicking on the Start button or by going to the iPad’s Settings > General > Accessibility, Switch Control, Switch Control Off.  Next open iBooks and open a book in iBooks.  Notice that when you touch the screen, the Progress Bar (long thin line) at the bottom of the screen will appear and disappear.  When the line is no longer present, turn the pillow switch or the screen switch back ON, either by triple-clicking on the Start button or by going to Settings > General > Accessibility, Switch Control, Switch Control On.  You should now find yourself stuck inside a box.  , If you are stuck inside a box, change from item scanning to point scanning.  Carefully select a point near the bottom of the screen, where you know that the Progress Bar (the long thin line) should be, and click on Tap.  The Progress Bar will reappear.  , Next click on an Oval icon and go to the first submenu, where you can change from point scanning back to item scanning.  , Click on Groups Off, if that is being displayed, or on Groups On, if that is being displayed.  That should fix the problem of being stuck inside a box. However, if you now find yourself with Groups Off, that will slow scanning down, and you will probably want to turn Groups On again.",3386,"['settings', 'point/item mode', 'use', 'books', 'caretaker practice mode', 'pen', 'pc', 'default text size', 'input', 'direction', 'menu', 'home', 'switch control settings', 'itunes', 'epub format', 'view', 'person', 'ibooks', 'switch control device', 'first submenu', 'ipad', 'box', 'tip', 'side', 'new switch', 'switch', 'moment', 'java', 'order choice', 'fix problems', 'second submenu', 'screen switch', 'bookshare', 'download books', 'turn groups', 'item scanning', 'button', 'setting', 'home screen', 'app', 'daisy files', 'puff sip switch', 'pillow', 'switch control', 'scanning', 'liking', 'screen', 'move menu choice', 'order', 'point scanning', 'epub books', 'transfer books', 'times', 'practice reading', 'pillow switch', 'power switch', 'groups']"

You don't want to completely reject the healthy relationship that you've established between each other, but you need to take care of your feelings. Don't make active efforts to see them on a daily basis.   There are countless ways to set up safe and respectful boundaries between you and this person.If you do see this person, be open without giving them all of your attention. Protect yourself without isolating them. Prepare some reasonable excuses why you can't see this person. You might feel like you are deceiving your friend, especially if you have an honest history. Just know that you are doing this only because you need time to get over him or her.Monetary related issues are nearly always understandable, especially if it's in relation to having to work longer hours. If you work longer hours, then you're more tired, and exhaustion should always be a viable excuse.; , Before creating an extreme distance, you want to make sure that you really are in love with this person. There's an immense amount of pressure riding on this situation, as you're running the risk of permanently damaging a friendship.   When you're in love, the central dopamine levels in your brain will ramp up, giving you an intense attention and focus on the person that you're falling for.Your love object will be occupying a great deal of your daily thoughts, so it may feel like you are obsessing over them. It's unlikely, if you're really in love with this person, that you're thinking about anyone else. Your thoughts will all be overly positive, as you overlook your love object's negative traits when you've fallen for them. If you feel any or all of these things, you may actually be in love with your best friend. You must make sure that you aren't feeling this way because you're lonely and have a strong platonic bond with this person. You run the risk, when considering your love for your best friend, of misinterpreting the caring relationship between you for romantic love.Make sure that you aren't reaching out to this person because you want a romantic relationship, and they seem like a good fit.  , There's nothing worse, after going through a trying emotional circumstance like a rejection, than pushing your feelings away and hiding from them. Even worse is tricking yourself into believing that you aren't allowed to feel those emotions.If you judge your emotions, or tell yourself that you aren't allowed to feel them, then you're hiding from the realness of your pain. Even though it's immensely difficult to cope with heartbreak, you will become stronger in the process. You will also spend less time wallowing if you accept your emotions and try to focus on the present.  , If you allow this rejection to completely shatter your well-being, you stand no chance of getting over your heartbreak. Even though it requires a little extra effort, you have to make active strides in improving your self-worth.Remember that your rejection does not rest entirely on your character. Your best friend might be coping with some massive issues with their own identity. This person may be afraid to commit themselves to you because of fear and insecurity. Being alone will help you grow, and even though it feels like an insurmountable pain, you'll be stronger as a result. Try to see this as an opportunity to improve upon yourself, or take time to work on your own goals. Rejection has the potential to fuel your drive as a human being, as you can use these bad feelings to inform your forward momentum.If you fall back into a self-deprecating spiral, you won't be able to move beyond your pain. Remembering that rejection is inevitable will make this particular rejection seem less significant.  , While it may seem counterproductive, you actually don't want to block this person out of your brain entirely. When you attempt to push all thoughts of this person away from you, you'll no doubt return to thinking of them when you don't want to. This actually makes it much tougher to get over them.   Known as the ""White Bear Effect,"" your active attempts to not think about a white bear will undoubtedly make a white bear pop into your mind.This is the case with all addictions and obsessions. When your love object enters your mind, you must acknowledge their existence, despite the pain. You don't need to panic, and you certainly don't need to take it as a sign that you'll never get over them.  , When you've been rejected by your love interest, you'll immediately feel a great amount of self-hatred and insecurity. You've put it all on the line, and you will probably feel like you've failed in some way.Becoming confident in yourself again is crucial in overcoming the hardship.   You need to learn how to reconnect with your emotions in the present, rather than thinking about the mistakes of your past. Meditation helps in centering your brain toward the now. A simple cross-legged meditation is a good place to start. Hold your spine tall and bring your hands to the center of your heart. Keep your palms held together, with the thumbs and the pinkies aligned. Bring your focus to the tip of your nose and breathe. When you release your fear and anxiety about the past, you'll be able to use the energy you've gained in moving forward with strength.  , It's crucial, in overcoming heartbreak, that you lean on those around you. Remember how necessary these friendships are to your well-being, and how well you've been treated by these individuals in the past.If you have great friends, then you have friends that you can be yourself around.   Depending on how tumultuous your romantic feelings toward your best friend have been, you may have felt distant from your other friendships for quite some time. Because you can't pine over this person anymore, you can focus your energy on healthier relationships in your life.  , In the aftermath of a deep heartbreak, you are wrapped in a large number of varying emotions. These can range from anxiety, anger, and deep sorrow, among others. Keep in mind, however, that while these feelings exist, they are not absolute fact.Coined by Tibetan Buddhist teacher Tsoknyi Rinpoche, the phrase ""real but not true,"" is important to keep in mind when processing these emotions. You can validate that you are feeling a certain way without giving absolute power to the emotions.  , While it may take a bit of extra effort on your part, it's not a bad idea to try dating another person, even if you're still recovering.You should not attempt to replace your broken heart. It's not a bad idea, however, to spend time with someone in a casual romantic setting.   Don't inundate your date with your sad story. They shouldn't have to be burdened with what you're going through. Even if nothing comes of your date, you can definitely find comfort in your connection with another person. If anything, setting up a profile on OKCupid or another dating site will provide you with some positive reinforcement from strangers.It's not going to solve your problems, but any positive word from those around you will help you heal.  , While this is a necessary step for any heartbreak, it's especially important when your love object holds a dear place in your heart as a longtime friend.Any malice sent toward this person will only exacerbate your problems.   It may seem unproductive, especially when this person has very recently broken your heart, but extending love toward this person will actually help you get over them. It can add to your peace of mind and stability, and you'll eliminate a lot of potential cynicism. This does not mean that you should extend this love to this person in a tangible way. Don't give them attention through the internet or send a text. You can, however, wish them positive feelings when by yourself.  , While it's the worst case scenario in this sort of situation, there's a possibility that the confusion of the situation might have driven you two apart forever.More than likely, you will be the person who can't move beyond the weight of the situation, as your feelings have proven to be unrequited.   If you've taken the proper time to be alone and get yourself back on track, then you can decide whether or not you feel ready to be friends again. Don't be hard on yourself if you're having trouble moving on. It may require far more time than you initially anticipated. With more time apart, new feelings for others may enter your brain. This may or may not help you get over your former love object.  , It's a lot easier to manage your friendship if you're not spending a lot of one-on-one time with your best friend. It's still important to maintain boundaries with this person, even if it's difficult.Your impulse might be to continue doing all the same activities that you did when you were best friends. For the time being, you'll want to avoid anything too intimate or private.   Figure out what sort of relationship you might have with this person. You may not be able to spend time alone watching television, but perhaps you can still chat over a beer or cup of coffee.  , Remember, if your friend is happy, you should be too. This is where being mature comes in. You love your friend, and you want him or her to be happy, whatever the decision may be.   Be sure that you're actively pushing through the awkwardness. Figure out your new boundaries as friends. You'll both have to change your expectations and assess what you're allowed to do, so this should start with acceptance of your present situation.

No matter how hard it is, don’t let yourself yell back, even if your child is yelling at you at the top of their lungs.; , Even if you keep your cool, it doesn't feel good to get yelled at. Furthermore, you need to break your child of the habit of raising their voice to you before they begin to think that it's acceptable behavior.   If it's a relatively new behavior, be understanding with them and explain why yelling doesn't help: ""I understand that you're upset, but yelling doesn't do anything but get both of us riled up. The more worked up we get, the less likely we'll be to reach a happy ending here."" If it's repeated behavior, be firmer: ""I do my very best to never raise my voice to you, no matter how upset I get. I expect the same courtesy from you."" If your teenager has made a habit out of being smart with you, set firm, strict boundaries in a confident tone: ""I don't know what you think you're going to accomplish by being sarcastic with me. At the end of the day, I'm still your parent, and you need to watch your tone and lower your voice before I double your punishment.""  , Everyone can think back to a time when they snapped at someone without thinking first about what they were saying — usually, you regret it immediately. Take a few seconds to work through your immediate reaction of frustration or anger before responding to your child. Your teenager is coming from an uncontrollably emotional place, but it’s on you as an adult and parent to speak from a place of reason.   Don’t worry about voicing your personal frustration; instead, focus on what you can say that will actually elicit the desired behavior from your child.  , It may be helpful to breathe deeply for a few moments to get your breathing and heart rate under control. By consciously reducing the physical symptoms of agitation, you can put yourself in a calmer mindset. Counting to ten is a useful tool, though it may take longer to get yourself under control.  , If your reaction is so strong that deep breathing and counting to ten don’t work, you need to take a break from the conversation, and ask your teenager to do the same. While decompressing, do something that relieves your stress: read a book, knit, cook, lay down and close your eyes — whatever you need to do to feel better.   ""I'm too upset right now to speak calmly, and so are you. I'm worried that we're going to say hurtful things to each other, so other, so we should take a break."" ""I love you very much, but I think we need to be apart for fifteen minutes before we can continue this discussion."" ""Let's both go into our rooms and calm down. When I feel ready to talk, I'll wait for you in the living room, and you do the same if you calm down before me."" Don’t restart the conversation until you’ve both plateaued emotionally.  , When emotions are high, hearing the word “you” over and over again will make anyone feel attacked, and that’s not what you want. Instead of attacking the teenager about their bad attitude, try to make them understand how their words and actions make life harder for the people around them, including you. For example, try saying:   “I feel bad when you speak to me this way” instead of “you have a bad attitude.” “I get exhausted between working and cleaning up after everyone at home” instead of “you never clean up your messes.” “Your father/mother is going through a rough patch right now” instead of “you need to be nicer to your mother/father.”  , Pay attention to the situations that seem to elicit the worst behavior from your teenager. It may be that your child is most irritable immediately after school, but that they calm down after they’ve had a snack or nap. It may be that they act out more when they have a lot of work for school, or when they’re fighting with a friend or significant other.   By being alert to the situations that trigger your teen’s worst behavior, you have a choice to either give them more leeway or to proactively lessen their stress. Be proactive by making their lives easier: have snacks waiting in the kitchen after school; help them with their homework; etc.  , While it’s very difficult to watch your child go from a sweet, loving child to a combative teen, you have to remember that to a certain degree, their backtalk has nothing to do with you. Beginning with early adolescence (age 12-14), a healthy child will begin to develop a new and, to them, groundbreaking awareness that adults, including their parents, are not infallible.As they’re struggling to reconcile what they’ve always thought about you with this new realization that you are a flawed human being, it’s perfectly normal for them to lash out from time to time before they learn how to relate to you as one adult to another.   Remember that it’s not just your child. Talk to your friends with similarly-aged children, and you’ll find that all teenagers act out to some degree.  , Bad behavior in a child is infuriating, and it’s very difficult to get beyond the frustration you rightly feel. However, it’ll be much easier for you to keep your cool if you try to consider the experience from their perspective. Think back to your own adolescence — odds are high that you said your own share of hurtful things to your parents. Some things to remember about life from your teenager’s point of view include:   Egocentrism, or the belief that their interpretation of the situation is the only possible correct interpretation is a normal part of cognitive development.Your child’s brain is developing the capability to grow beyond egocentrism, but it’s not finished yet. For example, when they were three, they might stand in front of the TV and not understand that just because they could see the TV didn’t mean that others in the room could see through their body. As teenagers, they’ve developed beyond that — but there’s still a ways to go. Your teenager’s brain is developing in a way that allows them to grasp abstraction in a new way, and for the first time.Injustices seem to be everywhere — but without the wisdom that comes with life experience, and without the cognitive ability to flesh out the logical repercussions of their abstract thinking. Because of this, they get incredibly worked up about things that seem insignificant from an adult’s perspective. But remember that their brains are still developing important cognitive functions that will allow them to see the way you, as an adult, do with time.  , While it’s true that parenting is a day-to-day judgment of which hill to die on, there’s a difference between keeping calm and letting your teenager get away with bad behavior. Although you don’t want to get into a fight with your child every time they mutter under their breath or roll their eyes, you do want to engage them in discussions frequently enough to send a clear message that all such behavior is inappropriate.   Decide which behaviors you will tolerate and which ones you will engage.One method might be to let nonverbal rudeness like excessive sighing and eye-rolling slide, while engaging with verbal backtalk.  , If your child does not have a clear sense of where the boundaries are in family interactions, they won’t be able to stay within your limits. Creating an explicit, written contract about the repercussions for backtalking and other bad behavior is a good way to establish boundaries.Although confrontation is exhausting, it’s very important that you be a verbal communicator when your child breaks the contract. Be explicit about which parts of your teenager’s behavior or language crosses the line between acceptable teenaged acting out and problematic disrespect. For example:   “It’s perfectly fine for you to tell me that you’re too tired to clean your room right now — I understand that you have a lot of schoolwork right now. However, raising your voice to me like this isn’t acceptable, and will result in punishment every time.” ""You may not be able to control rolling your eyes, but you can control raising your voice and being sarcastic. That crosses the line."" ""I respect that you're upset that I'm grounding you — I would be upset, too. But even though I'm upset with you right now, I haven't cursed at you. You're allowed to be mad at me, but you're not allowed to use disrespectful language.""  , If you apply punishments haphazardly, your teenager will not be receiving a clear message about the repercussions of their back-talking. Explain to your child what the precise repercussions will be for bad behavior so they know exactly what’s coming down the pipeline when they act up. For example, tell them that:   ""I understand that you're young, and sometimes you're going to lose your temper. However, if you raise your voice to us twice in a week, we're cutting your allowance in half."" ""Using curse words in this house will result in being grounded for the weekend, no excuses.""  , You might think that you’ll spend your entire day doling out punishments if you follow through with the repercussions every time your teenager acts up, but nobody said parenting was easy! If you apply punishments irregularly — letting them get away with behaviors sometimes and coming down on them at other times — you’re sending mixed messages and confusing your teenager. Teenagers are programmed to push boundaries, so the boundaries must be firm.   ""You know perfectly well that raising your voice twice in this house will get your allowance cut. Get your temper in check right now, or you know what's coming."" ""Promising not to talk back again doesn't change the fact that you just talked back to me. You know what the repercussions are for your behavior. It's on you to control yourself from the beginning.""  , If your child does something that should result in being grounded during prom, you might defer their grounding to the next weekend. After all, you want them to learn a lesson, not miss important life experiences. In general, though, don’t get into a habit of letting your teenager negotiate with you about normal repercussions. Wanting to go to the mall with their friends is not a special enough occasion to merit bending the ground rules for acceptable behavior.  , Simply grounding your teenager and letting them stew in their room will not necessarily improve their behavior. Some teenagers might actually enjoy the quiet time to laze around their room. Instead, use their punishment as an opportunity to instill life lessons. For example:   ""I understand that you're upset about not getting the video game you want, but you need to learn that there's a difference between what you earn and what you deserve. Everyone deserves a roof over their head, clothes on their backs, good in their stomachs, and love from their family — but not everyone has even that. We're going to volunteer together at a soup kitchen this weekend to get a sense of how much you have that should should be grateful for."" ""I don't think you understand how hurtful your words can be, so your punishment will be to write an essay on the history of slurs in this country. Prove to me that you understand the power of words."" ""I think you're having trouble communicating with me in a productive manner. I want you to write me a letter about how you feel about this, and spend some time getting it right using respectful language.""  , The privilege you remove will depend on your teen — consider what he or she values most, and will be most unwilling to give up in the future.   For example, you might take away your child's car, cell phone, laptop, television, etc. Set a clear deadline for when the privilege will be reinstated; reinstatement will be contingent on good behavior in the interim. Tell your child, ""The next time you act like this, you will lose this privilege for (x) days longer. The punishment will increase every time you act like this.""  , When your teen does something that makes you proud or makes your life easier — cleaning up the dishes without being asked, sticking up for a bullied classmate, etc. — be quicker with praise than you are with punishment when they disappoint you.   A heartfelt “thank you” with a hug and a kiss will make your teenager want to continue acting in ways that make them feel especially loved and appreciated. Sometimes, if your teenager is especially good about reacting well in a stressful situation or goes a long time without talking back, you might want to give them a special reward. Examples of positive rewards might include buying them something they want (a video game, for example), enrolling them in lessons they want (tennis, guitar, etc.), taking them on an outing (a sporting event), or allowing an outing they would not normally be allowed to participate in (going to a concert with friends)., Bribery can work well, but only if you put a lot of thought into the message you’re sending your child.   Don’t frame it as a bribe. For example, you might give your child a regular allowance that is withheld if they speak to you disrespectfully. That way, they don’t see it as a bribe for good behavior, but as a repercussion of bad behavior. Instead of training them to see aberrant good behavior as something that is rewarded from time to time, they’ll see aberrant bad behavior as something that is punished.  , Find ways to connect with your teenager about normal adolescent problems:   ""I remember how hard it was to stay awake in school when I was you age. Heck, I still have trouble staying awake at work now. But your grades are slipping, so let me share some of the tricks I use to make sure I have energy during the day."" ""There's nothing worse than feeling like you're friends are talking about you behind your back. Tell me how you're dealing with it.""  , If so, you’re leading them to believe that such behavior is acceptable. Children learn by imitating the behavior of those around them, and while you can’t always control the behavior of others around them (in school, on TV, etc.), you can control the behavior you’re modeling for them.  , Make family meals a priority.   Use that time to ask your child about what’s going well for them these days, and what’s upsetting them. This is a way to let them vent their frustrations in a way that actually builds up the bond between parent and child. Without regular conversations like this, you will only hear about their frustrations when they build up and explode into an argument.  , They say “it takes a village to raise a child,” and there’s a lot of truth in that statement. There are many other adults who come into contact with your children, and they’re probably being treated as poorly as you are by your teen. Reach out to them to coordinate an effort to create boundaries and enact discipline in a systematic way to curb your teenager’s attitude problem.   Set up a meeting with the school’s guidance counselor to discuss behavioral problems your child may be having at school and an action plan to curb such behavior. Speak to your child’s individual teachers, if possible. Work out a system of repercussions for back-talking that extends from home into the classroom, and across all of your child’s teachers. For example, you may ask the teachers to notify you of back-talking at school so you can discipline the child through extra chores, grounding, etc. at home. If your child spends a lot of time at a particular friend’s house, maintain regular communication with that friend’s parents. If you’re comfortable with their parenting style and capabilities, tell them they should feel free to discipline your child as they would their own for any bad behavior they witness in their home.  , Studies have shown that playing sports in a structured, team-oriented manner over a prolonged period of time does a lot more than simply keep kids in shape; it is also correlated with higher grades, a decrease in behavioral problems, and higher self-esteem. A team sport will also provide your teenager with a positive authority figure in the role of the coach; a good coach will promote healthy social behavior and provide emotional support that your teenager may simply be unwilling to turn to you for.Furthermore, the bond hopefully created between your child and their teammates will create a sense of belonging and pride — to both the team and the school — that is correlated with better focus and behavior.Choose a sport that your teenager actually enjoys; forcing your problem teen into something they actively dislike will likely not improve their behavior. Research the coach before allowing your child to join the team. Arrange a meeting to speak with them, and talk to the parents of other children on the team to make sure the coach’s goals for character development are in line with your own. Speak with the coach candidly about the problems you are having at home with your teenager, so they know what to expect and can formulate a plan for how to deal with these issues. Show interest in your child’s team involvement. Go to every game you can attend, and be a vocal supporter. Cheer your child on, and grieve with them when they lose.  , Even if you think the problems lie within your child alone, you, as a parent, must be willing to do some serious work if you want your child’s behavior to improve. FFT is recommended for the families of children of 11-18 year of age who demonstrate serious behavioral issues, including delinquency and violence. The therapy centers on five dimensions: engagement, motivation, relational assessment, behavior change and generalization.Engagement: FFT therapists develop a close relationship with all members of the family and are available to them to a far larger degree than non-FFT therapists. The therapist relationship is far more intimate than with other types of therapy. Motivation: the therapist will help redefine the difference between blame and responsibility — a line which often becomes blurry. The goal is to shift the family dynamic from one of blame to one of hope. Relational assessment: the therapist will provide an objective analysis of the dynamics between family members through observation and questioning. They will attempt to shift the perception of family problems from individual perspectives to a relationship perspective, in which family members see the connectedness of the family unit and how it functions together, rather than focusing on themselves as an isolated unit within a family structure. Behavior change: the therapist will equip your family with conflict resolution techniques and communication methods that will help you work through bad moods and family problems in a more constructive manner. Generalization: you will create a plan for how to extend what you have learned in the FFT sessions forward into your life beyond therapy. FFT generally involves 12-14 sessions conducted over the course of 3-5 months.  , Attachment theory posits that the relationship babies develop with their caregivers in the earliest years of life continues to affect their relationships and behaviors throughout their adolescent and adult lives.If you, as a parent, were unable to provide your child with a secure, nurturing environment in childhood, it’s unreasonable to expect them to work through their attachment issues on their own as adolescents, even if you are now a better parent to them than you were before.   ABFT sessions are usually an hour to 1 ½ hours long, and meet once a week. It begins with the question of “why do you (the child) not turn to your parents in times of crisis or need?” The therapist will meet with the members of your family both in a group context, and in individual sessions. Individual sessions will guide your teen through difficult memories from childhood that need to be addressed and dealt with for positive behavioral change. Sessions held with the parents alone will help parents work through attachment problems they might suffer from themselves, and how their issues are being revisited upon their children. Full family sessions will provide a safe space for you to be honest with each other and create a plan to improve family dynamics going forward.

For one, properties might be undeveloped, ""raw"" land without any planning or improvements performed by the current owner. However, develop-owned properties may be zoned or fully planned, with utilities and/or streets already in place. In addition, further properties might be already slated for construction, with existing plans for the buildings that will be constructed there. In general, less-developed land will be cheaper. However, this means that you'll have to organize utilities and work out zoning laws on your own as you develop the property.   Buying raw land will also require a large amount of due-diligence to make sure the land is surveyed properly, free of criminal activity (like drug growers or poaching), and to work out local regulations governing land use.Developers generally purchase large land sites for development. In most cases, the project is developed with streets and utilities, the sold to individual builders who then construct houses for sale or rent to home buyers or renters. As each stage of development is completed, the cost of the property generally increases.; , If the profits are so much better after construction, why sell earlier? Any time you buy something, it is a good idea to know why it is for sale. The reasons are often straightforward, but you want to make sure the builder isn’t concealing a fact about the property they discovered after breaking ground.   Builders sometimes need the money to complete their project on time. Selling preconstruction real estate gets them quick cash without having to worry about their credit or accruing interest on a loan. Other times, they may need to have outside investors like you to get approved for a loan., If you are interested in investing in a hot property in an up-and-coming neighborhood, this may not be as inexpensive as you thought. Why? Investors and 'flippers' who have been doing this to make extra money for years monitor housing markets for the most profitable preconstruction projects. However, on the bright side, competition from seasoned investors may indicate that the project is worthwhile.The competition will depend upon the size of a development and its use. For example, commercial developments for offices, apartments, and retail sites can be very expensive when compared to a single, undeveloped residential lot.  , The 2008 market crash burst every area of the housing bubble, including preconstruction real estate. As a result, builders are much more cautious about projects. While investors may get terms on large purchases, most sellers of single lots in a residential development require full payment.   By nature, preconstruction real estate requires you to do some speculation about the market value of the property not now, but after completion. However, keep in mind that you can't predict something cataclysmic like a housing market crash, which would likely mean that you lose your investment. You may have to choose between signing a contract that means losing a deposit if the builder has to pull the plug, and walking away. This is a big reason why preconstruction real estate is such a risky investment. Look for an experienced, reputable builder. The chances of a seasoned company calling off a construction problem are much lower than with a hot startup.As an investor, look for a builder that will contract your house or buy your lot to construct a house to sell. Generally, the lot market price will increase as the supply of vacant lots increase.  , Some realtors specialize in preconstruction real estate. They will assist you in setting up appointments with builders. If you are savvy enough with navigating real estate listings and contracts, you may be able to do this on your own. However, this is a cost-cutting measure that may not pay off in the long run., The less you pay for the property, the more your profit margin will be once the construction is complete. The first phase of selling is the cheapest. The downside is that it is much more difficult to determine if the construction will be completed in a timely manner, if at all., Before investing in a property, you'll need to be sure that it can be used for your intended purpose. Ask the selling agent about zoning restrictions and land use laws for the property to make sure that they mesh with your plans. Contact the city or county government if the agent seems unsure about any aspects of the zoning laws. Even if a neighboring property has a certain kind or extent of construction on it, this does not necessarily mean that your land can be used for the same purpose, so always check zoning laws carefully before proceeding with your investment.   If you're purchasing raw land, have the land re-surveyed to be sure about where your property line is., Real estate agents are working with you to find the best property. However, they get paid off commission, whether they close tomorrow or a year from now. Make sure they aren’t sugar coating the truth about a supposedly up-and-coming area. Do some internet searching and ask local businesses if the area is growing.  , Your real estate agent will want to close a deal with you as quickly as possible. You may only get a few days to make your decision. However, make it clear to them that you want to have a couple preconstruction real estate properties to choose from when the day comes for you to decide. This gives you a chance to weigh up-front costs versus long-term returns.  , The first 3-6 months of the pre-selling phase of preconstruction consists of the reservation stage. When you sign up for the project of interest you will a receive contract from the developer. If you are working with a consultant firm they will coordinate the delivery of the necessary paperwork.  , As an investor, you're purchasing a property with the intention of eventually selling or renting that property to an end-user. To get the best return on investment, you'll need to identify your ideal end-user and then focus your property choices and selling efforts on that end-user. End-users might be other investors, renters, homebuyers, or vacation renters. Before investing, make sure that there is a sizable local market of end-users for your property. Then, look at the supply of similar properties. If there are too few end-users or too many properties like yours, it may be difficult to sell the property down the road., Financing for investment properties can vary based on developer preferences and the attributes of the property. However, the average deal starts with a down payment of 5 or 10 percent of the purchase price. The balance, or a large portion of it, is then due upon completion of the property. Some investors choose to flip these properties before the total amount is due, betting on the fact that the property's value will have appreciated significantly before this point. Others pay for and hold the property until a buyer can be found a the appropriate price.In either case, you will need money for the down payment. This is usually paid for with the investor's own money, as obtaining a loan for investment purposes can be difficult. Purchasing raw land is slightly more expensive. For this type of transaction, you will typically need to be put about 25 percent down. Finding a lender may also be challenging. Try using a mortgage broker to locate an affordable land purchase loan., Work with the seller of the property to draft an agreement for the sale of the property. The agreement should include a timeline for building milestones with clauses that allow you to pull your investment or reduce the amount paid if these milestones are not met. This reduces your risk in the event that the property goes uncompleted or partially completed., You won’t have the option of selling your current home and moving into the new property yet. Unless your personal wealth is enough to cover the cost of the real estate, you will have to take out a loan. Though the cost of your current home will not be exactly the same as the new property, imagine doubling the amount you pay for housing each month.   If you do have enough money to cover the costs up front, think about the risk of losing your nest egg. Rainy day money is always good to have around, and you may think twice about risking it. The good news is that you may have paid off the home loan for the new property by the time construction is completed. This means you will be the property owner with no payments or strings attached.  , Tell them you are considering investing in preconstruction real estate in the next few months. You will likely need a loan, but you don’t have the specific numbers yet. They will walk you through the home loan process and hopefully give you an idea, or even an estimate, of the interest rates you would qualify for. You will be able to consider loans from other financial institutions when you actually buy the property, but this will help you know what rates you can expect. It will also give you more precise estimate of the cost of this investment.  , If you are doing this merely as an investment, look at financial periodicals for up-and-coming housing markets. You want to get in on a property whose value will rise. If you are buying preconstruction real estate instead as a place you will one day live, this is completely up to you. Keep in mind, however, that the area will not be the same after the construction project is complete, which may take several years.   Beachfront properties are an alluring buy, but factor in the added environmental dangers that would require an expensive insurance policy.  , Depending on the project you decide to buy in on, this chapter of your life may last several years. Do you have the stability for that kind of undertaking? Are you thinking about making major changes to your life in the meantime, such as having kids? Smart investments may be a way to make future life changes easier on you, but remember that unexpected developments may make you regret this expenditure.   Unfortunately, there isn't anything you can do to speed up the project. You can't strap on a hard hat and operate one of the cranes. You will need to accept that you are at the mercy of the builder's pace.  , A good way to determine the value of a property after the construction is complete is asking about the building materials. Unless you're an architect or an experienced realtor, you may not be aware of the relative advantages of certain materials. Talk with your real estate agent or another realty investment consultant. A basic internet search may give you an idea of the value of the material, but you should do more exhaustive research.If you are buying the property to eventually live in, look at the materials of your current home. If you like the materials your current home is made of, look for similar materials in the new property.  , This is a stipulation in the contract that entitles you to seeing the property in person. You can specify that you want to look through it now, before you sign the initial contract, or before you sign the final sales papers when construction is complete. You will need to be escorted by the builder, and probably wear a hard hat.For initial walk-throughs, this is a good way to look for drawbacks you don’t notice over the phone or looking at a map, such as strange smells, poor soil, road noise, etc. There may be little or no fee for backing out at this point. Final walk-throughs are a good way to spot construction flaws. Are the building materials actually what they described initially? Depending on the terms of your contract, you may have a bigger fee for backing out at this stage.  , The sales contract will be accompanied by a refundable deposit, usually 10% of the purchase price. The deposit is held in escrow with a selected title company and is fully refundable should you wish to cancel your reservation. The reservation stage of a project usually lasts until the project is at least 70% sold out.  , The reservation period can last anywhere from several days to 6 months. However, once the final contract is delivered, the buyer typically has 15 days to review the documents. At that point you can choose to commit to move forward or cancel. Have the experts make sure the contract is not exploitative in any way.  , After signing, you will be asked to provide roughly 20% of your purchase price or the balance of your earnest money. This balance should subtract your initial reservation deposit. It takes approximately 18-24 months after you submit your hard contract for construction and closing to be completed.  , At approximately 18-24 months after hard contract when the project is at or almost fully completed, you will be issued a Certificate of Occupancy (CO). At this point you are granted access to inspect your unit and create a list of any faults you find. If everything is satisfactory, you will go to closing. At closing you should have financial arrangements made regarding the balance of the unit or units. This is done by securing financing or having available cash or transferable assets.

Once the salesperson has rung your items or services through, they will ask you how you would like to pay. You should then present your debit card to the merchant for payment., Some merchants will need to take the card from you and swipe it through their machine for the transaction to process. Most merchants will have a separate point of sale (POS) machine that you will need to use to swipe your debit card.If your debit card has a chip on one side, you will need to insert your chip into the bottom gap in the POS machine for the transaction to process. Leave your debit card in the machine for the duration of the transaction. The machine will prompt you when to remove your card at the end of the transaction.  , Once you have swiped or inserted your debit card, you will be prompted by the machine to choose the “Credit” or “Debit” option. You will need to select the “Debit” option to use your debit card for payment.   Some merchants are able to select the “Debit” option through their system so you may not see this option in the POS machine. You may instead be prompted to move on to accepting the transaction.  , The POS machine may ask you to approve the transaction to ensure the total amount you are being charged is correct. Take a moment to confirm that the amount on the POS machine is the amount you should be charged.   For example, if you were purchasing items for $35.52, the POS machine may ask, “Do you accept the amount of $35.52?” If the amount looks correct, you would then choose the approve button on the POS machine.  , Some POS machines will ask you to select the bank account you would like to use for the transaction. You will have two options: “Checkings” or “Savings” account. You should choose the bank account that has the money you would like to use to pay for the transaction.   If you do not have a “Savings” account set up through your banking institution for your debit card, you may not be shown this option.  , The POS machine will then ask you to enter your four digit Personal Identification Number (PIN). You should have a PIN set up for your debit card through your bank.Make sure you enter your PIN correctly into the keypad, as the transaction may be cancelled if you enter it incorrectly. You should use your hand to cover the screen and keypad as you input your PIN so it cannot be seen by others. Keep in mind some banking institutions will charge a fee of 0.50 cents to $1 for using your PIN at the register. You can avoid this fee by selecting the “credit” option, if you have a debit/credit card. You will then use the debit card like a credit card and sign for the transaction instead of putting in your PIN., At some retailers, you may be taken to a cashback screen on the POS machine. The cashback option will allow you to take cash out of your bank account as part of the debit transaction. This can be handy if you need cash on hand. You may be asked if you would like to take cash out in even denominations of $20, $40, $60, $80, and $100.Keep in mind some retailers may charge a small fee for giving you cashback. Always ask the retailer if there are any fees before you use the cashback option.  , Once you have entered your PIN, the POS machine will process the transaction. Your bank will be triggered to take out money from your account to pay for the transaction. If you have enough money in your chosen bank account for the transaction, you will see an “Approval” notice.   If the transaction is approved, the POS machine will produce a receipt for the vendor or seller. You can also get a copy of your receipt for your records. If the transaction does not go through due to insufficient funds in your account or you end up cancelling the transaction for some reason, you will get a “Not Approved” or “Incomplete” notice. You will then need to pay for the transaction with another form of payment or not make the purchase.  , You should check your account balance before you use your debit card. This will ensure your transactions go through, leading to less embarrassment at checkout. Making sure you have enough money in your account for your purchases will also ensure your bank does not charge you an overdraft fee if you try to take out more money than you have in your account.Depending on your bank, you may have the option of overdrawing your account within a certain amount for a fee. Or, your bank may not allow you to overdraw your account at all and will simply decline the transaction if you try to spend more money than you have. Your bank may give you the option to set up alerts through online banking to let you know when your balance is low. This way, you can check your account more frequently and be aware of how much money you have to spend in your account.  , You should be well aware of the fees you may be charged when you use your debit card. This will prevent you from getting a small shock when you open your monthly bank statement to find a series of debit card usage fees. You should get a full list of the fees associated with your debit card from your bank so you can use your debit card wisely.Your bank may charge you a fee for entering your PIN to complete a transaction rather than signing your name. You may also be charged if you overdraw your account using your debit card. This is similar to what happens when you write a check that “bounces” or does not go through. You may be charged a small fee if you use an ATM machine that is not operated by your financial institution. These fees are usually around $2-$4 per a transaction.  , In some cases, a merchant may put a “hold” on your transaction, where they will get approval from your bank for an estimated purchase amount. Once they get approval for the estimated purchase amount, you will be charged. This “hold” may take 24-48 hours, so you may not have access to held money in your bank account during this time. You should try to keep track of your held transactions throughout the day so you do not try to use money that is being held in your account.Many merchants use “holds” to make sure you have enough funds to pay for a purchase. Often, your debit account may be held when you reserve a hotel room using your debit card, or when you use your debit card to pay for gas at the gas station. For example, once you make a gas payment at the pump, the gas station will create two transactions. The first transaction will be to get approval from your bank for an estimated purchase amount. The second will be for the actual amount of the purchase. The first transaction must go through and be cancelled by your bank within 48 hours for the hold on that amount to be lifted from your account. Then, the second transaction will be processed.  , You should always be wary when using ATMs to take out cash with your debit card, as the ATM may be “skimmed” by a thief. Skimming is used to capture your bank card information by putting a reader on the POS machine or the ATM card slot. You should go for ATMs that located in well lit, high traffic areas, such as a shopping center or a busy plaza. You should avoid ATMs that look damaged or where the card slot looks askew and tampered with.It may also be safer, and more cost efficient, to use ATMs provided by your banking institution. You should be able to use ATMs at your banking institution free of charge to take out cash. Often ATMs at your bank are well maintained and secured from theft or fraud.  , You should always protect your personal banking information so it is not at risk of theft or fraud. Do not write down your PIN on your debit card or on a piece of paper. Try to memorize it in your head. You should never share your debit card PIN, your security code, or any other account information with others, in person or online.You should also only give out your bank account information over the phone or online to individuals that you know well and trust. Do not give out this information to strangers as this could lead to theft, fraud, or a scam. Your bank will only ask you for your bank account information over the phone or in person. You should be suspicious of email or text messages from your “bank” requesting personal banking information.  , If you lose your debit card or it is stolen, you should let your bank know as soon as possible. By law, any theft or fraud on your card cannot cost you more than $50 as long as you notify your bank within 48 hours.Your bank will likely put a hold on your card and conduct an investigation into the theft or fraud.

Some programs are focused strictly on nutrition, whereas others offer specializations or combine the topic with other areas like exercise physiology or public health., After you’ve researched a wide variety of programs, you should begin the process of narrowing down your list and selecting a few different ones. You should narrow down your list to programs that best suit your needs and desires. Make sure to:   Consider the cost of enrollment as well as any potential monetary assistance from the university. The average cost of tuition per year is between $20,000 and $25,000. Consider the physical location and the region of the program. Consider job placement rates from graduates of the program. Job placement often corresponds with a given program's ranking. Top ranking programs that offer a PhD in nutrition include the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Tufts University, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Consider the faculty and the advisor you may be working with when narrowing down programs. Focus on at least 3 to 5 programs., Now that you’ve selected a few potential programs to focus on, you need to review the application requirements of each program. This is important, as you’ll need to figure out all of the documents you’ll need to submit in with each application. Requirements typically include:   A bachelor's or master's degree. High scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). A resume. A personal statement. Letters of recommendation. Note the the application deadline due date for enrolling in the next school year or semester., When applying to the programs you’ve selected, make sure to fill out the complete application. Filling out the application on time in full will make sure your application process goes smoothly and that you are considered by the program’s admissions board.   You will have to provide specific personal information such as your social security number, date of birth, and other identifying information. You will have to provide all relevant academic information such as dates of graduation, grade point averages, and more. You will probably have to write in your GRE and/or SAT scores, so have those handy. Write legibly, in black ink. If you can, fill out the application on your computer. This will make sure that academic advisor assessing your application will be able to read your application., Universities generally request a resume along with the application to examine your prior academic training and work experience in the field of nutrition. Based on your background, conclusions are made about your ability to make a positive contribution to the nutrition field.   Include a professional summary at the top of your C.V. Your professional summary should give an idea of your focus in the field of nutrition as well as your experience. Outline your professional experience in the field of nutrition. This can range from internships to full-time jobs. List your educational background. This should include all degrees awarded and should show relevant coursework in the field of nutrition. Show any publications you might have. Publications in journals like Current Developments in Nutrition or The Journal of Nutrition will demonstrate your commitment and leadership in the field., The purpose of this statement is to understand and state your professional goals, academic and professional background, your reason for choosing the specific program, and how you see yourself contributing to the nutrition field. Read the application instructions carefully as each program specifies a different content and length requirement.   Address your interest and dedication to the field of nutrition. If you have an interest in a certain aspect of the field, like nutrition in developing countries, state it. If you already know what your research and dissertation work will focus on, explain it. In addition, if you know your research question, pose it. For instance, ""What are the long-term health implications of vitamin C deficiency in East Africa?""  , There is a very good chance that the program will require you to provide several letters of recommendation. These letters are intended to provide the program admissions panel with more information about your character and work ethic.   Be prepared to provide at least three letters of recommendation from academics or professionals familiar with your work or merit. Request such letters from employers, professors and colleagues who are closely familiar with your capabilities, performance and significant accomplishments. Personal references from family members or friends are sometimes permitted, depending on the program., After you’ve gathered all of the application materials, make sure to submit it. Submitting it on time and to the appropriate program representative is extremely important in making sure you will be considered for the program.  , A PhD in nutrition requires you to complete a certain number of graduate courses on related subjects. Nutrition coursework is intended to provide you with all of the basics of nutrition and to give you the tools required to help you become an expert in your subfield.   A PhD program in nutrition usually requires completion of courses in vitamins and minerals, fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Other courses focus on research methods, nutritional epidemiology and nutritional assessments. Consult the program guide for specifics concerning required and elective courses. Graduate coursework for your Ph.D. will take between 2 and 4 years to complete. , After you’ve completed graduate course work, you’ll need to take your doctoral qualifying exams. These exams will test you on all of the information you’ve learned in your course work. They are the final step before you begin work on your dissertation.   Qualifying exams vary from program to program. Talk to the program advisor before enrolling. Your qualifying exams will most likely be scored on a pass or fail basis. Qualifying exams are extremely involved and usually take place over a week or longer. Depending on the program, you might test for 6 or 8 hours a day for 6 to 8 days., Deciding on your research top is perhaps one of the most important decisions you'll make in graduate school. This decision will not only dictate the focus of your research and your academic life for the next year or two, but it will help establish you in a subfield within the broader field.   Your topic and/or research question should be original and should make a new addition to the profession. Your research topic should also be feasible given your time and financial capabilities. Your research problem can be on a wide variety of topics, including human health and nutrition, animal nutrition, and even the economics and politics of food consumption. Very often, you'll narrow down research questions and specific topics with the help of your academic advisor -- a faculty member who serves as a mentor., Conducting your research is often one of the most exciting and interesting parts of your doctoral studies. During this phase of your PhD studies, you'll conduct studies and/or gather evidence to support the thesis of your dissertation.   Depending on your focus, subfield, and research question, you may be required to conduct a study and work with people on a nutrition-related problem that you have picked. Potential studies could include looking at what people from different socio-economic or regional groups consume, the impact of popular foods on human health, or more. Depending on your focus, you may compile statistics and work with previously-existing studies. The research phase of your program may take up to two years., The culmination of your coursework, work with an academic advisor, and your research will be your dissertation. Writing your dissertation is a prolonged process and will serve as the final achievement of your graduate studies.   The length of dissertations vary, depending on program. Most often, though, dissertations will be from 150 pages to 250 pages. Typically, you will be required to defend your dissertation before a panel of faculty. The amount of time needed to write your dissertation will vary. It could take between 1 and 3 years, depending on your research.",1869,"['c.v.', 'degree', 'request letters', 'science-related field', 'recommendation', 'question', 'degree program', 'application packet', 'materials', 'research topic', 'exams', 'curriculum vitae', 'personal statement', 'research various university programs', 'gre', 'master', 'program', 'application requirements', 'dissertation', 'select several doctoral programs', 'application', 'graduate coursework', 'research', 'nutrition', 'bachelor', 'phd', 'graduate record examination']"
"['search for templates or samples', 'use the appropriate title', 'create section headings', 'use clear and attractive formatting', 'write in an active', 'personal style', 'establish what the warranty does and does not cover', 'define the period of time the warranty covers', 'explain the remedy offered under the warranty', 'outline the process for getting warranty service', 'address how state law affects customer rights', 'list any additional customer obligations', 'disclose any restrictions or circumstances that will void the warranty', 'describe any alternate dispute resolution (adr) requirements']",How to Draft a Limited Warranty," You may be able to find templates or samples of limited warranties online that you can use as guides. You also should look at the limited warranties for several other businesses in your industry to get a good understanding of the language typically used.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issues rules and regulations to ensure warranties comply with federal law. The agency also publishes a manual on its website to help businesses draft acceptable warranties. Legal document companies offer templates for a small fee, but you can easily draft your own simply by taking a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the FTC's guidelines. However, you can use templates to decide how you want to organize your document or choose a style that you prefer.; , Your document should begin with a title that clearly describes the type of warranty you are offering. The title must designate the warranty either as ""full"" or ""limited"" to be in compliance with federal law.To have a full warranty, you must provide warranty service free of charge to anyone who owns the product without requiring customers to return a warranty card or register their product first. A full warranty also offers the customer the choice of a full refund or replacement if the product is unable to be repaired. Any other warranty is a limited warranty, and this should be explicitly stated. Your title also must contain any other essential information. Include the item or parts included in the warranty's coverage and the duration of the warranty, if possible, in the title. For example, your title might be ""Limited Lifetime Warranty on the Way-Good Widget."" In some cases, parts of your product may be covered by a full warranty, but the product as a whole is only covered by a limited warranty. The FTC classifies these as multiple warranties, and they must adhere to additional guidelines meant to ensure customers understand how the different warranties work with each other.  , Headings that clearly describe the information contained in each section allow you to break up the text and make specific information easy for customers to find quickly. Use parallel construction so the headings flow smoothly together.Make headings that are specific about what is covered in the section, rather than using vague, general headings such as ""Service"" or ""Conditions."" One method is to phrase your headings as questions, and then answer the question in the section. Think of the heading as a question a customer might ask, and how you would answer. In some cases, your warranty will be more readable if you break lengthier sections into multiple parts. Try to have each section heading apply to only one fact or term of the warranty. Make sure your heading structure matches the text in your section. Read through the entire document when you're done and make sure the section text follows from the heading. For example, if you're using questions as headings, the section text beneath should provide a direct answer to the question.  , Most people are intimidated by thick blocks of text in small fonts that cover the page. Use a clean font in a reasonable size and arrange short sentences with plenty of paragraph breaks and white space.Choose a font that is easily legible, keeping in mind that the document itself may be folded, creased, or copied. Your font should remain clear and legible even if the paper is damaged. Make sure you set enough space between the lines that the text doesn't look crowded on the page and the lines don't overlap each other. Consider using boldface and italics for emphasis rather than all-capitals, which can be difficult to read (and often is interpreted as shouting). Resist the urge to justify your text. Justified text often is more difficult to read than ragged right margins, and can cause awkward spacing problems.  , Keep your sentences short and straightforward. Active sentences (subject-verb-object) are more readable than passive writing with ""to be"" verbs that leave the actor out of the equation.For example, if you write ""Your purchase price will be refunded ..."" you leave the customer wondering who exactly will refund his or her money. ""We will refund your full purchase price"" leaves no room for confusion. Throughout your warranty, use short, simple sentences to describe the terms in plain English. Avoid vague or overly complex words and legalese. Personal style identifies the parties to the document and allows you to speak directly to the customer. Just make sure you define the pronouns the first time you use them. For example, you might write ""We (Way-Good Widget Corp.) will repair or replace, at our discretion, defective or malfunctioning widgets."" If you mean to write a requirement, use ""must"" instead of ""should."" The word ""should"" typically indicates some ideal preference, while the word ""must"" tells your customers the action is required.  , The first couple of sections of your limited warranty should break down the circumstances and situations under which the customer is entitled to warranty service, and any scenarios not covered by the warranty.If your limited warranty doesn't cover any and all defects or malfunctions in your product (and most don't), you must list specifically what it does cover. As far as what it doesn't cover, use this section to list exceptions that common sense might dictate would be included under the warranty, but which are not. For example, if you manufacture electronics, you may want to list that your warranty does not cover water damage. Use bullet-point lists for related items, rather than writing the series out in a sentence. This emphasizes the functionality of your document and makes it easier for customers to find the information they're looking for. This can be especially helpful in the sections describing what the warranty does and does not cover. Using parallel construction enables customers to easily read through and compare the lists. For a multiple warranty, consider using a chart to show at a glance what is covered by which warranty and how long that coverage lasts. Keep in mind that your customers may not necessarily be experts in your industry. If you need to use a technical word that may be unfamiliar, define it immediately after you use it.  , Even if you included the warranty's term in the title, include a separate section that states how long the warranty lasts, including the date on which it starts.In some circumstances, the warranty may begin on a different date than the purchase date, or after a specific event occurs. If this is your intent, state it clearly in the warranty document. The default understanding is that warranty coverage begins on the date of purchase. You also must state whether the warranty only covers the purchaser, or follows the product to a subsequent owner. Keep in mind that you can't really call it a ""lifetime"" warranty if it only lasts as long as the original purchaser continues to own the product.  , Write a separate section describing what you will do when the customer files a warranty claim. If attempts will be made to repair the product before a refund or replacement is offered, this is where you'll describe that process.For example, you might write that you will repair or replace defective products, at your discretion. If you offer to repair, you may want to include limitations on the types of repairs that will be attempted before the product is simply replaced. If a refund is offered, you may need to go into detail regarding how that refund will be paid, and whether proof of purchase price is required. If you only offer refunds in the form of a credit at your business toward future purchases, state this clearly. This section may require you to list what you won't do. For example, warranty service may be free, but may not include labor costs. Anything the customer must pay for should be stated explicitly.  , Customers must understand what they need to do if they want to file a warranty claim, and what to expect when they elect to proceed under the limited warranty to repair or replace the product.If you have a specific phone number the customer must call, or address to which they must write, provide this information here. You may want to put the phone number in boldface type, or put a text box around the contact information so it's easy for customers to find in the event they need it. If you allow other stores or companies to provide warranty service for your product, let customers know which stores are approved to service the product and where they can be found.  , The laws in some states prohibit businesses from disclaiming or limiting certain implied warranties or liability for some damages. If you've included any of these limitations, you must include a statement that your disclaimers or limitations may be prohibited by state law.It isn't necessary to research warranty laws of all the states in which your product is sold. You can simply write a boilerplate statement such as ""This warranty gives you specific legal rights, but you may have other rights provided by your state's law."" You also can include a statement to the effect that any statements in your warranty are void where prohibited by state law, but without affecting the rest of the warranty. This section may include legal terms that you can't just change into ordinary words, such as ""implied warranty."" Add a brief description of the term in parentheses immediately after the term so your customers understand it.  , General requirements customers must fulfill to avail themselves of service under the warranty should be explicitly stated. Federal law prohibits any hidden requirements.For example, if customers can only avail themselves of warranty service if they previously filled out and mailed in a warranty registration card, this should be listed in your warranty document. You also might want to include on any warranty registration card whether registration is required to use the warranty. Many limited warranties include other requirements that are designed to prevent customers from getting free repairs of products that are stolen, or that they tried and failed to repair themselves. These requirements typically include intact serial numbers and unbroken tamper seals.  , Although related to the early sections stating things the warranty doesn't cover, this section refers to specific circumstances in which the warranty is voided, regardless of what is wrong with the product.For example, many warranties on electronics have clauses stating that the warranty is voided if the customer opens the case. This requirement voids the warranty in its entirety, regardless of whether the customer did anything to the components after opening the case. Some warranties also don't apply if the product was damaged by a natural disaster or other catastrophe such as flood or fire. In other contracts, this clause is known as a ""force majeure"" clause, and excuses performance if an ""Act of God"" intervenes. It works the same way with warranties.  , If you want disputes under the warranty handled through mediation or arbitration rather than by filing a lawsuit in court, include a section outlining these requirements.This is another section that may require legal terms that are foreign to customers. Try to explain concepts such as damages as simply as you can, using parenthetical explanations where necessary. If you want to include an ADR clause, it must comply with the FTC's dispute resolution rule. Include a statement that customers can sue rather than using the ADR mechanism you've described if they want.  Your ADR clause merely states a preference to have disputes resolved through more informal proceedings.

Learn from what others see. This can help decide which rides and attractions will take priority during your visit.  Recognize that there are few other real theme park options near Winter Haven, FL (in or near Orlando, FL) with Universal Orlando and Sea World Orlando nearby, #* Recognize the sections of the park that exist here. When you first walk through the gates, you'll enter into several different areas called ""The Beginning"" and DUPLO Village, Fun Town, Pirates Cove, Land of Adventure, Imagination Zone, Lego City, Lego Technic, Lego Kingdoms, World of Chima and this all happens around one final great big land around a final pond in the center in an area many know called Miniland. There is also a separate area for the Water Park that is on site that LEGOLAND calls Water Park on their park map   , The address to this park is located at 1 LEGOLAND Way, Winter Haven, FL33884 The cost to park your car at Legoland will run you about $17 for cars and upwards from there (depending on complexity of vehicle). , The park contains a total of 12 lands each placed in a circular pattern following a short walk in from the entry area. Their lands here are called The Beginning, Heartlake City, Miniland, Lego Technic, Pirates Cove, Imagination Zone, Lego City, Land of Adventure, Lego Kingdoms, Duplo Valley and Fun Town along with 3 other special lands called World of Chima, Cypress Gardens and the LEGOLAND Water Park. , This colorful section consists of mostly guest service locations (wheelchair rental, First Aid and the like), shopping and a few quick-service dining options and one ride., The ride doesn't take too long, but it will give you a general perspective of everything you can do in the park later on once you arrive at the entrance gate to the attraction.  , This area is known as Heartlake City. Heartlake City is LEGOLAND Florida's newest land that was unveiled in May-June 2015, Although it first premiered in June 2015, it seems like a pure winner for a little fun for the older aged crew. It seems to be a little wild for the younger crew, but everyone is strapped in tight onto these horse-themed seats.,,, It is this famous, thanks to the creations that are created here. These creations make them famous and help portray the LEGO image on their guests who play at the park.   Look at all the minute details of each LEGO block item that has been constructed. Each item has so much detail - and it was all made to be so...realistic.  ,,,, You'll see many of the famous sites of Washington DC shown in LEGO blocks including the White House (including the president and his pet dog, Bo) and Capitol, the Washington Monument, Jefferson Memorial as well as some of the Smithsonian National Mall all carved in Lego blocks.  , Look at the intricate detail of the New York skyline with it's Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building, Times Square and many other places in this section that are devoted to New York (City).  , This section houses such items as the Naboo, Genosis, Kashyyk & Mustafar, Tatooine, Hoth, an Endor village, and the Christophea (from the Clone Wars).  ,, Although still quite small, it'll pack a pretty punch and shows what the LEGO designers really can do when given time to create on and near water.  , This section contains such LEGO figures as Key West's Mallory Square section and some of the famous war mansions from the panhandle to Central Florida's Bok Tower.  ,, This attraction, though themed as being in the LEGO Technic style, is actually nothing like a LEGO Technic complexity and is full-blown metal on metal!, This power ski-like ride is positioned around a small moat as you dodge water blasts from water blasters positioned on the outside of the moat looking in. Be careful though- as on this ride, you'll be standing on the wave runner the entire time.  , Although Technicycle is much like the Dumbo rides in the Disney Parks, the LEGOLAND Technicycle ride is unique in that it looks like a Lego block with bicycle-like propulsion features that allow it's rider to move the vehicle up and down (at will) in the shaft.  , With the exception of the sides of some of the buildings here and the music sections playing overhead, there isn't much to see here. You can find a ski show in the Water Ski Show in the Pirates Cove Live Water Ski Show venue or pick a drier show in the Special Events Venue (when used) and watch that show instead. But this section is rather uninteresting to most people at this time.  , Although there is a minimum height requirement, this fun attraction can be ridden by many, and can be fun to teach your children what happens during a freefall event all while keeping the guest safe. The freefall towers are colorful and fun to look at. Many kids adore the ride towers and the colors tend to draw the kids eyes quite quickly as you reach into this area of the park.,, With several games inside (in the style of some new gaming systems), there's no way that no one can find something they don't like., For many, you'll need to make special reservations at the building inside the Imagination Zone area.However, careful; as this attraction isn't open long to suit school hours nearby. It is open from 10am till 2pm Eastern Time., Also, again, this attraction also tries to suit school hours nearby (10am til 2pm Eastern Time)., Even if you are an experienced boater and can deal with not having a propulsion system that isn't generated by the park at the entrance to the ride, this can really cut you a small break.  ,, Much like that of the Tommorrowland Speedway in Walt Disney World in Florida or Autopia in Disneyland in California, this will have you and your kids driving these LEGOLAND cars around like a pro.   If your kids aren't up to driving cars yet, walk up to the Ford Jr(Junior) Driving School instead. There, they don't even have to worry about driving, and can be left up to sit in the car and watch it move around a circular track by themselves, looking at all the other LEGO stuff nearby. Ford Jr Driving School is by far the first building you come to of the two Driving School items, but adults can watch their children ride.        ,, You'll feel like you really are flying in a hang-glider under more extreme g forces around some tight curves and corners. No helixes exist on this ride however,so don't worry about that.  , The Jeeps they ride in for this safari will have your kids laughing. They will see several cute bricked animals made completely of Lego/DUPLO blocks as they ride around a track for a few minutes.  , Although short, the ride operators will send it's guests around this out-and-back coaster track twice before returning to the station to debunk it's guests.  , This super-mild attraction will leave your kids jumpy for a few minutes and want to make them become more like the beetle that all kids think they are. This ride raises them about 15 feet in the air, then bounces them back to earth rather gently.  , Although not fast, most people find it rather interesting to see all the LEGO creations here. Each room tells it's own story, so explore each room as the ride unfurls.  , This area will keep your kids thrilled that they've enticed some pharaohs. The only LEGO creations you'll see are in the queue for the attraction on the outside, so don't worry if the kids think it will be scary when you mention about what a pharaoh is and what could happen (what could happen, won't happen); most kids come out happy and some even come out laughing, having learned a little about the pharaoh lifestyle in a ""fun"" way.,, This attraction can be amusing to the parents, but it is especially meant for the children.  ,, This part-roller coaster and part-LEGO looking attraction will leave you baffled before you even realize the roller coaster segment even started. Out of the starting gate, this attraction doesn't accelerate much, but does show you a few LEGO items that have been constructed and is indoors. But then things get wild - the ride then becomes the roller coaster everyone fears. It features several corkscrew turns at a moderate intensity level, it doesn't get much beyond that.  , Whether it's building with DUPLO blocks or sliding down a rather colorful slide or something the youngest children will adore, this area can keep these small kids active and yet enthused., With all the water games happening here, it'll be hard to steer your children away from all this fun watery areas.,, This super-slow moving train will bring your children on a ride that will make them think they've taken a real train ride through the countryside - only to find out that the residents of this countryside are DUPLO block residents who don't particularly move a whole lot - if at all!, This active play area will keep your kids amused and active for a little while.,, Fun Town doesn't have too many rides, but what rides it does have, it really tries to excel at., You will be able to see LEGO bricks being made in front of your eyes in action.  , Ride a larger LEGO-looking horse on a carousel wheel on this double-decker carousel. This Carousel is one of the few Carousels that exist inside a LEGOLAND park.  , With three movie types - from a Movie called LEGO Legends of Chima, to a Clutch Powers 4D Adventure to even a Spellbreaker 4D movie, these 12 minute shows will excite all who come to visit this building., You will be able to play in the water area called ""Cragger's Swamp"" or shoot water out of a small water cannon at a bird-looking ornament in ""The Quest for CHI"" or run a Speedorz Lego-action figure through an obstacle course. Having only been opened in 2014, this area might be small, but it will eventually grow to become a viable playing area - but for now, we'll just have to wait and see to what it becomes at a more smaller scale.  , Whether it's sailing down a lazy river in a raft (filled with water and several LEGO blocks) or it's playing in other water-areas onsite in this land, this area can meet most guests expectations. However, be prepared to bring some water clothes (bathing suit) underneath regular day clothes to play in this area of the park.  , It might be a far cry from what it was pre-LEGOLAND days, but with Legoland's thought of bringing back a park that was here after people's cries were heard by the management team, there is now a Cypress Gardens area of the park where you can sit back and relax or stroll around and calm down from the rest of the park's excitement.

Sciences, social sciences, and humanities are all beneficial to those wishing to enter the criminal justice field. Sciences can help when you're analyzing a crime scene, while social sciences help you to analyze the mind of someone you're interviewing. Humanities gives you the background you need to put what's happening in the criminal justice world in context., Critical thinking skills involve being able to interpret, analyze, reason, and evaluate. One way you can begin to develop critical thinking skills is to learn to back up your arguments.For instance, say you want to take a stance on a hot-button issue, such as a flat tax rate or abortion. Don't just make up your mind based on what others have told you. Research the issue, and look at both sides. Pick resources that look at both sides of the issue without making a judgement. Once you've gathered your information, take a stance; you may even find that both sides have merit, and you don't want to pick a side. Now you're able to back up that stance based on what you've gathered. You can also learn to think critically if you analyze while you're reading. Look for what assumptions the author is basing his or her writing on. Constantly question the assumptions that are made to see if they are valid. For instance, say you're reading an article online that draws conclusions about two things because they happened at the same time, such as the rise in eating aspartame being connected to a rise in brain tumors. While it's possible that the two are linked, the rise in brain tumors could have been caused by a number of other factors.If you're in school, your teachers should be helping you to learn how to think critically. You can help by taking more advanced classes that are more on-par with college courses.  , Many people take computer literacy for granted these days. However, if you haven't kept up with computers as much as you should, take some time to learn. So much of the professions in criminal justice these days are done primarily on the computer that you must learn. Most libraries offer basic classes, and you can always take a class at a community college to increase your skill., You need to be able to talk to people to find out information or to speak to a group of people about a case. Public speaking classes can help you with the second part of that.You also need to know how to read people. When you're talking to witnesses and suspects, you need to be able to interpret body language; maybe they're saying one thing with their mouths, but their body language is saying they aren't being entirely truthful. Psychology classes can help you with body language, but you can also learn to read body language by observing people more closely. When you're out in public, watch how people use their bodies to communicate things that they aren't saying., While this isn't an absolute necessary for all criminal justice jobs, you do need to be physically able to do the job in fields such as law enforcement.Develop a regimen of aerobic exercise, flexibility-increasing exercise, and strength training to get in the shape you need to be. If you're not sure where to get started, join a local gym and take advantage of their classes.  , You can use a database specifically designed for this purpose. For instance, Big Future by The College Board is one option. You have a number of choices to make when deciding on a school.For instance, you'll need to decide whether you want to go to a big public university, a smaller private school, or a community college. Big public universities are cheaper in state than private school, but classes will also be a lot bigger at the public schools. Community colleges are cheap and generally smaller, but you can usually only get an associate's degree, not a bachelor's degree.Decide if you want to go big or small. Even though public universities tend to be bigger than private, that's not always the case. Decide if you want a large, medium, or small school. You'll get more personal attention at a smaller school, but you'll have more opportunities to get involved at a bigger school.You'll also be able to sort by other factors, if they're important to you. For example, you can narrow by how selective a school is, what sports they provide, or how diverse the school is., Most traditional schools, such as state schools and private schools, are nonprofit, meaning the goal is not to make a profit. However, today, many for-profit universities are available, such as Kaplan University, University of Phoenix, and DeVry University. One good thing about for-profits is they offer more flexible options for students, often having more night and weekend classes.Many non-profit universities are accredited by the same organizations as non-profits. For instance, University of Phoenix is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.However, some for-profits are not accredited, which takes some of the credibility away from your degree.In addition, some employers do not view for-profit degrees in as favorable a light as nonprofit universities. For-profit universities often cost more than comparable nonprofit schools.For-profits tend to spend less per student on instruction and have substantially lower graduation rates.Nonprofits often have more ""extras"" than for-profits, such as extensive libraries, gyms, and campuses; many for-profits use office buildings for classrooms., Online will offer you more flexibility.However, you may get more out of the experience in person, since you will be able to interact with other students and the professors more without the filter of the internet.  , That is, your top choice may be a long shot, and that's fine. However, you also need to apply to schools that you are more likely to get into. You don't want to miss out on going to school just because you only applied to one or two schools.  , Each school will offer specializations in your field. Decide what's important to you, as that can affect your choice of schools. For instance, Penn State offers a minor in Homeland Security, which could be helpful if you want to go into protective services on the national level., For each school, the application will be a little different. However, you'll always need things like biographical information, your social security, and your GPA.You'll also need a high school transcript, which your school should provide for you.Most schools require letters of recommendation. It's best to ask early. You can ask teachers, coaches, pastors, mentors, or any other non-family adult who knows you well. You'll also need to write an essay or personal statement. This statement should represent who you are to the college admissions people and why you want to be in this field. Convince them that you belong at the school., Most schools require either the SAT or ACT. Some schools will make you take one or the other, but most will accept either one. Your high school or local library likely has classes available to help you prep for these tests; if not, both tests have websites that provide you with study materials, or you can purchase a study guide in a book form. Most books come with a way to take practice tests online, so that you can practice. If you don't do well, you can retake the exams, but be aware it costs each time., Though it may not be all that beneficial to apply early, it does benefit you to start early. Applications will take longer than you think, so you should leave yourself as much time as possible to finish them.  , Some schools allow you to use what's known as the common application. Essentially, this application is one that you can fill out once and use at as many as 525 schools. Check to see if the schools you're applying to accept this application., It can take awhile to be accepted. In fact, most schools will push it to their final deadline, usually in March or April. You'll likely need to make a decision by early May., At almost any school you go to, you'll need to complete some general education courses, which include classes like composition, western literature, government, economics, and American history. Most of the time, you'll spend at least your first year only doing general education, although you may also start an introduction to criminal justice.Often, you'll get to decide what to take when. However, some schools prescribe exactly what you will take each year with little wiggle room., Most schools have specific courses you must take in your field. For instance, at Penn State, you'll need to take courses such as Criminology, Introduction to Criminal Justice, Policing in America, and Corrections in America., You will be required to take more classes in your field, beyond the ones that are exactly prescribed. In other words, you'll be required to round out your major with classes you are interested in, allowing you to focus on what you want to do even if you don't pick a specialization or your school doesn't offer them. For instance, if you're interested in environmental crimes, you could choose a few classes focused in that area rather than corporate crimes., Most universities also allow you so many hours to take extra classes on whatever you want, in your major or not. You can take classes just for your enjoyment, such as guitar or art. However, you can also use the time to take more major classes or to take classes outside of your major that would benefit you, such as psychology or philosophy classes., You may struggle at first to maintain good grades, but as you shift into the college environment, you should begin to adapt. You'll need to learn good study habits to stay on top of your work. For instance, it's essential to make out a schedule of all the work you have ahead for the semester so you know exactly what you need to do.Try to enjoy what you are studying. It makes a big difference in how much you take in. Always try to find something interesting in everything you're studying.Use what you have. That is, don't be afraid to make up memory games to help you remember what you need to know. You can put what you're studying to song or make crazy acronyms. Also, you can also make study groups to discuss the material and quiz each other.When you're studying, focus on studying. Pick a quiet place where you can weed out distractions, and only have around you what you need to study. Put your phone and any other distractions away.Take good notes in class. One of the best ways to learn the material is to take notes while your professor is talking, as she will likely point out what's most important. Don't try to take down every word; stick to making an outline.  , Once you've put in all the hard work, it's time to graduate from your program. At most schools, you must apply for graduation. The registrar's office will review your transcript to make sure you've completed all the necessary coursework. Usually, you must pay a fee to apply.",1958,"['online degree', 'information', 'list', 'computer literate', 'class', 'electives', 'acceptance', 'range', 'general education courses', 'common application', 'criminal justice courses', 'gpa', 'schools', 'for-profit schools', 'field', 'entrance exams', 'communication skills', 'specializations', 'applications', 'differences', 'ethics', 'skills', 'courses', 'school']"

""Yes or No"" questions halt discussion, while overly broad questions (such as ""What do you think about Romeo and Juliet?"") questions also tend to discourage discussion. The best questions are balanced; they are open enough that there seem to be a few good answers, yet closed enough that people know how to approach them, and feel motivated to start talking.   For example, suppose you’re discussing Romeo and Juliet. You may start by asking, ""In what ways does the Friar make mistakes in guiding Romeo? In what ways does he succeed?"" This question doesn't feed any answers, but leads students in a productive direction.; , As the discussion leader, you should come into the meeting with several ""big"" questions. Be prepared to ask the next one when discussion dies down, when people need more food for thought. The more prepared you feel when you walk into a classroom, the more confident you’ll look. If you look confident in your ideas and your approach, students will be more likely to respect you and to cooperate.   It can be helpful to give participants 1-2 questions in advance to give them more time to provide thoughtful contributions when the discussion comes. Also, it can be helpful to give participants the questions you'll discuss in class, on paper, or on the board. Some students learn better and think more effectively if they have the questions out in front of them. This can also be an excellent reminder of the main question for the day. In a 2 hour discussion, 2-5 good questions should suffice. It is also good to have 2 or 3 smaller sub-questions for each main question. However, you should prepare for at least 1.5 times as much material as you think you’ll cover, just in case students are particularly reticent that day or in case one line of inquiry wasn’t as fruitful as you thought it was.  , Everyone knows how to have a conversation; but a thoughtful discussion is more intentional and more focused than just a chat. If you want to start the conversation off on the right foot, then let the students know exactly what your expectations are. Should students raise their hand before speaking? Or should they speak freely without raising their hands? Should they use ""Mr."" and ""Ms."" when addressing their fellow students? These details clarify expectations and hence increase student confidence. You might also coach students on how to avoid personal biases in their responses, or any terms to use or avoid, and what to do if the discussion gets heated.If you have a handout with “Dos” and “Don’ts” listed on it, this can help students stay on track, too.  , It’s important for you and the students to have something you can all talk about before you begin the discussion. This can be almost anything: the assigned reading for that day’s class, a news story or poem, a work of art, or even a natural object like a sunset. The important thing is that you and the students share a common object of study so the discussion can be concrete instead of wallowing in abstractions.Make the expectations for being prepared clear. If you don’t have incentive for students to do the homework or consequences for students who are unprepared, then they’ll be less likely to come to class with fresh, exciting ideas.  , One way to make sure that the discussion goes well is to show your enthusiasm for the subject right from the beginning. If you have engaged body language, are alert and energetic, and show how the topic is important to your life and the lives of the students, they’ll be much more likely to be engaged. If they think that you’re tired, apathetic, or just trying to get the discussion over with, then they’ll be less likely to care.Even if a topic isn’t inherently fascinating, don’t try to cushion the blow by saying, “I know this isn’t that exciting, guys…” Instead, show that the topic is worth caring about; your students will follow. Sometimes, showing that something has real-world applications can help your students care about it. If you’re studying a historical event, for example, then starting off the class with a news article about an event with similar themes or values behind it — such as current protests against discrimination in relation to race riots of the 1960s — can help students stay engaged.  , One helpful way to begin the discussion is to define any key terms that may be useful to your students throughout the discussion. For example, if you’re giving a lesson on poetry, you can discuss simile, metaphor, allusion, or any other literary devices that are central to the poem. If all of your students feel like they’re on the same page and have a strong foundation before they begin the discussion, then they’ll be much more confident about participating.   Even if it feels like you’re oversimplifying things a bit, it’s better to have everyone on the same page before the discussion really kicks off than to lose a few students. Some students may be too shy to admit they’re confused about some of the more simple terms, and it’s important to explain them before you can move forward.  , In order to lead a meaningful discussion, you should strike a balance between confidence about what you know and a willingness to learn more. A discussion is an adventure -- you may not know exactly where it will go, but you can lead the way. If you are willing to be vulnerable in showing that you don't know everything, students will be more likely to be vulnerable too.   Present yourself as a professional in dress and body language: stand tall, make eye contact, and smile. Be genuinely excited about your students’ ideas to help generate enthusiasm for the topic. Point out great comments and ask the student to repeat it. They may not even realize that they made a great comment!  , One of your most important jobs is creating an atmosphere of respect, even respectful disagreement. If you want to encourage your students to participate, then you have to give them a safe environment for doing so. You have to make it clear that all of the students deserve respect and that no one will be made to feel unworthy because of their ideas or opinions. You should treat students positively and reward them for contributing.And never make them feel stupid, and don't let other students do so. If a student is being rude to another student, address the problem head-on instead of letting the conversation go on; if you say nothing, you’ll make it look like it’s acceptable for students to be rude to each other. Encourage students for speaking instead of tearing them down. Make them feel excited to join the discussion, instead of self-conscious.  , Don't just share your feelings or opinions without backing them up. If you’re discussing Romeo and Juliet and someone asserts, ""The Friar shouldn't have given Romeo any advice!"" ask them why that is so. Discuss possible support or objections to their claim. Use the ""Pros and Cons"" model; argue for a position, and then let students argue against it (or argue against it yourself!). Ask: which conclusion would hold up better in a court of law? This can lead to meaningful results without having the students feel like you’re spoon-feeding them the answers.   Help guide students to reach conclusions for themselves. If the objective of the discussion is only to make the students see the “right” answer, then you might as well have lectured at them instead.  , No one can learn if they know everything already; and no one can learn if they know nothing. A good discussion begins when we realize we know something but need to learn more. Even if you feel you have answered a question, press deeper. Find another puzzle you don't yet understand, or move to the next area of interest. Once you’ve established something you and the group have puzzled out, move on to a new, more complicated mystery. Use your previous discussion as a reference point and continue to dig deeper.   Treat each new “unknown” as an exciting mystery that the students will solve together. Even if you’ve already thought it through, act like you’re figuring it out right along with them.  , Some students love to discuss and debate; others feel anxious speaking in a group. Give space to each different person, and don't worry if you sometimes make mistakes. Make sure every participant has an opportunity to be heard. Some will not take the opportunity, but they will feel cared for that it was presented. Work to make sure that every student is heard, and that some students aren’t heard too much. Make it so students with conflicting personalities don’t have misunderstandings and that everyone gets along, for the most part.   For the more talkative student, here are a few tips: 1. Ask them to speak only 5 times that day and make them keep track of their comments; this allows them to decide which comments are really important. 2. Ask them to help lead the discussion; let them ask questions and not just answer your questions every time. 3. Invite them to write out their thoughts and present a conclusion at the end of class. 4. Tell them that they get a turn to speak every time a quieter person speaks first; this will encourage them to balance each other out. For the quieter student, here are a few tips: 1. Try specifically ask the quieter members what they think of the topic. 2. Invite them to write their thoughts out and offer to read their thoughts to the class at the beginning of the next discussion. 3. Allow room for silence and reflection while ""internal processors"" think through the discussion. Be aware of the different personality types in your classroom and of how they succeed the most in group discussions. For example, if you have a student who likes to absorb the conversation and then weigh in toward the end, let this student take the time he needs instead of forcing him to speak when he’s not ready. Don't take it personally if some students refuse to participate. They may have other things going on in their life, such as social anxiety or family stress, that make it difficult for them to engage. Encourage them, if possible, that their presence matters.  , One technique to help maintain a productive class discussion is to write down the ideas of your students throughout the discussion. This can remind students of what you’re talking about and can give them something to point back to. You can even write their ideas down in a slightly more articulate way to help frame the discussion. If you do this, though, make sure you write down most of the ideas that are said so some students don’t feel discouraged if you don’t write down their ideas.   You can even consider having one student as a designated “note taker” who stands at the board and writes down the ideas as they come.  , When you lead a class discussion, you may be feeling self-conscious and thinking that if it’s not going well, that it’s because the students don’t like you or respect you. This negative thinking will only discourage you instead of focusing on the topic at hand. If your students aren’t responding well or aren’t as engaged as they could be, then remind yourself that this is because the topic could be presented in a new light, not because there’s something wrong with you.Once you stop focusing on there being something wrong with you, you’ll have more freedom to turn to the discussion topic and to make the conversation as dynamic as possible.  , One important aspect of leading a discussion is making sure that you hit most of the important points you wanted to hit. If students get too stuck on one point that isn’t central to the discussion, then you can move the conversation along to the more important aspects of the day’s material. That said, if you find that students are having a fascinating conversation about something you didn’t intend to hit and that they are really learning from each other, then you can continue to use this time to explore a new line of thinking.   Time management is an important part of leading a class discussion. It’s important to keep the students on track and avoid talking about one minor quibble for the entirety of your class time. Find a way to subtly check the clock or your watch from time to time. You don’t want to make the students nervous when you do this. Give students a ""two minute warning"" to allow them to slow down, reflect, and present any closing thoughts or last words.  , One way to help move the discussion forward is to help students talk to each other instead of to you. As long as the conversation is respectful and well-meaning, then having them directly address each other’s points can help them get to know each other and can facilitate a meaningful discussion without any barriers. If you find that this technique is making the conversation too aggressive or argumentative, then you can pull students back a bit.   Having the students talk to each other more can lead to a more dynamic, exciting discussion. They’ll feel like they can talk more openly if they’re talking to each other instead of just addressing the teacher. Just make sure to stress that they should do this in a respectful manner and that focuses on the person’s ideas, not the person.  , Unfortunately, just one problem student can ruin an entire discussion. If there’s a person in your class who always talks out of turn, interrupts others constantly, puts down the views of others, or just generally disrespects you and the other students, then you need to work on addressing the problem head-on as quickly as you can so this one student doesn’t keep the others from learning. You can first try to address the problem in class, and if that doesn’t work, you can pull the student aside and talk about his or her behavior privately.   There are many kinds of problem students. For example, if one of your students talks out of turn, stress the importance of raising his hand before he speaks. If you have a student who talks too much, tell him to wait until at least four other people have spoken before contributing again. Though this may sound harsh, it can help this student focus on listening to what others have to say. Occasionally, though thankfully not very often, an overbearing participant may need to be removed from the discussion. Mostly, such students respond well to gentle but firm correction. It does happen, though, that a student refuses to play by the rules. It is not fair to the participants who want to learn to allow one person to ruin the discussion. If possible, and after many warnings, you may want to find a way to organize the discussion without them. If you have students who are distracted or doing other things during your class, sit them up front and pay extra attention to them. If you’re having trouble leading a discussion because many students aren’t doing the reading, then you should incentivize them to do their homework by giving reading check quizzes at the beginning of class, making class participation a higher percentage of the course grade, or finding other ways to hold them more accountable for doing their work.  , One way to make sure that all of the students are on the same page is to summarize the class discussion as you move forward. You can make it feel seamless, and not like an interruption of the conversation. Even repeating the points that you or your students have made with extra care can help your students get a firmer painting of the big picture. Make a point of slowing down and rebooting every 20 minutes or so, especially if you’re teaching a longer class, so that everyone is on track.   You can ask other students to help you with this task. Say something like, “Okay, what have we learned so far?” and have volunteers help you out.  , When the allotted time for the discussion is up, or when things have reached a natural end point, do a full summary of what you covered. Talk about the point you started from, and remind the students of any arguments that were made along the way. Don’t invalidate any arguments and focus on bringing together all of the different ideas you talked about instead of acting like you’re showing students the one and only way something should be done. Make sure you leave some time to do this so your students aren’t distracted and ready to pack up their bags.   This is where leaving notes on the board during the discussion can really come in handy. Having something you can point to can make it easier to wrap up your ideas. You can even try having another student or two wrap up the class discussion. This can make students feel more accountable and involved.  , Make sure to leave at least a few minutes for questions at the end of class. You want students to leave the discussion feeling like they learned something, not like they are utterly confused. If you wait until the class is almost over to ask if anyone has questions, then students will be much more reluctant to say anything because they won’t want to hold up or even prolong the class. Leave a suitable amount of time for questions and make sure to encourage students to speak up if they’re confused.   Answering the students’ questions can also help you wrap up the discussion more thoroughly. Having people ask questions can also give you insight into the strengths and weaknesses of your discussion. If five students seem to be confused about the same thing, then it may be because you didn’t cover it thoroughly enough in your discussion.  , Close with a related question, or a ""suggestion for further research."" This will give all involved something to think about for next time. You shouldn’t leave students feeling like you discussed absolutely everything there was to say about the given topic and that you had completely solved the puzzle together. Instead, you should have moved the conversation forward, helped students gain valuable insight, and leave them looking forward to the next discussion.   Leaving your students wanting more can also give you a logical place to pick up during the next class. They’ll come to class feeling ready and excited to continue the conversation, and they may have even gained some insight into the topic in the meantime. Consider conducting a brief “check out”. Let students talk about where the discussion leaves them or where they will go next. They can do this at the end of class, or even in a written survey they take during the last few minutes of class.  , After the discussion is over, ask yourself who did the most talking, who did the least talking, and who contributed the most meaningfully to the conversation. Keep in mind that talking the most doesn’t actually mean contributing the most, either. The next time you lead a discussion, you can work on encouraging the more quiet students a bit more, and making sure that everyone has a chance to speak and that the students don’t feel dominated by a few more confident speakers.Remind yourself that no discussion is perfect. As you improve at leading class discussions, you’ll improve at making sure that all students participate in the conversation.

Severe back pain can come on quickly, but it can sometimes go away quickly also (without any treatment whatsoever) because the body has a tremendous ability to heal itself. As such, be patient for a few hours if you experience a bout of bad back pain, avoid any strenuous activities and keep a positive attitude.   Signs and symptoms for which you should seek immediate medical attention include: muscle weakness and/or loss of sensation in your arms or legs, loss of bladder or bowel control, high fever, sudden weight loss.Total bed rest is not a good idea for most types of back pain because some movement (even just brief, leisurely walks) is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing. If you are in a lot of pain, wait two to three days before resuming normal activities.If your back pain is exercise related, then you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form — consult with a personal trainer. If you think your back pain is work related, then talk to your boss about switching activities or altering your work station — such as a more supportive chair or a cushioned mat for underneath your feet.; , The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all acute (occurring in the last 24 – 48 hours) musculoskeletal injuries, including back pain.Cold therapy should be applied to the most painful part of your back in order to reduce the inflammation and numb the pain. Ice should be applied for 10 – 15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.   Compressing the ice against your back with a stretchy bandage or elastic support will also help control the inflammation. Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin. If you don't have any ice or gel packs, then use a frozen bag of veggies from your freezer. Ice is not be appropriate for chronic back pain — moist heat may provide more relief.  , Soaking your back in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling, especially if the pain is caused by muscle spasm or strain.The magnesium in the salt helps the muscles relax. Soaking in a warm bath or applying heat directly to your back likely isn't a good idea if you're experiencing lots of inflammation, which is often the result of joint, ligament and nerve injuries of the back.   Don't make the water too hot (to prevent scalding) and don't soak in the bath for much more than 30 minutes because the salty water will pull fluid from your body and start to dehydrate you. Alternatively, apply moist heat to your back pain — microwaved herbal bags work well and are often infused with aromatherapy (such as lavender) that has relaxing properties.  , Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with bad pain or inflammation in your back.Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch.   Alternatively, you can try over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine) for your back pain, but never take them concurrently with NSAIDs. Pain relieving creams and gels applied directly to your sore back are another option, especially if the pain is more muscle related. Capsaicin and menthol are natural ingredients in some creams that act to distract your brain from the pain by making your skin tingle.  , Rolling on a piece of firm foam is a good way to massage your spine and potentially relieve mild-to-moderate discomfort, especially in the mid back (thoracic) region. Foam rollers are commonly used in physiotherapy, yoga and pilates.Pick up a foam roller at a sporting goods or big-box store — they're very inexpensive and nearly indestructible. Place the foam roller on the ground, perpendicular to where you're going to lay your body. Lie down on your back so that the foam roller is beneath your shoulders and begin to roll back and forth. Repeat as many times as necessary, although your muscles might be a little sore after the first time you use a foam roller.  , Lie down on your back and place a ball between your shoulder blades. Roll around until you find a tender spot. Hold that position for at least 30 seconds, or until you feel the pain going away. Move on to other tender spots.   Repeat this every day until the pain improves. This may be used as a preventive measure since these trigger points, most commonly known as muscle knots, have a tendency to appear again due to bad posture or overuse.  , While your back pain may make you reluctant to move or exercise, stretching and strengthening your body can reduce back pain. Before starting exercise, consult with your doctor or a physical therapist about which exercises are appropriate for your specific condition.Exercises such as squats, planks, or simple, gentle stretches can help reduce back pain. Get more ideas by reading the following articles: Treat Lower Back Pain and Treat Upper Back Pain.  , Mattresses that are too soft or pillows that are too thick may contribute to back pain. Avoid sleeping on your stomach as it can cause your head and neck to twist in ways that aggravate back pain and it can also compress and irritate lower back joints.The best sleeping positions for back pain are on your side (similar to the classic fetal position) or on your back with a pillow elevating your legs, which takes some pressure off the low back joints.   Although even waterbeds can be comfortable for some people, most people seem to benefit from a firm orthopedic mattress. Spring mattresses typically last about eight to 10 years with constant use, depending on the weight of you and your partner.  , Bad back pain can often be aggravated by improper lifting posture. When you need to lift something, make sure it is not too heavy for you to carry alone (and ask for help if it is). Keep the load close to your body, turning with your entire body instead of twisting or stretching at the waist.   There is some disagreement about the very best way to lift a heavy load, but if you want to lift without putting stress on your back, you should squat, bending at the hips and knees but keeping your back straight, and lift from this position. This will allow you to lift with your legs and not your back.  , Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement.   Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back pain, more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments to notice significant results. Your health insurance may not cover chiropractic care. Chiropractors and osteopaths also use a variety of therapies tailored more towards muscle strains, which may be more appropriate for your back issue. Traction techniques or stretching of your spine with an inversion table may also help your back pain. Some chiropractors have inversion tables in their offices, which allows you to turn yourself upside down in a controlled and easy way, enlisting the help of gravity to decompress your spine. Consider buying an inversion table for home use.  , A strained muscle occurs when individual muscle fibers tear, which leads to pain, inflammation and some degree of guarding (muscle spasm in attempts to prevent further damage). A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your entire spine and hips. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.   Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.  , Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture for back pain can be effective, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain.   There is mixed scientific evidence that acupuncture is helpful in relieving chronic back pain, but there's lots of anecdotal reports that many people find it extremely helpful.Acupuncture points that may provide relief to your back pain are not all located near where you feel the pain — some can be in distant areas of the body. Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.""Dry needling"" is another type of therapy involving acupuncture needles, but without the Chinese traditional medical techniques. It may be helpful to relieve pain., Stress-relieving practices like meditation, tai chi and breathing exercises have been found to help alleviate musculoskeletal pain and help prevent injuries in many people. Yoga is also great for relaxation and involves practicing specific postures or poses and helpful breathing exercises.Yoga poses can stretch and strengthen muscles and improve posture, although you might need to modify some poses if they aggravate your back pain. Try mindful meditation. Mindful meditation is a form of pain management that can be done anywhere at any time.One study found that three 20-minute meditation sessions over the course of three days not only reduced pain, it also appeared to have a lasting effect far beyond the 20 minutes spent in meditation., If diligent home care and alternative therapies are not effective for alleviating your back pain, then make an appointment with your family physician in order to consider any potentially serious spinal issues such as a herniated disc, nerve entrapment, infection (osteomyelitis), osteoporosis, stress fracture, rheumatoid arthritis or cancer.X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and nerve conductance studies are modalities that your doctor may use to help diagnose your back pain. Your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection such as meningitis. Your doctor may refer you to medical specialists such as an orthopedist, neurologist or rheumatologist in order to better figure out your back condition.  , If your back pain is recurring (chronic) and caused by weak spinal muscles, poor posture or degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, then you need to consider some form of rehabilitation. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your back.Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 4-8 weeks to positively impact chronic back problems.   If need be, a physiotherapist can treat your sore back muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Good strengthening exercises for your back include swimming, rowing and back extensions, but make sure your pain is under control first.  , An injection of steroid medication near or into spinal joints, muscles, tendons or ligaments can quickly reduce inflammation and pain, and allow normal movement of your back again.Corticosteroids are hormones that display powerful anti-inflammatory properties. The most common preparations used are prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone.   Potential complications of corticosteroid injections include infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation / damage. If corticosteroid injections fail to provide adequate resolution for your back pain, then as a last resort, surgery should be explored.

The Harvard Law admissions office will be happy to put you in touch with a student who will share their experience.You can call them at 617-495-3179, or email them at jdadmiss@law.harvard.edu., Harvard Law uses rolling admissions, so according to the dean, there is an advantage to applying early before too many of the places are filled. The application typically goes live in late September. For the best chance of getting in, you should be ready to submit your application then or shortly thereafter., You will apply at LSAC website. You’ll want to start early in order to acquire recommendations, complete the LSAT on time, and make sure your personal statement and resume are as good as you can make them. The application consists of 7 mandatory parts:A fee of $85 The application form Your resumé A personal statement Your LSAT scores 2-3 recommendation letters. (At least one should be from an academic. If you have been out of school for a long time, you may submit non-academic recommendations, or consider taking extended education college courses to get to know a professor.) Character and Fitness Questions (to determine eligibility for the bar upon graduation) An interview (granted to approximately 1,200 applicants)  , Harvard Law strives to admit a diverse mix of students. A diversity statement gives you a chance to place your achievements in the context of your background and to make a case for how you would increase diversity on campus., Particularly if there are discrepancies in your application, such as a low GPA and high LSAT, consider including an addendum to explain them, preferably in a way that turns a weakness into a strength. For example, if you had low undergrad GPA, you might address it up front, and explain that between working your way through school and your commitment to an extracurricular (sports, student government, debate, etc.), it was difficult to maintain your grades, but you learned valuable things from these other experiences., You can major in anything and get into Harvard law, though you’d do best to avoid criminal justice, which is not considered an academically rigorous major.The key is to pick a subject that is rigorous, that you enjoy, and in which you can make good grades. If you want to study chemistry, go for it, but know that you will need to supplement your major with electives that demonstrate your reading, research, and writing skills. Here are some common “pre-law” majors.History – Teaches strong reading, research, and writing skills, as well as a basic knowledge of U.S. laws and politics.Philosophy – Teaches logic, critical analysis, close reading, and writing, and is considered a very rigorous major.Economics – Teaches analysis and logical thinking. A senior thesis that displays research and writing skills will boost your application. Economics is considered preferable to business.Political Science – Teaches strong reading and presentation skills, as well as a basic knowledge of the U.S. legal system. However, political science is considered a less rigorous major, so you will need a very good GPA. If possible, do a senior thesis to supplement your courses and show strong research and writing skills.English – Shows strong reading and writing skills, but you will need to supplement your course work with research heavy courses.  Science majors – The difficulty of these majors makes a high GPA even more impressive. That said, you will need to take electives to show you are strong in reading, writing, and research. Also, your application will be stronger if you say you are planning on being a patent or intellectual property lawyer.Art/Music/Film – Harvard law actually likes students with less traditional backgrounds, though to get in with a major in the arts you will need a great GPA, supplemental course work in fields like history, economics, or philosophy, and preferable a senior thesis., Harvard law accepts students from a wide variety of majors, but to maximize your chances of getting in and succeeding in law school, you’ll want to be sure to take courses that develop your reading, research, and writing skills. For example, if you’re an economics major with practice researching and analyzing data, you might want to take some history or literature electives to show that you also have developed reading and writing skills.Consider taking:Courses with term papers – Term papers might not be fun, but they require reading, research, and writing, making these classes the ideal preparation for law school.  Courses that emphasize reading – Literature, philosophy, history, and political science.  Courses that emphasize textual research – Economics, psychology, sociology, history, or any course with a term paper. (The key here is textual research, so lab work will not be as useful.)  Courses that emphasize writing – Literature, history, philosophy, or any course with a term paper.  , Harvard has high standards. For instance, a 3.75 GPA would only land you in the 25th percentile (meaning you did better than 25% of applicants) for the class of 2017. A 3.87 would get you to the 50th percentile, and a 3.95 would be needed to reach the 75th percentile., If your GPA is not where it needs to be, consider taking summer courses to boost it before your senior year. Increasing it by even .1 or .2 points can mean the difference between acceptance and rejection from Harvard., Lots of people who apply to Harvard Law have high GPAs and great LSAT scores. The right extracurricular can help set you apart. And if your GPA and LSAT aren’t as good as you'd like, they can make all the difference. The key is to start early – schools like Harvard are less impressed if you only participate your senior year – and to focus on quality over quantity. Pick 1 to 3 activities and really commit to them.Non-profit work – The larger and more prestigious the organization, the better. Think Habitat for Humanity or a Community Law Project or Clinic in your area.Legal internship – Most legal internships are for non-profits, government, or the American Bar Association. They are good summer experiences, but not necessarily better than any other extracurricular activity. See here for a sample of possible internships.  Debate – Debate teaches you a number of skills useful in law: memorization, crafting arguments, speaking extemporaneously, and analyzing texts, amongst them.Pre-law – Pre-law societies run activities like mock trials and cross-examination exercises, and often have journals that you can contribute to. Participation builds valuable skills and shows a passion for law.Model United Nations – Allows you to practice diplomacy and mediation. And since most law cases are settled before trial in mediation or arbitration, this is a vital skill.Student government – Just serving is not enough. Focus on what you have done for your school and the specific changes you have implemented.Other campus organizations - Any campus organization can be a bright spot on your resume, so long as you hold a leadership position in the organization and can show you made an impact., There are prelaw study abroad programs, but any abroad experience is valuable. Harvard Law appreciates the cultural experience and language proficiency that come from a semester abroad., You don’t have to apply to law school in college. In fact, taking a few years off to work will actually make you a more attractive candidate to Harvard Law.Having work experience makes you more employable, as well as teaching you responsibility and valuable time management skills that make you a better student. And if you take the right job, it can also give you exposure to the field of law. Any job in an intellectual field – teaching, working in government, clerking – will boost your resume, but here are some of the best jobs to consider:   Paralegal or legal assistant – These jobs will not necessarily give you an advantage over other jobs – indeed, Harvard Law likes people with eclectic backgrounds – but they certainly won’t hurt you, and more importantly, they can help you to decide if law is right for you.A non-law job related to the law field you are interested in. If you are interested in corporate law, you might work in business. If you are interested in patent or intellectual property law, you might work in tech. In general, you will get the most out of your non-law job if it relates to the field you want to practice in., Particularly if you didn't participate in a lot of extracurriculars in college, your post-graduate life can be a great time to improve this portion of your resume. Prestigious national organizations will carry the most weight, but anything that shows commitment, leadership, and tangible results will help. You should even consider signing up for full-time service opportunities like Teach for America, the Peace Corps, or Americorps., Especially if you have been out of school for a while, acing courses at a local college can show that you have matured as a student. The better the college you take the classes at, the more weight these results will carry.These courses can be particularly useful for people who have been out of school for 3+ years, as they can yield academic recommendations.  , A graduate degree costs money (unless you get a scholarship), but if it can get you into Harvard Law, then it will probably be worth it in the long run. Especially if you attend a top school, there are several benefits:   A graduate degree gives you a chance to soften the blow of a bad undergrad GPA. Grad GPAs are not factored into LSAC’s GPA calculations, but they are reported and can shows that you have matured as a student.Graduate degrees can yield fresh recommendations from professors. Your degree can make you a more viable candidate for certain fields of law. For instance, if you are going into corporate or tax law, a MBA or accountant’s degree can help. If you are entering patent or intellectual property law, a graduate degree in a scientific field can help tremendously., The LSAT is offered only on a few dates each year, usually once each in June, October, November, December, and February. It is best to take the February test the year before you apply or the June test the year you apply, so you can get your application in early. The December test is the last one you can take and still apply that same year. Registration is typically due over a month before the test date, so plan ahead. You can find more information on specific dates and register for the test on the LSAC website.   You must have taken the test within the last 5 years before applying to Harvard law.  , The LSAT is scored on a scale of 120-180. To get into Harvard, you’ll likely need to score in at least the 170s. For the class of 2017, scores of 170, 173, and 175 would put you in the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively., For the most part, the LSAT does not test skills that you learn in class. Instead, it focuses on logic, language ability, and reading comprehension. It consists of five 35 minutes sections of multiple choice questions, only four of which are scored (the fifth is to try out questions for future tests), and one unscored 35 minute writing sample. The question types are:Reading Comprehension (one 35 minute section) – You will be asked to read a text and then answer questions about its content and structure. This question format will be familiar if you have taken the SAT, only the texts you must read will be more difficult.  Analytical Reasoning (one 35 minute section) – Also known as Logic Games, these problems test your deductive reasoning and ability to structure data, and are of the type: “Jill, Bob, Susan, Erik, and Stan must be seated at the same table. Jill can’t sit next to Susan or Erik. Bob must be beside Stan…” Most test takers find them the most challenging part of the test.  Logical Reasoning (two 35 minutes sections) – These questions “evaluate the ability to analyze, critically evaluate, and complete arguments as they occur in ordinary language.”  , A week or two is not enough to prepare for the LSAT. For most people, it takes months of intense practice (15-20 hours a week) to reach the score they desire.At the very least, you will want to purchase previously administered LSAT's on the LSAC website to practice on and purchase a study guide. If you are still not happy with your scores, consider enrolling in an LSAT course or hiring a private tutor., If you do decide to enroll in a class, you’ll want to make sure it’s a good one. Be sure that your class is being taught by someone who scored at least a 170 on the test and that the course uses actual questions from the LSAT.And be sure to sign up well in advance of the test. Give yourself at least two months to prepare. Some highly ranked LSAT prep courses include:Power-Score Live LSAT Preparation Blueprint LSAT Preparation Manhattan LSAT Kaplan Test Prep The Princeton Review LSAT TestMasters  , You can take the LSAT up to 3 times in any 2 year period. Harvard Law – like most law schools – only uses your highest score in evaluating your candidacy, so there is no reason not to retake the test. If you score higher, they will use that score. If your score lower, they will use your previous score., If you’re in college, your career counseling office should be able to provide you with sample essays that worked. If not, you can buy books that contain personal statements that helped get the writer into Harvard Law, or you can find personal statements online here. The best way to know what works is to read what worked in the past.  , Don’t try to encapsulate your life in a short essay. Instead, you’ll have better luck picking one powerful experience and explaining its impact on you in a way that highlights some of your strengths as a candidate.Write about something you care about, even if it has nothing to do with why you are going to law school. The goal is to let your personality, strengths, and way of thinking shine through. They already know you want to go to Harvard Law. You applied. Don’t write about how your study abroad experience transformed you. It’s been done way, way too many times. If you are going to write about why you want to be a lawyer, know that this is probably the most common type of essay. That doesn’t make it a bad topic, but you’ll need to tell a particularly engaging story to avoid boring your reader., Your first paragraph should be engaging, or it might be all that an admissions officer reads. Consider opening with an honest statement about your values or something important to you, such as “I believe in freedom of expression,” and then going on to tell a story that develops why, and how that relates to your application. Or start with a sentence that leads into and explains the story you are about to tell, such as “I never thought much about what it meant to be blind until I met my best friend, Jim.”   Do not start with an overly dramatic story. This is a clichéd technique that has been used far too many times.If you are going to tell a story, make sure you first frame why it matters. Definitely don’t lead with something like “I’ve always dreamed of attending Harvard Law” or “I have a passion for the law.” (Unless you follow that statement with a twist like, “But then a professor told me what a terrible idea that was.”)  , It’s true in all writing: showing a vivid scene that illustrates your point is more effective than simply telling someone your point. So if you want to convey to Harvard Law that you have a passion for immigration law, for example, a story about your experience with an immigrant will leave a much more powerful impression than a simple statement about an internship., Unless you just got your PhD in medical research and are certain you will be entering patent law, you should steer clear of being too specific. Law school offers the opportunity to explore multiple fields of law and choose one that appeals to you., If you mention why you want to go to Harvard in particular, be sure you can back up your statement with accurate facts. If there is a particular professor you want to work with, make sure he or she is tenured and teaching regularly before you mention him or her in your essay., Re-read your essay multiple times to remove all errors, then have several people you trust closely read it as well. A simple spelling or grammar error will have a negative impact on the reader’s impression of you., If you are asked to interview via Skype, it means that the admissions committee finds your application promising. If you treat the interview as a sign that you’re doing well, it will be less stressful., Most candidates where a shirt and tie or a simple blouse, but if you feel more comfortable in a full suit or business casual, that is fine, too. The most important thing is that you are comfortable, which will help you to relax and give a good interview., Make sure the background behind you is neat and orderly. If the room you are in is a mess, it will leave a bad impression with the interviewer.A few well-chosen books on the shelf behind you, on the other hand, can reinforce your image as a serious student.  , The interview is meant to be conversational, so scripted answers will not help you. Please, don’t memorize anything, but it is a good idea to have a basic idea about how you will answer some typical questions:Why do you want to go to law school? What attracts you to Harvard Law, in particular? When did you decide to go to law school?What do you see yourself doing when you graduate?, The point of the interview is to learn about you as a person, not about your accomplishments. Avoid talking about your resume or listing examples found in your personal statement.You will score the most points with your interviewer if you come across as intelligent, curious, and fun to talk to.  , At some point, your interviewer will probably ask if you have any questions. You’ll need to have some ready, and because it’s important to have researched Harvard Law in advance, they shouldn’t be things that can be easily answered simply by browsing the University’s website. So instead of asking “what opportunities are there for gaining practical experience,” you might ask “I’m really interested in the Transactional Law Clinics; can you tell me more about how they work and build on classroom instruction?” The point of the question is not only to gather information, but also to show that you are intelligent and inquisitive.

Point it out to each customer who makes a purchase.Similarly, you can instruct your cashiers to ask each customer who approaches the register for an e-mail address. Make sure that your cashiers tell your customers that providing an e-mail address is only optional while explaining the benefits of doing so.; , Place a basket, empty fishbowl, or similar container near the register or in another equally visible location. Place a label or sign on it so people will know to drop their business cards inside.   Typically, these types of collections are encouraged by the use of special offers or contests. For instance, you might include a note saying that a random drawing will take place every week, and the winner will receive a certain percentage or dollar amount off his or her next purchase.  , Look for events that would allow you to meet prospective customers for your business. Bring a clipboard sign-up sheet with you to collect e-mail addresses at these events.   Participate in as many trade-shows and fairs as possible. These events attract potential customers, whereas conventions and conferences only tend to attract other business owners in your field. Depending on the nature of your business, you may also host your own event, like a luncheon, consultation, or show. You can even require attendees to sign up via e-mail for these events.  , When you ship an order to someone, include a separate packing insert in the package that asks customers to sign up for your e-mail newsletter.   Provide clear instructions on signing up. Include the URL to a specific sign-up page or the e-mail address customers can contact if they wish to be added to your subscribers. Similarly, you can make the request directly on the packing sheet itself. It may not stand out as much as a separate insert would, but it can be a good way to cut costs while still spreading the word.  , Any guide, printed newsletter, printed advertisement, or other printed material produced and/or distributed by your company should include a request for e-mail addresses within the overall content.   The same principle also applies to digital material produced by your company, like videos and podcasts.  , The sign-up form should be very easy to find and located on each page of your website. Make the process as simple and brief as possible to encourage as many subscriptions as possible.The sign-up form might be nothing more than a small, clearly identified box at the top of the website. On the other hand, you might include a link at the top of each page that directs potential subscribers to a separate sign-up page and form. This form should be fairly brief, requiring as little information as possible (name and e-mail address). If you also have a separate blog for your company, include the form or a link to the form on a highly visible spot of your blog, too.  , Even though most people find pop-up ads annoying, it can actually be a good idea to include a pop-up ad encouraging visitors to sign-up for e-mail content. The key is to format this ad so that it pops up as visitors reach the bottom of the page or leave the website.   Someone who was interested enough in your content to spend time reading it is more likely to provide an e-mail address than someone who just stumbled onto your website for the first time. As such, the pop-up should always come at the end of the visiting experience and never at the beginning.  , Customers who purchase from you online will usually need to provide an e-mail address. Ask for permission to add this e-mail address to your subscribers during the check-out process.   This can usually be accomplished by including a check-box just above the “Submit Order” button. Beside this check-box, include a line like, “Check here to receive special promotions, offers, and news via e-mail.”  , If you aren't already taking advantage of social media to connect to prospective and existing customers, you should start. Post requests for customer e-mail addresses on occasion through each of your social media accounts.   Send text-based tweets on Twitter or post text-based and picture-based statues on Facebook. Post picture-based advertisements for your e-mail newsletter on Pinterest and Instagram.  , When creating a business signature to automatically paste at the bottom of each e-mail you send, provide instructions on how the receiver of your message can add his or her name to your list of subscribers.   A link can be especially beneficial if you add it to the signature of your company's standard contact e-mail address. Doing so automatically informs anyone who contacts you with questions about your company to learn about your e-mail list.  , Post a screenshot of your e-mail newsletter or similar piece of content somewhere your online visitors can see. This sneak peek should provide a glimpse at some of the content typically included in your newsletter.   Another way to offer a sneak peek would be to archive old editions of past newsletters. This gives potential subscribers a way to look through multiple copies of your newsletter for a more thorough idea of what they will receive by signing up.  , Instead of using text-only advertisements to ask for e-mail addresses, accompany the text with a compelling image. Pictures tend to catch the eye more effectively than text does.   Make sure that the image you use is related to your company in some way. For instance, if you sell garden supplies, the visual could be as simple as a photograph of a beautifully maintained garden.  , Consider offering a free gift to customers who sign up for your e-mail newsletter. The gift should be fairly small yet still worthwhile enough to offer some incentive.   For instance, you might offer a free informative PDF file about a topic that would interest your prospective customers. On the other hand, the gift could be something like 10 percent off the customer's next purchase, if that purchase is made within the next 30 days.  , Tell customers who sign up for your e-mail newsletter that they will receive a special gift on or around their birthday. As with sign-up gifts, the offer must be affordable for you yet appealing to them.   Free stuff is usually the gift of choice for a birthday club. If you have a storefront, you might e-mail customers a voucher on their birthday that can be traded in person for a small token. Another option is to offer a free gift with a minimal purchase or a significant discount.  , A good way to get a larger volume of new e-mail addresses at one time is to host a giveaway or contest for new subscribers. The winner of your contest should receive a prize, and that prize should be announced ahead of time.Since fewer people will actually win these prizes, they should be worth considerably more than the gift you would give for a birthday club or at sign-up. You may also offer the chance to earn additional entries for old and new subscribers who advertise your contest via social media, blogs, or other public forums.  , You can post most discounts and offers online for all of your customers to see, but you should also offer the occasional discount that is only available to your e-mail subscribers.   Instruct subscribers to input a certain discount code during the check-out process. Do not post this discount code anywhere on your website, though.  , Getting e-mail subscribers are one thing, but keeping them is another. You need to make sure that the e-mails you send out to your subscribers are worthwhile. Otherwise, they may choose to unsubscribe.   This also means that the messages you do send must all be worthwhile. If you flood your subscribers with three to four e-mails each day, and those e-mails very rarely offer anything of substance, many of your subscribers will choose to delete your messages without reading them.  , Offer incentives to your employees for gathering e-mail addresses.   Offer a bonus or similar monetary incentive to employees who collect a certain number of valid e-mail addresses. To discourage cheating, make sure that your employees know that these e-mail addresses must be valid and will be verified before the reward is granted.  , Provide incentives to any current customers or subscribers to encourage them to refer friends and family to your e-mail list.   Customers who refer you to others should be made eligible for a special discount.  , If your e-mail newsletter is strong enough to stand as its own incentive, your current subscribers may want to pass it along without any extra encouragement. Include a “forward to a friend” link at the bottom of each newsletter to simplify the process for them.This link should redirect the subscriber to a web-based form. On that form, provide room for the subscriber to enter multiple e-mail addresses and include a short message. You can also use this trick in conjunction with a customer referral program.  , Work together with other companies and businesses who share a similar clientele. Ask them to advertise your e-mail list, and in return, offer to do the same for them.   You can trade spaces within your newsletters, on your blogs, or on your social media pages. If both businesses send print materials through the mail, you may also send each others' packing inserts.

Any name you choose for the child must be shown to be in his or her best interest. For example, if you adopted the child, a name change would clearly be in the child’s best interest as you are making the change to fully incorporate him or her into your family. On the other hand, a frivolous name change, such as wanting to change your child’s name to “Daenerys Stormborn” or “Coca-Cola,” is unlikely to be demonstrably in the child’s best interest.  , For a child, you must fill out the Application for Change of Name for a Minor Child.

Introversion is not shyness, social anxiety nor avoidant behavior. Just because introverts can pull out the social fireworks when necessary does not mean that they are not in fact introverted or are faking it. You don't know how ""passing"" by being social and extroverted in a given situation affected that person. Ultimately, introverts do have different needs for self care than people who tend to be more socially oriented.Rather than jump to judgement, try to sit back and learn. Talk to the introvert, instead of assuming you've got him all figured out.; , The best way to find out more about your friend and how you can help him feel more comfortable is simply to ask him. Friendships are wonderful things to nurture, and the point of friendship is to get to know someone, care about him, and keep his best interests in mind. Take the time to find out about what introversion is like for your friend, what his challenges are, and how he feels. Ask concrete, complete questions, as these types of questions may be easier for someone with introverted qualities to answer.Your friend may feel relieved that you are taking interest and showing that you care. Here are some questions and suggestions you may want to start with:What are the easiest social situations for you to be in? What kinds of social situations are the most tiring? Is there anything I can do to help you when you feel socially overwhelmed or drained? Do I ever make you feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed in social situations? How can I help ease that?  , This rule is important and is often the hardest for most extroverts to understand. Introverts like people, but their inner electrical systems are wired very differently. When they're grouchy, crotchety, or just tired, they need time to themselves. If extroverts are solar cells, absorbing light and energy externally, then introverts are nuclear power plants, internally charging a 'self-battery'. They need time alone so the battery has time to charge up again.In almost every case, the absences of introverts or their need for time alone has nothing to do with you. It's about them and what they need for their own well-being. Give your introvert plenty of space and don’t try to pressure the introverted person in your life to be social when he feels tired or overwhelmed. Introverts have limits when it comes to social stimulation.  , Don’t try to pressure your introverted friend into going someplace or doing something that he isn’t comfortable doing. If your friend tells you he is tired and not feeling like going to a party, don’t get upset with him, don’t try to manipulate or guilt him into going, and respect that he wants and may need time to himself. Call another friend or always plan to bring someone else with you so that you won’t take your disappointment out on your introverted friend. Being a true friend means you nurture healthy, honest boundaries in your relationship.Don't barrage your friend with emails, texts, and messages if he hasn't been in touch for a bit. This can be overwhelming to the introvert; instead, trying sending ONE message that you're thinking of him.  , Explore other ways of communication that may not be as draining for your introvert than talking in person. Some introverts find it easier to talk over the internet or in other non-verbal ways of communicating like texting. Get to know what makes your introvert most comfortable.Keeping the lines of communication open can ensure that there aren’t misunderstandings and that you don’t take your introverts’ need for alone time personally. You need to learn that when your introverted friend isn't feeling very social or breaks plans with you, it is not personal and is not about you. It is instead something that your friend needs and is related to their essential nature.If you haven't heard from your introverted friend, rather than call or visit him in person, try sending a brief text message that says something like, ""Hey, haven't heard from you in a bit. Just checking in and hope all is well."" Remember that introverts sometimes prefer more distanced modes of communication. As a helpful tip, introverts often screen their phone calls, even those from friends, because they find it interrupting and also taxing. Often, introverts let their calls go to voicemail so they can return them when they feel it's the right time and they have sufficient energy. So your introverted friend isn't ignoring you when he doesn't pick up but will get back to you when he feels ready., Listening is an essential part of any friendship. It is important to listen carefully to your friend that has introverted qualities because they may not be that comfortable expressing themselves frequently. In other words, pay attention! In addition, because of their tendency to reflect and think internally (instead of out loud, like extroverts), introverts tend to do the bulk of listening in conversations. They usually don't mind this, but it's also important to let them express their thoughts, feelings, and opinions while you sit back for once and take it in.Be in the moment and focus your mind on what your friend is saying. Put away your phone or turn it off. Give your friend your full attention. Try not to immediately let your mind get flooded with responses. Listen closely, maintain eye contact, concentrate on his words, and take a moment to digest what your friend has said before responding. Try to avoid responding with minimizing statements like, ""Oh everybody feels that way sometimes."" Your introvert friend's experience is valid, what he feels is valid, and it’s not always helpful to immediately nullify what you have just heard by generalizing or downplaying it. Instead try responding with active listening responses and leading questions like, ""I hear you. It’s interesting that you reacted that way. Why do you think you had that response?""  , One of the marks of a true friendship is free-flowing and mutual honesty. Once you have learned more about your introverted friend and how his world may be different from yours, then it is healthy to encourage your friend to feel comfortable telling you how he feels. You aren’t a mind reader, and you can’t tap in to his energy or comfort levels at all times. A healthy friendship should include a level of communication where your introverted friend feels safe telling you what is really going on inside his head, even if it's something you may not want to hear.Let your introverted friend know that he can always be honest with you. If your friend decides that he just isn’t up for going out because even the thought of small talk feels exhausting, appreciate his honesty and react with empathy. You can express your own emotions, since honesty should be mutual, but avoid laying guilt or blame at your friend's feet. Instead, show empathy and compassion and let him know that you understand and respect his choice. Reacting compassionately will show your friend that he can be truthful and straightforward with you without fearing judgement or pressure. Introverts often feel that they have to put on social show just to appease their friends, and your friend may be very grateful that there is someone in his life he can be honest with about how he really feels., Introverts generally prefer to spend time at work and home alone or in a small group. They also prefer to do one thing at a time and spend their time on it, rather than be doing multiple things at the same time. Try to accommodate introverts wherever you can; perhaps that means inviting only one other friend out when you're planning a movie night with your introverted friend, instead of a huge group. Avoid organizing gatherings in big, crowded spaces, like festivals, which may overstimulate your introvert (due to the people, music, loud noises, etc). Create an environment in which your introverted friend feels safe and like he can be himself.   Make sure that introverts have a ""safe space"" where they can go. For example, if you run an office, consider enclosed conferences rooms of varying sizes as an option either for introverts to have some downtime to gather their thoughts and work privately or for small groups that need to work together but who might otherwise interrupt or distract their introverted colleagues., By encouraging honesty and creating space for your introverted friend to feel comfortable being himself, you are being a good example of a nurturing person who accepts him for who he is. The more this facet your friendship is nurtured, the more empowered, honest, and healthy your introverted friend can feel about his life and himself., One of the great things about having a circle of friends is that they all have different personalities, viewpoints, and ways of being and doing things. An essential part of having friends is getting to know them and all of their unique personalities. One useful thing to do that can help prepare you for personalities that may be different from your own is to read up on personality types. Learning more about introversion can help you understand your friend in a way that doesn’t lead to misunderstanding. Respect that enjoyment of life comes in many forms, and not just what you personally find fulfilling and fun. Learn about how your friend finds satisfaction and enjoyment.Read up on introversion and extroversion as the first pair of psychological preferences in determining personality type using the Myer-Briggs test. You can also decide, after reading, which preference applies to you. Knowing more about ourselves often helps us understand why and how we view the world and the people we care about. Learning about differences might help you in turn learn to appreciate the various outlooks, perspectives and advice that an introverted person can offer. For example, they approach social situations from a very different vantage point than an extrovert. Your introverted friend may have noticed something at a party or social gathering while you were too busy gabbing away to catch wind. As a general rule in life, it’s always to your benefit to learn about people who are different from you and share in their knowledge.  , Introverts require more energy to be social and find social encounters draining. Introverts find their energy in solitary, often creative pursuits, whereas extroverts are energized by others. While extroverts actually physiologically experience an intensification of the feel-good hormone dopamine when surrounded by others, introverts do not. They find contentment from within.Introverts are not necessarily shy, nor are they afraid of people or fearful of social settings. They are also not typically misanthropic, meaning that they dislike mankind and human society. In fact, introverts often have heightened abilities for sensitivity, empathy, and creativity.These characteristics can make introverts truly caring, solid friends.  , Introverts like to think. This does not necessarily mean an introvert's wonderings are any more meaningful or significant than an extrovert's. It's how they process the world and the people around them. They need to process their experience. Their introspection is in fact what makes them such excellent listeners.Note that introspection is not the same as ruminating, which is a compulsively focused attention on your problems, distress or mistakes and has been connected to mental health conditions like depression. Introspection is rather the examination and observation of one's internal mental and emotional processes, like a kind of self-examination.Introverts, because of their ability to internally tune in, tend to be drawn to more creative, detail-focused, and independent professions.  , Most introverts enjoy conversation with one person at a time. So don't take it personally if they're a bit quiet in a group situation. They're probably absorbing what everyone is saying, and turning it over a few times in their heads. This is part of their introspective and thoughtful nature. In addition, you may notice your introverted friend hanging around near the exit when surrounded by lots of people; this is how introverts cope in crowded places. They like to be able to make a quick exit if they need to., This is particularly true in social situations. Some introverts are not naturally social people. This can make it difficult to interact with others who are inherently more extroverted and gregarious. To make the going easier, many introverts have leaned how to be 'temporarily extroverted'; put differently, they act. Acting for them requires an extraordinarily amount of energy and effort. This is why many introverts need a little break or alone time after a big social event. But not to worry; if you and your introvert have a very close relationship, he'll be his 'real' self most, if not all of the time.  , Respect that this is a personality trait your friend lives and feels, and not a choice or lifestyle. It's a way of being.Respect that your friend has a different way of dealing with the world and of processing social stimulation and decision.",2196,"['friend', 'time', 'introverts', 'honesty', 'core', 'judgement', 'personality types', 'introversion', 'introvert', 'communication', 'boundaries']"

People use computers for countless reasons, but general use falls into one of the following categories. Keep these in mind when you are looking at laptops:Office/Schoolwork - Mostly use the computer for word processing, research, spreadsheets, and other professional and academic tasks. Games - Playing the latest and greatest games, but still using the computer for other tasks as well. Web use - Primarily using the computer to access websites, email, streaming video, and social media. Media production - Use the computer as a workstation to record music, edit video, or manipulate images.; , There are a lot of reasons you might want to pick a laptop over a desktop computer. As laptops become more powerful, the reasons for owning a desktop will continue to shrink.   A laptop is portable. This is the primary reason for purchasing a laptop. Laptops can go almost anywhere you can, and they're only getting lighter and thinner. Laptops can perform more and more tasks that desktops can. There are very few programs these days that a desktop can run that a laptop cannot. While you're generally sacrificing some performance for portability, you still have the ability to perform most computing tasks. Laptops can save a lot of space. A desktop computer, with a tower, monitor, keyboard, and mouse, can take up a lot of space in your home office or bedroom. A laptop just needs a little desk space.  , While laptops are becoming more powerful and lighter, there are still some drawbacks that you should consider if deciding between a laptop and a desktop.   A laptop is limited by the battery. You can only roam so much with a laptop. Eventually, it will need to be plugged in. Can be lost or stolen much easier. Because of their portable nature, laptops can be stolen or lost much easier than a desktop. If you're setting up an office, you'll probably want to stock it with desktops instead of laptops. Laptops cannot be upgraded like a desktop can. This means that they become obsolete quicker than a desktop computer. While you can usually upgrade the storage or the memory, you cannot upgrade the processor or video card, which will eventually leave your laptop lagging behind. Laptops get heated very quickly if you are using it heavily. Laptops are hard to build yourself. One of the benefits of a desktop PC is that you can build it yourself, potentially saving money. While you may be able to find a few kits, nearly all laptops are sold complete by the manufacturer, which means the costs may be a little higher than a comparable desktop.  , It will be helpful to have a budget in mind as you start looking at laptop models. The different types of laptops will be explained in-depth later, but generally you're looking at around $300-$400 for a netbook or Chromebook, $500-$1200 dollars for a standard laptop, and $900-$2500 for a desktop replacement.   If you are considering a Mac, be aware that Macs are generally priced higher than a comparable Windows or Linux laptop.  , The operating system is the interface and structure of your laptop. Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and ChromeOS are all operating systems. When choosing a laptop, the operating system is usually installed already, though you can change operating systems later. You cannot install Mac OS X on a non-Mac laptop, but you can install Linux onto either a Mac or a Windows laptop, or Windows onto a Mac laptop.   Windows - The most common operating system available, and compatible with the most software. Mac OS X - Designed for use with Mac hardware. OS X is only available on MacBooks. Linux - This is a free operating system that comes in a variety of flavors, or ""distributions"". These include Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, and more. ChromeOS - This is Google's Chromium-based operating system. It is designed for laptops that are consistently connected to the internet, and can only run special web apps. ChromeOS is only available on specific Chromebooks, though you can get Chromium for any system.  , The programs you use on a day-to-day basis will have a large impact on the operating system you choose. Many programs are only available for a single operating system. Do some research as to what operating system your favorite programs require, if you'll have to pay again if you switch operating systems, and whether or not there are alternatives available.   If your business uses operating system-specific programs, that may limit your options if you intend to use the laptop for work.  , Windows is the most widely-used operating system, which is great for compatibility, but it's not without its faults. Keep the pros and cons in mind when thinking about your new laptop.   Windows is the most common and compatible operating system around. Office is the de facto standard in word processing and spreadsheets. Windows will work on virtually any computer, from the cheapest laptops in the store to the most expensive. Windows is much more susceptible to viruses than other operating systems. This isn't to say that it's not secure, it just means that you will need to practice good habits while online. Windows has the largest game library of any operating system.  , These days, you can find much of the same software on a Mac OS that you will on Windows.   If you are a heavy Apple user, a Mac computer will integrate seamlessly with your iOS devices. Managing your apps and media is all handled natively. They are less prone to viruses. Mac operating systems are more secure than Windows, due both to architectural and population differences between the two operating systems. There are still threats if you use a Mac, just not as many. While there are more and more software options on Mac, there is still a lack of compatibility for a lot of key programs. The biggest drawback is OS X's lack of game selection compared to Windows, though more and more Windows games are being ported over. Macs are regarded as the best place to do media editing. The video and image editing software on a Mac is unrivaled, and most musicians use Macs for recording and production. Mac hardware will cost you a pretty penny. Since getting OS X requires Mac hardware, you'll be forced to buy a MacBook from Apple or an Apple-authorized retailer. This means you'll be paying a premium price, but many Apple users are major supporters of the construction quality of their MacBooks. The actual price of the operating system is much cheaper than Windows.  , Linux is a free, open-source operating system that has been modified and expanded by a large number of groups and individuals. These modified versions are called ""distributions"", and there are quite a few to choose from. There's a good chance that you won't see many, or any, Linux laptops at your local computer retailer.   Linux is a free operating system, and many of the programs available for it are open-source and free. You are free to try out any Linux distribution before installing it. Linux is notorious for being difficult to learn. Advances to the graphical front-end have been made by most distributions, making it easier to transition from Windows or Mac. That being said, Linux does require a bit more time invested getting used to navigating and manipulating files. Linux is one of the most secure operating systems, as everything requires express consent of the user. There are very few viruses that target Linux machines. Linux scales very well and can work on virtually any laptop. You will experience compatibility problems. The biggest drawback to Linux is the lack of compatibility between it and other operating systems. You will likely find times when you need to jump through several hoops to open a file that was simple in Windows or OS X. The gaming library on Linux is also quite limited compared to Windows, though more and more games are releasing Linux versions. Linux is not installed on most laptops available in stores. It will need to be installed later alongside or replacing your default operating system.  , ChromeOS is Google's operating system, and is only available on a handful of laptops. ChromeOS is designed for laptops that are always connected to the internet.   ChromeOS is lightweight and fast. This is because ChromeOS is essentially just a web browser. All the apps are installed inside the web browser. Because of this, most of ChromeOS's functionality requires an internet connection (you can do some work offline, such as working with Google Docs).Most Chromebooks are very inexpensive, ranging from $200-$250 USD. The exception to this is Google's Chromebox, which starts at $825 USD. Because Chromebooks rely on Google Drive for file storage, most have very limited onboard storage. You can only use apps that have been designed for ChromeOS on the Chromebook. This means that your software options will be very limited. Google Drive provides a decent Office alternative, but you can forget installing games or programs like Photoshop. ChromeOS is best for heavy Google users. If the majority of your computer work takes place inside the Google ecosystem, then a Chromebook may be your most affordable and attractive option.  , There are four main types of laptops: Netbook, Standard, Hybrid Laptop/Tablet, and Desktop Replacement/Ultrabook. Note that if you are choosing a Mac, your choices will likely not match much of this section.Netbook - This is the smallest laptop available, and is best suited for heavy travelers. Standard - This is your standard laptop. Suitable for a wide range of situations, and available in a wide range of configurations. Hybrid Laptop/Tablet - These are the newest style of laptops to the scene. They have touch screens and some have detachable keyboards. Desktop Replacement/Ultrabook - These are the largest laptops, and therefore the most powerful (and most expensive).  , Netbooks are the smallest laptops available, and are perfect for packing in your carry-on or sticking in your purse.   Netbooks are super lightweight, usually only weighing a couple pounds. Netbooks don't have very powerful components, meaning they can only run basic programs such as Office and other productivity software. Because of this, however, they have much longer battery life than other laptops (up to 12 hours in some models).Netbooks have the smallest screens and keyboards. This means that typing on a netbook will take some getting used to, and you may have to sit pretty close to it.  , The standard laptop is the most common, and the most varied.   Standard laptops come in a variety of screen sizes. The size of the screen is what determines the overall size of the laptop. The most common size for standard laptops is 14""-15"". Standard laptops have limited battery life, and the more powerful the laptop, the quicker the battery will drain. Batteries will also wear out over time. Standard laptops are heavier than a netbook, which makes them harder to fit in small bags. They have more comfortable keyboards and larger trackpads.  , Hybrid laptops are a relatively new addition to the laptop market. Most run Windows 8, which is designed for the touch interface.   The biggest draw of the hybrid is the touch screen. If you prefer this method of input, you may want to consider the hybrid. Hybrid laptops are typically smaller than a standard laptop, and may be able to fold over to become a tablet. Some hybrid laptops allow you to remove the keyboard and work solely as a tablet. Because of their smaller size, hybrids are generally less powerful than a standard laptop.  , Desktop replacements are the largest and most powerful laptops available. They can run the latest games and have large, easy-to-see displays.   Desktop replacement laptops provide the most power you can get in a portable form. They can often run most of the same programs at the same levels of efficiency as a desktop computer. Because of the increased power, desktop replacements have the worst battery life. This usually isn't an issue if it's always plugged in at your desk, however. The large screen on a desktop replacement means that you don't have to sit as close or squint, and also means that the keyboard will be full-sized. Some desktop replacement laptops have limited upgradability, such as the ability to install a new video card. Desktop replacements are the most unwieldy laptops, and do not travel as well. They are also the most expensive.  , If your job or lifestyle puts your laptop at risk of getting damaged, you may want to look at the most durable options. This includes steel construction and laptops specifically designed to withstand punishment.   Toughbooks are a type of laptop that is very expensive but much more resilient than a standard laptop.  , Laptops are public devices, and will be seen by a lot of people as you use it. Make sure you like the way it looks. Many laptops come in various colors or with other aesthetic features. You can also add skins to your laptop later to give it a personal touch.  , Every laptop is different; even two models that cost the same will have different hardware inside. Make sure to take a look at the specifications of each laptop you consider purchasing.  , The CPU, or Processor, is the piece of hardware that performs the bulk of the work in your laptop. CPU speed doesn't mean as much as it used to, thanks to multi-core CPUs that can handle much more than processors from a decade ago.   Avoid older processors like Celeron, Atom, Pentium, C-, or E-Series processors.  , RAM, or Memory, allows your computer to store data for multiple programs at once. In general, the more RAM you have, the better your computer will be able to multitask. 4 to 8 GB of RAM is standard for regular laptops. Netbooks will likely have less, while desktop replacements might have significantly more.   Retailers often disguise an otherwise mediocre laptop by stuffing it with RAM. Most users will not need more than 8 GB.  , Most laptops use integrated graphics cards, which are fine for simple games, but typically can't handle the new big releases. A dedicated card will provide more power for a higher cost and less battery life.  , Listed storage space does not take the operating system and bundled programs into consideration. For example, a laptop with 250 GB of storage may only have 210 GB of storage free when you purchase it. Most laptops allow you to upgrade the hard drive later, though you will need to reinstall the operating system when you do so.   SSD is becoming standard and is preferable due to increased access speed and extended battery life. As a result SSDs are more expensive than standard hard drives for less storage. SSDs are often smaller than standard drives, meaning you may need an external drive to store all of your media files.  , Does the laptop have enough USB ports for all of your devices? Does it have an HDMI or VGA port in case you want to connect it to your TV or a projector? If you use a lot of external devices, ports will be very important.  , Many laptops will leave the optical drive out in order to save space. While this will help the battery life and cut down on the size, it means you will need an external drive in order to install software or burn discs.   Some laptops now come with Blu-ray drives, which can read and write standard DVDs as well as read Blu-ray discs, which can contain much more information or HD movies.  , 1600 x 900 or 1920 x 1080 is preferable for the clearest picture, though smaller laptops may not be able to attain this. A higher resolution will result in a clearer picture, especially if you plan to watch movies or play games. A higher resolution also means that the screen can display more, which means your viewable area will be larger.   Determine how the laptop looks in direct sunlight. Cheap screens are often very difficult to see in direct sunlight.  , Don't let a sales rep talk you into something you don't need. Do your research ahead of time and stay firm on your needs. Make sure to read reviews online for the laptops that you are considering, as salespeople will rarely tell you the downsides of a product.  , Try to find a way to test your desired laptop before you buy. If you intend to buy online, see if a local retailer has a demo model to try before you buy. Ask your friends if they have the same laptop you are considering.  , Computer parts fail, and do so fairly often. Having a solid warranty is very important for laptops, especially the more expensive ones. Make sure the warranty is a manufacturer warranty, and that they do a good job with their warranty work.   Craigslist laptops rarely have warranties.  , Buying used can save you a lot of money, but you may end up with a very subpar product. AS laptops get older, they start to experience significant performance decreases. Used laptops often no longer quality for manufacturer warranties, and may people sell their laptops because they're fed up with how they're performing.   If you are buying a refurbished model, ensure that the refurbishment comes with a very strong warranty.

"['identify the type of alimony you pay', 'check if you can modify your alimony', 'identify a substantial change in circumstances', 'document that your ex-spouse refuses to work', 'meet with an attorney', 'obtain court forms', 'complete the petition', 'assemble your forms', 'file your paperwork', 'schedule a hearing', 'serve the paperwork on your ex-spouse', 'wait for a response', 'file for a default judgment', 'if necessary', 'prepare for your hearing', 'gather witnesses and supporting documents', 'dress appropriately', 'present your evidence to the judge', 'listen to your ex-spouse present their side', 'receive the judge’s order']",How to Modify Alimony when a Supported Ex Refuses to Work," Not all alimony is the same. The type of alimony you pay will determine when and how you can seek to modify it. Take out your divorce decree and read it to see what type of alimony the judge awarded:Rehabilitative alimony. A court often grants this kind of alimony to allow a spouse to get an education in preparation for entering the job market. Rehabilitative alimony is set for a limited amount of time. At the end of this period, you can ask the court to review. Permanent alimony. As the name implies, this type of support is meant to be permanent. You will probably need to identify a “substantial change in circumstances” in order to modify this type of alimony. Reimbursement alimony. This type of alimony is meant to compensate a spouse who worked full-time to put a spouse through school. Sometimes, reimbursement alimony is given as a lump sum. It will be very hard to modify this type of alimony because your ex now refuses to work. Instead, this type of alimony was awarded as a reward for his or her past work.; , Your ex-spouse’s refusal to work should have been relevant when the judge set the initial alimony amount. However, now you want to modify alimony, probably by reducing it. You don’t generally have a right to modify alimony. Instead, you need to check the following:   Your marital settlement agreement. If you agreed to pay alimony as part of a divorce settlement, then you might not be able to modify. It depends on what your settlement agreement says.For example, you might have agreed that alimony would be non-modifiable. Your divorce decree. If the alimony is short-term rehabilitative, then the judge might have set a deadline for your ex-spouse to get a job. If so, then you can raise your ex’s refusal to work at the court hearing. However, make sure that the judge didn’t state that the alimony was non-modifiable.  , In many states, you can also modify alimony when there has been a “substantial change in circumstances.” The more circumstances you can point to, the better. You should look for the following, which will help you make a strong case to the judge:   Your ex’s financial position has improved. For example, he or she could have inherited money from relatives. You can also argue that he or she should be working because they completed a degree or have had offers of employment. Your ex has moved in with someone. Usually, alimony will end when your ex gets married. In some states, it may be reduced when your ex-spouse cohabitates with a partner.You have lost your own job. You may be facing difficult financial circumstances that make modifying alimony appropriate. You should get proof that you were laid off, such as a termination notice from your employer. You have retired. You can usually get a reduction in the alimony you pay when you retire.You have suffered a medical or another crisis. You might be able to get a modification if you have become suddenly ill and have high medical expenses or have been unable to work as much as you used to.  , You should have proof that your ex-spouse has the qualifications to find a job but has refused to get one. It’s okay if you can’t find hard evidence. After filing for a modification, you can seek “discovery,” which is a way to get documents and other information from your ex-spouse.However, for now, you should look for the following:   Proof that your ex has completed a degree. Look on the university or college’s website. Often, the name of graduates is published. Information about your ex-spouse’s job history. As best as you can, write down what you remember about when and where he or she worked. Also write down how much your ex made in these jobs. Evidence your ex has turned down jobs. For example, friends or family might still be in contact with your ex and tell you that they have turned down job offers.  , Each state’s alimony laws are different. Accordingly, only a qualified attorney can properly advise you about the alimony laws in your state. An attorney can also tell you whether you may seek modification because your ex refuses to work.   You can find a divorce attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Ask for a referral. If you used a lawyer for your divorce, then reconnect. Call him or her up and explain that you want to modify your alimony. Also think about hiring the lawyer to represent you. If your ex-spouse has a lawyer, then you will be at a disadvantage if you don’t have one.  , You need to ask a judge to modify the alimony award. You can do so by filing certain paperwork with the court. You will need a “petition” or “complaint.” You will also have to fill out other forms, such as a “financial affidavit” or “financial statement.”Most courts have “fill in the blank” forms you can use.   Stop into the court where you received your divorce decree and ask the court clerk for the forms. Tell him or her you want to modify alimony. You can also look on the court’s website.  , One important document is the petition. You should provide the requested information neatly, using black ink. Each court’s petition form differs slightly from other court’s forms. However, you will typically be asked for the following information:names (of you and your ex) date final judgment was entered in your divorce how much you currently pay in alimony circumstances that warrant modification how you want the alimony modified your signature (given under penalty of perjury) signature of a notary public  , Once you complete all of the forms, put them in order. The forms might tell you the order to assemble them. You also will need to provide a copy of your original divorce decree or settlement agreement.   Make several copies of the entire packet when you are finished. You will need one copy for your records and another copy to send to your ex.  , Take the original (and the copies) to the court clerk. Ask him or her to file.The clerk can stamp your copies with the filing date as well.   You may have to pay a filing fee.The amount will differ depending on the court. If you can’t afford the fee, then ask the clerk for a fee waiver application.  , The judge probably requires a hearing before he or she will make a decision on modifying alimony. Each court schedules hearings in different ways. In some courts, you should ask for a hearing date when you file.   In other courts, you should wait until you hear back from your ex before deciding whether a hearing is necessary., You should serve a copy on your ex-spouse by hand delivery, which is called “personal service.”You can typically hire a private process server, who will make delivery for $45-75. Look in the phone book or online.   You can also usually have someone 18 or older hand deliver the papers, so long as the person isn’t involved in the dispute. For example, you could have a friend take them over. Whoever makes service usually has to complete a “proof of service” or “affidavit of service” form. You can get this form from the court clerk. The server fills it out and returns it to you. Make a copy for your records and file the original with the court.  , Your ex has a certain amount of time to respond. If they do, they typically will file an answer to your petition. In this document, they will respond to all of the allegations made in your petition.   Your ex should deliver their response to you. If you have a lawyer, then he or she will get it. Ask your lawyer for a copy so that you have copies of all important documents filed in your case.  , Your ex might not respond. In that case, go to the clerk’s office and state that you want to file for a “default judgment.”Ask for the proper forms and fill them out.   With a default judgment, you win because your ex refused to respond in time. Default judgments aren’t available in all situations or in all courts. However, you can still check with the court clerk.  , Your judge may require a “case management conference” or other hearing in order to hash out preliminary issues. For example, you can request discovery if need be. You may also be ordered to attend mediation.You might have to attend a series of “status” hearings to discuss how the case is coming along and handle any issues that arise. The purpose of these hearings is to make sure that everyone gets the information they have requested in preparation for the full hearing on whether to modify alimony.  , Generally, you can have witnesses testify at the hearing on your behalf. For example, you might want someone to testify that they offered your ex a job but he or she refused. You can tell the witness the hearing date and time. You might also need to send them subpoenas, which you can get from the court clerk, to secure their attendance.   You should also identify any documents you want to introduce into evidence.For example, if you have a copy of a written job offer that your ex turned down, then you may want to introduce that into evidence.  , You want to look good for your hearing. However, you don’t want to look “too good.” You don’t want the judge to think you are drowning in money.Accordingly, you should follow these fashion tips:   Dress in “business casual.” Men can wear dress pants and a button-up shirt. Make sure the shirt is long-sleeved and has a collar. Tuck it in at the waist. Men can also wear ties and dress shoes with dark socks. Women should wear dress slacks and a nice blouse or sweater. Leave the jewelry at home.  , You will go first (since you are asking the judge to modify alimony). You should explain why the alimony should be modified. For example, you can present evidence that your ex isn’t looking for work although he or she received temporary, rehabilitative alimony and has received training or a degree.   The judge may ask you questions. You should listen quietly when the judge is speaking.  , You have to be quiet as your ex presents their evidence. They should explain why they can’t look for work and/or why the alimony should be extended. Don’t interrupt.   You probably will be able to cross-examine your ex and their witnesses, so you should write down questions you want to ask on a piece of paper., After hearing all evidence, the judge will make a decision and sign an order.In some courts, the clerk will fill out the order. However, in other courts, the winning side needs to complete the order.   Make sure you get a signed copy of the order and keep it for your records.  ",1845,"['alimony', 'ex-spouse', 'circumstances', 'witnesses', 'attorney', 'forms', 'type', 'court forms', 'side', 'hearing', 'default judgment', 'petition', 'response', 'substantial change', 'order', 'evidence', 'paperwork', 'judge', 'documents']"
"['lift the dust cover from the turntable', 'remove the dust cover from the platter', 'make sure the turntable is not spinning', 'place the record on the platter', 'put the platter into motion', 'lift or cue the tonearm', 'position the tonearm above the beginning of the record', 'lower the stylus onto the record', 'put the tonearm back into place when the record is over', 'get a receiver', 'attach all the cables', 'switch to the correct input', 'keep dust off your turntable and needle', 'operate your turntable correctly']",How to Operate a Turntable," Turntables are usually fitted with plastic dust covers to keep the components clean when not in use. If you have a hinged dust cover, you can lift the cover and then gently lower it again once the record is playing. If your cover is not hinged, you should set it aside until you are done using the turntable. Placing it down while a record is playing can damage the player and record.; , The platter is the circular platform which you will place your vinyl record on. Sometimes there is a second dust cover, usually made of felt, that rests over the platter.   Lift the circular felt cover off the platter and place it somewhere where it won’t attract much dust. You can store the felt cover inside of the record’s jacket while your record is playing. Though you may have a plastic cover, it is always good to use both when not using your turntable. Using both will ensure no dust or scratches occur and damage any components.  , Some turntables will have a switch to start the rotation of the platter. Others will automatically start when the needle drops. In either case, make sure your record player isn’t spinning and the needle is up.          If you place your vinyl record onto the platter while it is spinning you risk scratching the record.  , Again, the platter is the round platform on which the vinyl record rests during play. Holding the record only along the record’s edges, lower the record onto the platter.         Place the spindle in the center of the platter through the hole in the record. Lower the record until it is resting flush on the platter. Always hold your records by the edges and don’t touch the grooves of the record. When removing a record from the jacket, you may have to briefly grab the playing surface. Only touch the very outer portion where the grooves are not present to pull it out. Quickly transfer your grip to along the edges. The oil from your fingers can get onto the surface of the record and affect the sound as well as attract dust and cause scratches. The platter on most turntables will be made from metal, but should be fitted on top with a foam or rubber mat. This mat cushions the record during use, and you should never operate a turntable without a mat in place.  , Control setups will vary between turntables. But, most will have a switch that allows you to engage or disengage the motor driving the platter.          In some cases, this switch will be integrated with the speed selector; for example, the 3 switch positions may be ""off,"" ""33 rpm,"" and ""45 rpm."" In other cases, you may need to select the speed using a separate switch or by repositioning the drive belt manually. Standard 12 inches (300 mm) records should play at “33 rpm.” On automatic turntables, the platter may be designed to start rotating when the tonearm is lifted towards the platter. In this case, you will not need to deliberately put the platter into motion.  , Many turntables will have a cueing feature that allows you to simply engage a switch that lifts the tonearm from its rest automatically. This process is called ""cueing."" Some turntable will have a cue lever which is used to raise and lower the arm.          If you don't have a cue switch, gently lift the tonearm from its rest by placing your finger underneath the handle on the head shell. Or use the cue lever. Ensure that the cueing lever (if there is no switch), a small arm usually located at the base of your tonearm, is up. The cueing lever is what lowers and raises the tonearm. You need the cueing switch or arm to be up so that your tonearm doesn’t fall onto the vinyl when you move it from the resting position and over your record.  , The needle of the tonearm needs to be positioned directly over the outermost grooves in the record. You should see a few widely spaced grooves on the outer perimeter that indicate the area before the recording begins.          If your turntable has a cueing feature, you can gently push the tonearm into place with your fingers. It will rest above the record until you disengage the cueing switch or lever. If your turntable has no cueing switch, you will move the tonearm over the record by using the handle on the head shell.  , The tonearm should be lowered very gently onto the outer grooves of the vinyl record. The stylus should engage the grooves with minimal popping or clicking sounds. The recording should begin shortly after the stylus is lowered.          To lower the tonearm using a cueing lever, simply disengage the switch or lever by lowering it down. The tonearm will gently lower itself and the stylus will engage the record’s grooves. To raise the tonearm, raise the cueing switch. Without a cueing switch, you will have to manually lower the tonearm onto the record. Be as slow and steady as possible when doing this. Lowering the stylus too violently can damage both the stylus and the record.  , When you are done listening to the record, you need to lift the tonearm from the record and place it back into its resting position.          Lifting the tonearm can either be done by engaging the cueing switch or by manually and gently lifting it from the record's surface. On some fully automatic turntables, the tonearm will return to place automatically once the record is over. Make sure that the tonearm is back in resting position before stopping the platter from spinning. The tonearm shouldn’t be resting on a stopped record. This could apply excess pressure to the grooves and cause damage. To listen to the other side of the record, flip it over and repeat the above process. When done using the turntable, remember to replace the dust cover. Make sure the tonearm is in resting position and the platter isn’t turning. Then lift the record by the edges and flip it.  , A lot of record players require you to use a receiver to hook the turntable up to. The receiver then connects to speakers which will play the sound coming from the record.   Hooking your turntable into a receiver and then connecting the receiver to speakers is the most common setup. If you already have a receiver and speakers for your home entertainment system, you can hook your turntable into your existing equipment. To get the sound from your turntable to come out of your speakers you will need to set your receiver on “Phono”. Some turntables will also require an external phono preamp to be hooked up. A preamp is used to help amplify the sound being created by the needle on the record’s grooves. Some receivers don’t have the necessary inputs required to effectively connect the turntable. However, many modern turntables have a built-in preamp that allows you to connect to your receiver.  , Attaching your cables correctly to your turntable and your receiver or speakers is fairly straight forward.   There are often color coded cables to help you figure out where to put a certain cable. There isn’t only one way to attach all your cables as there are many different kinds of turntables and sound systems. Always keep your instruction manuals. Your instruction manuals for both your turntable and your sound equipment will guide you for your specific setup. When connecting all the cables make sure that your systems are turned off and unplugged. You don’t want to risk injury to getting shocked. Most turntables also have a small thin wire with a little crab claw-like metal tip. This wire is the “ground” wire. This wire prevents an unpleasant buzzing sound when playing. There will be a marked connection point on your stereo system, provided it can play phono. , Once it looks like your turntable and sound system is correctly hooked up, plug everything in and set your receiver to “Phono”.   The phono input is the one you need for your record to be heard. Because the sound isn’t coming from a digital source like from an iPod or CD, it is much lower. The phono setting, along with a phono preamp, whether external or built-in, amplifies the sound.  , To prevent any scratching or muddled sounds, make sure that you always keep your needle free of dust.          The small needle at the tip of your tonearm often collects dust very easily. If your needle has a dust cap, be sure to place it on after every use. If there is dust on your needle, you will need a stylus cleaning brush and turntable cleaning solution or rubbing alcohol. Dampen the stylus brush and gently wipe the styles from front to back. , Always take the necessary steps to operate your turntable and records correctly. Though it may take more time, it’s worth it to preserve your equipment.          Always remove and replace any dust covers before and after each use. Don’t start spinning the platter before you place your record down. Likewise, always wait for the platter to completely stop before removing your vinyl otherwise you may scratch it. Operate your tonearm and needle correctly. Never drop or abruptly remove the needle. Always use the cueing arm. Don’t get your fingerprints on the surface of the records. Always hold by the edges. Store records vertically in a dry location. Humidity and stacking records on top one another will cause records to warp. Always put a record away as soon as you are done listening.

While it's impossible for anyone to have flawless skin, especially in their teen years, follow good skin-care routines to keep your skin looking its best.   Everyone gets acne at some point, and you can choose whether or not to hide it. It's okay to not look picture-perfect every day, but do what makes you feel most comfortable.; , Some genki girls have normal hair that they leave hanging down, and it can be curly, wavy, or straight. However, some style their hair in different ways, and some have hair that most people think must be dyed! You can choose to style your hair however you want, whether it's left down or dyed; however, make sure you wash your hair at the very least. If your hair is prone to tangling, make sure it doesn't tangle up, either, as that can result in knotted hair, which can be hard to fix!  , It might be confusing to know how this relates to being a genki girl, but genki girls have to be healthy - otherwise, they can't fulfill the genki part (since that's what the word ""genki"" translates to!). If your body isn't functioning at its best, it'll be hard to be so energetic, so eat fruits, vegetables, grains, and protein to get the nutrients you need.   Drink plenty of water. This will keep your body in top-notch shape, and will also help with keeping your skin clear. It's okay to eat unhealthy foods once in awhile. Just do this in moderation. Your energy can't come from eating sugar all the time!  , It's very rare that you see a genki girl looking bad. Even when most people would be looking disheveled (for example, after having rolled out of bed in the morning), genki girls generally still look quite good, just a little bit more ""tousled"" than usual. Obviously, it's pretty hard to keep yourself looking good after an intense sports match or during your sleep, but do your best to at least look presentable, even if you are a tad messy.  , You don't need to be a fashion diva (unless you want to be, of course), but you should at least try to make your clothing look presentable. Wear clothing that's properly sized, don't force yourself to wear something you don't like or aren't comfortable in, and don't feel boxed in by constraints of normal fashion. If you want to wear something loud and flashy, that's your right!   That being said, in today's society, dressing in patterns that don't match or in a style that's not typical may cause people to make fun of you. You can either choose to wear something more conformist, or go all-out and not care what people think. Be careful with taking ""loud and flashy"" literally. Some clothing exists that lights up or makes noise, but this doesn't mean it's appropriate for where you're going all the time. Many genki girls would be considered cute, adorable, or some other term that would refer to a ""youthful innocence"". You can try modeling your style after this, but ultimately, how you dress is completely up to you.  , Genki girls are meant to be unique and not a whole lot of them stand out in terms of their appearance. Why not pick out something that's specific to you and you alone, to make yourself a unique, noticeable genki girl? Whether it's a specific hairstyle, a special accessory that isn't too common, or that same scarf with the wacky pattern that you've always secretly liked, finding something that's unique to you can bring you a step closer to being a recognizable genki girl.  , There are many types of genki girls all around anime and manga, and there's no way to act like every single one of them. There are the genki girls who go all-out and are noisy and energetic to no bounds, but there are also some more reserved genki girls who aren't nearly as loud and hyper (but still are quite happy and excitable). There's no way to emulate every genki girl out there, but there are general guidelines that you can follow in order to be a genki girl.   Don't mix up being a genki girl with being cheerful and optimistic. While genki girls are fairly cheerful, they need to have the extra energetic ""kick"" in their lifestyle to be considered a true genki girl.  , Quite a few genki girls are known for being unique and recognizable, and you should be unique, too! Develop your own style of dressing, talking, and behaving. Make yourself recognizable, so that people will know you and know that you're a genki girl.   You can also come up with a catchphrase, if you wish, since many genki girls (and anime characters in general) are known for having a catchphrase.  , Nobody recognizes a sad, negatively-thinking character as a genki girl, and being too harsh on everything will just drive people away from you. Stay positive and cheerful, even when it's hard. It's okay to have bad days, but they shouldn't completely dominate your feelings!    Be confident, too. Many characters who fit the archetype of being a genki girl are quite confident and have a ""we can do it"" attitude. They don't think they can do it, they know they can do it!  , Stress is unavoidable, but it's also important to have ways to manage it. Genki girls are excitable because of their natural bubbly personality, not because of their stress! If stress is a constant issue for you, it's important to find ways to deal with it so that it doesn't interfere with your cheerful, excitable genki nature.   If you're visibly stressed and others ask you about it, try saying something like, ""I've got ten tests today and I'm really not wanting to take them right now!"" with an air of cheerfulness to it. Be careful not to make it sound sarcastic, though!  , Genki girls are incredibly loyal friends, and often tend to make everyone else laugh and feel good. (In fact, that's one of the things that they tend to enjoy doing!) Do random acts of kindness for your friends (and even strangers), do your best to stay out of fights and arguments, and show your eagerness when your friends join you (such as by waving your arms or jumping up and down).   If you're in a romantic relationship, that's great, but remember not to abandon your friends and family for your partner. Genki girls are loyal to their friends and family first. (But don't completely ignore your partner, either!) Some girls don't have the best families or home life, and/or have bad friends. If this is the case with you, be cautious. You don't need to be blindly loyal to people who you dislike or who mistreat you just because this article said to be loyal.  , Not just in terms of walking, but in terms of life, too! Since genki girls are known for being energetic, do everything a little faster than you normally would, whether it's walking, speaking, or completing tasks. Make it look like you're always eager to get to the next task in the day.   Of course, don't rush tasks that require precision or may affect you in the long-term. You might think it fits your genki girl nature to study quickly, but you'll regret that decision when you get your test back and find out that you got a bad grade.  , While a comical quirk of genki girls is to run everywhere and swing their arms around wildly while doing so, you obviously don't need to take it to that extreme. However, being a little extra bouncy and animated in your movements is a great touch. Wave your arms around when talking, bounce up and down on your feet, put an extra spring in your step - the choice of how you display your energy is yours.  , A noticeable trait of genki girls is to speak louder than others do. Make sure not to shout, though! Just raising your voice slightly is fine. If you shout, you're likely to annoy people (and possibly hurt their ears).  , If your aim is to be loud and energetic, you'll want to make sure that people want to hear what you have to say, right? Developing a good sense of humor, and possibly a sense of wit, can make others much more interested in what you want to say - and keep in mind that being funny is a common trait of genki girls, too.  , Genki girls are known for being hyperactive, happy, and excitable, so if you currently feel the opposite of that, let it show. People who know you as being so cheerful and energetic will notice your change in pace and tone, and will take it seriously.   Obviously, if you never feel like being energetic, then this won't do much. You might be better off emulating another anime character archetype that doesn't require you to be so noisy.  , There are times when being hyperactive or loud just isn't appropriate for the situation. Being a genki girl isn't about being disruptive or disrespectful, so show respect when you need to and keep quiet when it's best for you to do so.   Avoid disrupting people at times when they're trying to focus (e.g. at school or work), or when they're trying to talk to people about something. This isn't funny to them, and it can even get you kicked out of public places. Generally, if you think behaving in your genki nature in the scenario would make people upset or angry with you, don't do it.  , You don't have to be happy all of the time - but having a smile on your face is a nice touch, whether or not you're a genki girl. It'll draw people towards you and let you know that being cheerful is one of your best aspects. That's the best part of being a genki girl.

It is written from left to right, lacks distinct letter cases, and is recognizable by a distinctive horizontal line running along the tops of the letters that links them together.A chart with the Devanagari alphabet is available here: http://www.omniglot.com/charts/print/hindi.pdf.; , Hindi has 11 vowels, some of which are indicated by the use of diacritic marks, or symbols added to the letters of an alphabet in order to show different pronunciations.Vowels in Hindi have two forms: one form for when they are used by themselves, and one form for when the vowel is joined to a consonant in a word.अ a and आ aa  अ does not change the consonant, so if you see a consonant without a modifying symbol, it will have this vowel sound.When आ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ा to the end of the consonant (for example, न na becomes ना naa when आ is added to it).   इ i and ई ee  When इ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ि to the left-hand side of the consonant (before the consonant). When ई is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ी to the right-hand side of the consonant (after the consonant).   उ u and ऊ oo  When उ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ु beneath the consonant. When ऊ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ू beneath the consonant.   ए e and ऐ ai  When ए is added to a consonant, you add the symbol े above the consonant. When ऐ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ै above the consonant.   ओ o and औ au  When ओ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ो to the right-hand side of the consonant (after the consonant). When औ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ौ to the right-hand side of the consonant (after the consonant).   ऋ ri  When ऋ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ृ beneath the consonant. This vowel isn't very common in Hindi and is only found in Hindi words of Sanskrit origin.There is also a detailed pronunciation guide for the vowels here: http://learn-hindi-online.com/hindi-alphabet/vowels.php.  , There are 33 consonants in Hindi.They are organized in the alphabet by how you use your mouth and throat to pronounce them. Because Hindi uses more consonants than English does, some of them have no direct equivalent in English.The (a) next to some consonants indicates that they are pronounced as aspirated (i.e., with a strong breath of air such as p in ""pit"" or ""puff"").   Velar consonants, pronounced by using the back of the tongue at the roof of your mouth (e.g., k or g in English): क k, ख k (a), ग g, घ g (a), ङ n  Palatal consonants, pronounced by raising the front of the tongue just behind the gums(e.g., j in ""job""): च ch, छ ch (a), ज j, झ j (a), ञ n  Retroflex consonants, pronounced by curling the tongue backward and touching the roof of your mouth just behind the gums (none exist in English): ञ t, ट t (a), ड d, ढ d (a), ण n  Flap consonants, pronounced by ""flapping"" the tip of your tongue toward the roof of your mouth behind your upper front teeth (e.g., the t softening in words like ""butter,"" which often sounds like ""budder"") : ड़ d and ढ़ d (a) Dental consonants, pronounced by touching the tip of your tongue behind the back of your upper front teeth (e.g., th in ""thin""): त t, थ t (a), थ d, ध d (a), न n  Labial consonants, pronounced by using the lips together (e.g., b in ""baby""): प p, फ p (a), ब b, भ b (a), म m  Semivowels are vowel-like consonants, such as the w in ""wet"": य y (as in ""young""), य r, ल l, व w or v  Sibilant consonants, pronounced by using the tip of the tongue to push air out in a hissing noise: श sh, ष sh, स s  Glottal consonants, pronounced by using the glottis at thee back of the throat: स h   , Hindi consonants have two basic different ways of pronouncing them: voiced and unvoiced. Reading explanations for these pronunciations may seem a little complicated, but don't worry; once you start trying to practice the sounds, you'll be able to feel the difference between voicing and not voicing.Voiced consonants are pronounced by vibrating your vocal cords.For example, voiced consonants in English include z in ""zoo"" and g in ""good"".  Unvoiced consonants are pronounced without vibrating your vocal cords. For example, unvoiced consonants in English include s in ""snap"" and k in ""kitten"".  , Hindi consonants also fall into two basic subcategories, unaspirated and aspirated. You can have unvoiced unaspirated consonants, unvoiced aspirated consonants, etc.Aspiration is another term for a burst of air released through your mouth. The only way to really understand how this works in Hindi is to listen to recordings.  , The Hindi alphabet may look a little alien to you, especially if you are a native English speaker, but with some practice, you'll be able to understand how to make all the Hindi letter sounds yourself.A video recording of the Hindi alphabet is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyG_594WOjE.   Once you have listened to the recording a few times, pause the recording and try to mimic the pronunciation of the speaker. Take your time and work your way slowly through alphabet.  , You may find it easier to learn the Devanagari script if you can see how it is written. There are several tutorials available online, but the one at hindibhasha.com is widely recommended by university language departments.  , Nouns are words for objects, places, emotions, animals, and people. In Hindi, all nouns have a gender: masculine (M) or feminine (F). The gender of Hindi nouns is essential for proper grammar and communication, so when learning Hindi nouns, you must also learn their genders so you can use the nouns correctly.A very general rule to determine the gender for a noun is words that end with the vowel आ aa are usually masculine and words that end with the vowel ई ee are usually feminine. However, there are many exceptions to this rule, so it's important to still learn the gender of every noun through memorization and practice.For example: The noun for boy is: लड़का larkaa (M) and the noun for girl is: लड़की larkee (F). So in the case of these nouns, the general rule of gender applies. On the other hand, nouns like केला kelaa - Banana (M) and मेज़ mez - Desk (F) or घर ghar - House (M) are all exceptions to the general rule of gender.  , Simple pronouns like “he, she, I, we, they” are key to communicating in any language, including Hindi. The pronouns in Hindi are:First person singular: मैं main - I First person plural: हम ham - We Second person singular: तू too - You (Intimate) Second person plural: तुम tum - You (Informal), आप aap - You (Formal)  A note on informal and formal pronouns: each pronoun is used based on the level of politeness in a conversation. Use the formal आप aap when meeting someone for the first time, talking to someone older than you or simply to show respect to the person you are addressing. Use the informal तुम tum when chatting with your friends or close relatives. Use तू too when you are in a very informal or intimate conversation, such as talking to your partner or to young children. It would be considered extremely rude in Hindi to use तू too when talking to a stranger or someone you barely know.   Third person singular: यह yah - He / She/ It / This Third person plural: वह vah - He / She/ It / That  In spoken Hindi these words are pronounced slightly differently: यह is pronounced yeh and वह is pronounced voh. Use यह yeh when talking about someone or something close to you, so if someone is standing right next to you, use यह yeh. Use वह voh when talking about someone or something further away, so if someone is standing on the other side of the street, use वह voh. When in doubt, use वह voh.   Third person plural: ये ye - These / They Third person plural: वे ve- Those / They  You will often hear वे ve being pronounced as the singular “voh”. The third person plural pronouns follow the same rules: ये ye for people / things close to you (in the distance sense) and वे vo for people / things further away. Note that both यह yeh or वह voh could mean either “he” or “she”, so there is no difference based on the gender of how you are talking to. You must rely on the context of the sentence to determine if a person is talking to a “he” or “she”.    , Verbs describe an action, occurrence, or state of being. Learn Hindi verbs in the infinitive form (in English, “to ___”), as verbs are conjugated by dropping the infinitive ending and adding other suffixes. Hindi infinitives end in ना naa.Examples of Hindi infinitives include: होना honaa - to be; पढ़ना pahrnaa - to read or to study; बोलना bolnaa - to speak; सीखना seekhnaa - to learn; जाना jaanaa - to go., Like nouns, verbs in Hindi must be conjugated to reflect grammatical categories such as number, gender, tense, and mood.For example, the infinitive verb होना honaa- to be, conjugated for number becomes:  मैं हूँ main hoon - I am हम हैं ham hain - We are तू है too hai - You are (intimate) तुम हो tum ho -- You are (informal) आप हैं aap hain - You are (formal) यह है yah hai - he/she/this is वह है voh hai - he/she/that is ये हैं ye hain - these/they are वे हैं ve hain - those/they are   There are three conjugations for gender in the present verb tense:  For masculine singular subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ता taa. For masculine plural subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ते te. For feminine singular or feminine plural subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ती tee.   Because Hindi verbs have many tenses, you’ll want to use a textbook or other reference materials to learn verb conjugations beyond the basic present tense. A good reference dictionary will also help you conjugate new verbs.  , Once you become more comfortable with Hindi nouns, pronouns, and verbs, you can move on to studying other elements of Hindi., Oxford University Press publishes the gold standard of dictionaries, the Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary.While smaller pocket dictionaries are fine if you just need to look up a word or two, invest in a more substantial academic dictionary if you are serious about more formal study.   There are also Hindi dictionaries online. The University of Chicago’s “Digital Dictionaries of South Asia” project includes a dictionary of Urdu and Classical Hindi., Start with basic words that will help you become familiar with how Hindi vowels and consonants work together to create a word or phrase. Focus on recognizing the Hindi words and the Devanagari script. The days of the week are:Sunday, Hindi word: Raveevaa, Devanagari script: Rरविवार Monday, Hindi word: somvaa, Devanagari script: Rसोमवार Tuesday, Hindi word: mangalvaa, Devanagari script: Rमंगलवार Wednesday, Hindi word: budvaa, Devangari script: Rबुधवार Thursday, Hindi word: guRoovaa, Devangari script:Rगुरुवार Friday, Hindi word: shukRavaa, Devangari script: Rशुक्रवार Saturday, Hindi word: shaneevaa, Devangari script:Rशनिवार  , Once you become familiar with the days of the week, move on to other basic Hindi words, keeping in mind the Devanagari script.Yesterday, Hindi word: kal, script:कल Today, Hindi word: aaj, script: आज Tomorrow, Hindi word: kal, script: कल Day, Hindi word: din, script: दिन Night, Hindi word: Raat, script: रात Week, Hindi word: haftaa, script: हफ़्ता Month, Hindi word: maheenaa, script: महीना Years, Hindi word: aal, script: साल Second, Hindi word: doosRaa Minute, Hindi word: mint, script: मिनट Hour, Hindi word: gantaa, script: घंटा Morning, Hindi word: saveRey, script: सवेरे Evening, Hindi word: shaam, script: शाम Noon, Hindi word: dopeheR, script: दो पहर Midnight, Hindi word: aadeeRaat, script: आधी रात Now, Hindi word: ab, script: अब Later, Hindi word: baad mey, script: बाद में  , Learning conversational Hindi is a great way to practice your alphabet skills and prepare you for lessons on basic Hindi grammar. Actually having a conversation in Hindi is the most important way to learn the language.   Find a friend in your language class or look online in language forums for individuals looking to practice their conversational Hindi. There are also recordings of basic phrases online that you can refer to.Focus on phrases like:Hi!, Hindi: Namastey!, script: नमस्ते Good morning!, Hindi: Suprabhaat, script: सुप्रभात Good evening!, Hindi: Shubh sundhyaa, script: शुभ संध्या Welcome! (to greet someone), Hindi: Aapka swaagat hai!, script: आपका स्वागत हैं। How are you?, Hindi: Aap kaisey hain?, script: आप कैसे हैं ? I'm fine, thanks!, Hindi: Mein theek hoon, shukriya!, script: मैं ठीक हुँ । And you?, Hindi: Aur aap?, script: और आप? Good/ So-So, Hindi: Accha/ Theek-thaak, script: अच्छा/ ठीक-ठाक Thank you (very much)!, Hindi: Shukriyaa (Bahut dhanyavaad), script: शुक्रीया (बहुत धन्यवाद)   Refer to this link for recordings of these phrases as well as more detail about their pronunciation: http://www.learning-hindi.com/convo. Don't be afraid to start speaking the language even if you only know basic vocabulary and grammar. The sooner you start, the faster you will pick up the basics of the language---learning Hindi is really a matter of practice and determination.  , There are several universities that offer free online lessons. Find audio and video lessons whenever possible so that you can hear the language being spoken.   North Carolina State University offers a series of 24 video lessons that include instruction on script, vocabulary, grammar, and culture, as well as exercises and quizzes.The University of Pennsylvania offers a series of 20 audio lessons that cover the basics of Hindi grammar., Once you become familiar with the basics of Hindi vocabulary and grammar, you'll need a more in-depth source to learn the more complicated elements of the language. Try to find a textbook that includes audio elements if possible.   Rupert Snell's Teach Yourself Hindi course and book is highly recommended for beginners and includes audio.  Elementary Hindi by Richard Delacy and Sudha Joshi comprises a textbook and workbook with audio CD. Sonia Taneja's Practice Makes Perfect Basic Hindi is a workbook full of exercises to help you build on existing knowledge and practice concepts such as conjugation.  , Fortunately, there is a wealth of online resources available in Hindi, including newspapers, blogs, and social media. There is also a tradition of Hindi literature dating back to the 760s CE, full of poets, philosophers, and religious writers.Dainik Jagaran is the most popular Hindi newspaper in India.Other important newspapers published in Hindi include Hindustan, Dainik Bhaskar, and Rajasthan Patrika. The BBC also has a BBC India site.The Parikalpana Award is an annual award given to Indian blogs, much like the Bloggie Awards in English.As in most other places, popular social media in India include Facebook, Linkedin, and Twitter.Visiting social media pages in Hindi will give you an accessible “in” to the language and to popular cultural topics. Prominent authors in Hindi literature include Chanda Bardai, author of the Prathviraj Rasau (12th century); Kabir (14th century), a devotional author; poet Ganga Das (1823-1913); novelist Munshi Premchand (19th century); Dharmavir Bharati (20th century); and novelist Jainendra Kumar (20th century).Children’s books can be a great place to start because they are written very simply and often include pictures. Learning-Hindi.com has a collection of children’s books online., India has a huge movie industry, popularly known as “Bollywood”-- it’s actually the most prolific film industry in the world, with over 1,000 films released per year. Indians LOVE going to the movies; more tickets are sold in India than in any other country (2.7 billion tickets per year).Many movies in Hindi are released every year, and thanks to online streaming services such as Netflix and content providers such as iTunes, you can watch many of them right from your own home. Watch them in the original language with English subtitles so you can practice your Hindi listening skills.   Important films in Hindi cinema include Mughal-e-Azam (frequently ranked the greatest Bollywood movie of all time), the comedy Golmaal, and the drama Kahaani.If you enjoy superhero movies, India has quite a few of them. Popular films include Krrish and Ra.One.   , If you live near a college or university, there will probably be a variety of cultural events hosted by international students. Many towns and cities with high Indian populations have festivals and other cultural events where you can meet new friends and learn about Indian culture. If there is an Indian or Hindu cultural center near you, you can check their events calendar or contact their organizer.   If there are no cultural events nearby, look around online! Wesleyan University even maintains a “Virtual Village” where you can explore cultural topics and read interviews with “villagers.”, Because so many people speak Hindi, the chances are good that you know people who can speak the language. Particularly if they live far away from home, people will often be happy to chat with you in their native language.   Websites such as meetup.com offer you the chance to find groups of people who are interested in leraning more about Hindi language and Indian culture. Meetup currently has 103 groups in 70 countries, but if there isn’t one near you, why not start your own? Try striking up a chat with someone in your local Indian restaurant or grocery store. Not only will you get practice with your language, you will learn more about delicious Indian cuisine!

Whether you were together for a few months or you lived together for years and shared pets, you have the right to your complicated emotions. Allow yourself to cry, reflect on the experience, and accept that it's really over.   Use this time to reflect. Write down your feelings in a journal and really get in touch with why you're feeling that way. Giving yourself time may help you get over the relationship faster. Some people like to set an ""end mourning date."" Of course, this doesn't mean that you'll be over the relationship at that point--but it does mean that you'll start making a conscious effort to move on.; , If you feel like crying in bed all day, go for it. If you want to cry or vent to a friend about all of your frustrations, do that too. Just remember to only do this for as long as you need to, don't rush out into a new relationship in a week just because your ex is or to make them jealous.  , It's natural for you to long for your ex and to wish he/she was still by your side--after all, you're used to having them around, even if it wasn't comforting all of the time. But you have to stay strong and remind yourself why the relationship is over.Though it may hurt, try thinking of a moment when you were deeply unhappy in the relationship. Write it on an index card or save it on your phone and and carry it around with you. Look at it whenever you're regretting your decision or wondering why you and your ex aren't together anymore.  , Bitterness, guilt and regret can make for a debilitating emotional cocktail when you're trying to get over a relationship. You can teach yourself to recognize bitter thought patterns, though, by writing them down and then later examining them to find your emotional triggers. If you can pinpoint the things that set you off running into an emotional swamp, you can learn to walk around it.   Read back over your journal as if it belonged to someone else. What is it that seems to set this other person off? What advice would you offer them? What should they avoid? Circle words or phrases that show up repeatedly. When you find yourself thinking of that word or phrase (maybe your ex's name, maybe a particular place or concept) interrupt yourself. Have a mantra or or a song prepared to recite or listen to as a way of interrupting yourself and rewarding yourself for avoiding that negative thought.  , Taking up smoking just because you're feeling angry about a relationship won't do anything to help you feel better about yourself. Indulging in self-loathing that takes the form of drinking or drugs will only draw out the grief process, because you'll have to start from scratch.   If it's a distraction you're looking for, why not make it a healthy alternative? Instead of smoking, try taking up bicycling, art projects, or picking up an old instrument you'd lost touch with.  , Stop texting or calling. Don't try to have an awkward mature lunch with your ex once a week when it's over. Though you may be able to be friends with your ex one day, it needs to be after you've learned to be separate. The potential for damage at this point is great, and communicating with your ex will make it much harder for you to let go of the relationship.   If you need to stop hanging out with your mutual friends for a while, do it. If you really want to see them, hang out with them by making special plans. You're not being cowardly by doing this--you're just protecting yourself. Likewise, find new social places to hang out--there are plenty of bars, restaurants, and parks to check out that don't have any emotional baggage. If you run into your ex, you don't have to run in the other direction. Be mature and say hello, but you don't need to stop to have a painful conversation.  , Though you may be tempted to log on to your Facebook to see if there are any pictures of your ex with a new cutie, this will only prolong your pain and may even make you feel a bit obsessive. Even if you're determined not to contact your ex on social media, you won't be able to stop wondering if he saw your latest photos or your latest post.Don't get on social media again until the thought of seeing your ex's photo doesn't make you feel an intense spectrum of emotions. Alternatively, try blocking or ""unfriending"" your ex. This can be a very tangible way of signaling that the relationship is over.  , Do a relationship spring cleaning. If you can't bear to throw them out entirely, put them in a garbage bag at the back of your closet. Even if the stuffed animal your ex won for you during your first date at a carnival is your favorite item, throw it in a bag with everything else.   If you have a few things that belong to your ex-- sweatshirts, books, electronics--return them immediately. You can have a friend drop them off for you to minimize the pain.  , Especially if you had been living together, get rid of old things even if they don't remind you of your ex. Move your furniture around, and add some plants for decoration and peace. Do whatever you have to do to make your space feel new. It's important and healthy to try not to keep too many things from your lives together., While you can't just pack up all of your things and move to Hawaii the second you break up with your ex--unless you're lucky--visiting relatives or a location you've never been will help make your world a little larger for the time being. This offers necessary perspective and is a good start to enjoying yourself and starting to do things that you want to do.  , When you're ready, it'll be fun to catch up, laugh, and get back to having long and intense conversations with your friends. Use your new free time to reconnect with old friends, strike up new acquaintances, or to turn an acquaintance into a friend.Do the things you couldn't do in your relationship. If your partner hated sushi, organize a group lunch at the best place for sushi in your town. If your ex couldn't stand going to live metal shows, get some friends together and head for the mosh pit.  , Especially if you've been preoccupied with your relationship, perhaps you haven't been able to spend as much time around your family as you might like. They'll be on your team and give you a chance to relax, reconnect, and even enjoy some home cooking for a change. Plus, spending time in your hometown might give you a chance to reconnect with childhood friends, old stomping grounds, and enjoy yourself.  , Instead of doing the same old things that you and your ex used to do, try pursuing a new interest, finding a new hobby, or by getting completely out of your comfort zone.   Explore your creative side. Try writing a song, composing a poem, painting or sketching. Express yourself in way you never had before but always hoped to try. Try a new form of exercise. Take that yoga or Zumba class you've always been wanting to try. Not only will exercising make you feel less stressed out and more centered, but you may find a new passion. Do something completely out of your comfort zone. Try a type of food you've never eaten before, go hiking even if you're not outdoorsy, or even go sky diving if you're feeling adventurous. Pick up a new hobby, like knitting, coin collecting, bird watching, or anything else that makes you feel calm and dedicated.  , Though staying busy with a flurry of friends and fun activities is a great way to take your mind on your ex, if you really want to let go of the failed relationship, then you have to be able to be comfortable with yourself. Eventually, you may even relish the opportunity for some solo time.   Take walks a few times a week. Connect with nature by exploring local parks or lakes. This is not only great exercise, but the perfect opportunity to reflect. Read. Get lost in a book and spend hours just reading with a cup of tea. Write. Write in your journal, or try working on a short story. See what you can learn about yourself just by writing.  , Don't try to look around for the next rebound opportunity the second that you break up. Instead, take the time to enjoy being single and doing whatever you want whenever you want it. Many people in relationships would love to be single--at least for a little while--so you should look at it as an adventure instead of as a problem.   If someone asks you out before you're ready, don't be afraid to tell them, ""It's too soon"" especially if you think you might be interested. You'll be doing both of you a favor by not rushing it. If there's something there, it should still be there later when you are ready.  , Part of being single is the thrill of serendipity. Who knows who you might run into at the grocery store or the library. Talking to new people is an important step in moving forward.  , Let your friend set you up with a mutual acquaintance or even set up an online dating profile. It's important to take it slow and have fun meeting new people without setting any expectations.  , If anything, what do you wish you might have done differently at the beginning of your last relationship? Here's your chance to start things off on the right foot.   Don't be afraid to speak your mind. If any ""deal breakers"" pop up in the first few dates, don't ignore them just because it feels good to be dating again.

Strip the speech down to its bare bones to determine what is most important to say, and in what order you should deliver those facts.This is the basic structure which you will build your speech around.   State your name in the very first sentence of your speech.This can be very straightforward: ""Good afternoon!/Good morning! My name is Deshawn Smith, and I am a computer programming student at the University of Arkansas."" If the introduction is work-related, mention your interests and your career goals together in the same sentence. This will save on time and convey that your personal interests can serve your professional goals.For example, ""I am working on an app that allows people to order pizza from their Twitter account."" You may want to mention your education or professional training background, if it is relevant and appropriate.""This is the fifth app I've designed. My second app, which helped people locate dog parks near them, won an award at my university.""; , Depending on the scenario, you may also want to mention any relevant hobbies or additional experience you have. Mentioning interests and hobbies could help cement your authority on a certain subject, or it could feel tangential, depending on the purpose of your introductory speech.   If you are explaining your passion or goal and how it helped formed your progression up to this point, that can help you tell a compelling story about yourself.For example, if you're writing a speech for your college speech class, you might want to explain how you got into computers at an early age and why they're important to you now as you pursue your career goals. If, however, you are introducing yourself to potential clients at a business lunch, they are probably not interested in your hobbies. They will want to know what you are doing right now and what your skills are. Try writing one draft with your experience/hobbies and one without, and run both versions by an objective listener who can give you feedback before your speech., If you are trying to make a good first impression in a professional context, it's important that your speech conveys your capabilities and skills. You can accomplish this without sounding self-congratulatory by tying your past accomplishments with your future goals and aspirations, letting others know that your anticipated contributions in the future are grounded in your contributions from the past.Highlight the qualities, skills and experience you have that are most relevant for the audience and occasion. For example, ""Because of my background in app writing and my extensive network of professional connections, I have a strong grasp of what today's young professionals are looking for. My apps offer convenience and immediate gratification."" You are trying to present yourself as a professional while making a strong and lasting impression. If you're trying to sell yourself to a group of new colleagues, you probably won't need to tell them about your family life, or anything outside of work that isn't directly relevant., Present yourself honestly, but do so in a way that makes your story stand out from all the rest. If you played an important role in a big project, mention that role. Go further by extrapolating what you have learned from the experience, and explain what ideas you have about how the project could be performed more effectively if it were to be repeated.   You can simultaneously demonstrate your skills and experience, while presenting yourself as a forward-looking person who is always learning and developing.For example, you could say, ""I spend a lot of time attending app conventions and conferences so I can learn what audiences are looking for. I pride myself on staying on the cutting edge of app design."" Try to tie this into your broader outline of your career goals and personal development.  , Some career service advisors recommend keeping your self-introductory speech as short as two or three sentences.Others suggest aiming for five to seven minutes in length.If it is not possible to make your speech this short, or if time permits you to give a longer introduction, you should still trim down your speech to be as concise, yet informative, as possible.   Make sure that if this is an assignment, you stay within the assigned guidelines. If your speech is supposed to be 3-5 minutes, a 7-minute speech and a 2-minute speech are equally inappropriate. If you are giving a brief introductory speech in an interview, be certain that you don't go over the recommended time.  , Remember that your speech is going to be spoken out loud, and your audience will not be able to go back and re-read your words if something is confusing. Deliver your speech in such a way that no one will be uncertain of what you are trying to say.Avoid long rambling sentences, and use direct and concise prose as much as possible. Think about your sentence structure carefully. Reading your speech out loud will help you determine when you have overly long sentences that need to be restructured.  , You should run through your speech out loud well before the actual introduction. Practice different inflections and experiment with how you pace yourself during the speech. You can practice alone by reading at first, but to get some feedback it's a good idea to perform the speech in front of a friend, family member or colleague.   Practicing in front of other people will enable you to gauge whether your speech captures the interest of your listeners. Think about which parts of the speech were successful and which parts weren't. Try to get as much detailed feedback as possible by asking specific as well as general questions after your speech.As well as saying ""how did you like the speech?"", ask specifically what parts were the strongest and weakest. Check that you delivered a clear message by asking your practice audience what they took away from the speech.  , Know what you're going to say, and how you're going to say it, well in advance. Although in some instances it is common practice to read from a piece of paper, try to memorize your speech and read it with minimal prompts. Presenting without reading a paper can create a stronger impression of control, knowledge and confidence. It will also help keep your audience's attention.   If you are staring down at a piece of paper all the time, the audience might struggle to truly engage with what you are saying. You can, however, bring an index card with bullet points, just in case you freeze up. You shouldn't write your whole speech on the card, just the main points you hope to cover. Think of the card as a point of reference, rather than a backup for your speech., If you are writing an introduction for yourself in a professional setting, you will probably choose a different message, and use different language, than if you were introducing yourself to peers in a casual setting.Before you get started on planning your speech, ask yourself the following questions:   Who is the intended audience? What is the purpose of my introduction? What are the expectations others may have?, If you had all the time in the world, you could probably think of a lot of interesting and relevant things to say about yourself. But the key to a successful self-introduction is being brief and to the point. That means you will need to decide what are the things that are most important or relevant for your listeners to know about you. You will need to deliver that information in the shortest possible length of time.Stick to one or two main points you want to convey about yourself. You can always add more if time allows it.Depending on the audience and function of your speech, you shouldn't allow the focus to become too narrow. For example, if you're introducing yourself to a crowd of prospective investors, you'd focus on your skills to build their confidence in you. If you're introducing yourself to a general audience -- say, for a speech class in college -- you can be a bit more wide-ranging. Remember that you're introducing yourself in general, and you want to present yourself as an interesting and rounded individual.That doesn't mean you should spend time talking about your love of baseball when you are introducing yourself in a professional scenario.  , Whenever you plan a speech, you should always be keenly aware of what your intended goals and outcomes are. Ask yourself what kind of message you are hoping to convey to your listeners. Is your self-introduction to network with others professionally, or just casually (with new friends)?   Are you hoping to win someone over to your point of view with this introduction, or to inspire/motivate someone to work hard under your leadership? All of these will affect the things you say in your introduction and the way you say them., If you find that you get especially nervous before making a speech, you might consider using relaxation techniques shortly before you're due to talk. Find a quiet place and take a few minutes to prepare yourself. Take some deep breaths, focus on your breathing, and count the seconds that pass as you breathe in slowly, then exhale slowly.You can also try some visualization techniques to help ease your nervousness and give you confidence for your speech. Imagine the way you will feel when you have finished delivering your speech and are met with smiling faces and resounding applause. Then channel that confidence into the actual speech you are about to deliver., It may seem like a minor point, but a slouching posture could make you appear less confident or less professional, and it may be distracting to your audience.Stand up straight and try to project a strong image. You may find it helpful to push your chest out and suck your stomach in a little to help you keep a straight back, but try to keep it natural-looking.Avoid crossing your arms or clutching your hands.Don't stare down at the ground or cling to the table or lecture in front of you. Make eye contact across the room in a measured and controlled way. Avoid lingering on one person, but also avoid darting your eyes back and forth restlessly. Try making eye contact with one person on the left side of the room, then one person on the right side of the room. Shift across the room, but in a controlled way that feels natural and relaxed., You don't want to drag out your speech, but you also don't want to stumble over your words or read so fast that nobody can understand you. Try to find a balance and speed that you are comfortable with. You need to speak slowly enough that everyone can follow along and understand what you're saying, but not so slowly that it makes your speech lag.   Aim for a comfortable, conversational pace of dialogue.Practicing your speech in front of other people, or recording it and listening back are great ways to judge the tempo of your speech.  , If you make a mistake while delivering your speech, don't panic. Apologizing profusely draws attention to your mistakes and makes them seem more significant. Instead, if you feel like you need to address the mistake, make a humorous remark and then let it go. This will show comfort and confidence.Self-deprecating humor can help you come across as humble and likable. For example, if you've accidentally skipped forward in your speech and have to circle back, you could say something like, ""And now I'm going to cycle back and tell you something I forgot before. If you wanted to get to know the ""real me,"" you're seeing it now!""You can also make a quick, humorous nod to your mistake and move on. For example, if you come out and you mess up the very first line, you could say something like, ""Wow, excuse me. Here I am so excited to tell you about myself that I've mixed up all my words. Let me try that again."" Don't be too self-deprecating, however. You are still trying to ensure people remember you for your strengths and competencies. Move on quickly.

Become familiar with your community and its needs. Read local newspapers and magazines to determine topics that appear to be of interest. It is important to get to you know community, both to prepare yourself for fundraising as well as issuing your grants.As an example, if you wish to support performing and visual arts in your area, you should become familiar with the arts organizations that already exist. Talk to managers of local theaters or art galleries. Ask questions about the needs that they have, and find out what sources of funding they already have. If your sources suggest that they are getting along fine already, you may wish to move in different direction. You can gather data about your community and its demographics by using the U.S. Census Bureau’s “Fact Finder.” This is a website that allows you to search for information about your community based on age, gender, ethnicity or a wide range of other factors.; , The mission statement is the guiding document for your organization. A mission statement should consist of no more than two or three sentences, which describe the purpose of your foundation and its future operations. If properly stated, it will help you focus your work and it will help describe your purpose for other possible donors. Everything that your foundation does should be guided by the mission statement.As an example, if you want to create a nonprofit fund to generate interest in the arts in your community, your mission statement might be, ""Our mission is to support local visual and performing artists by providing financial support and advice. We seek to partner with artists to support innovative ideas and generate interest in the arts by the general public.""  , The board is made up of other people, like yourself, with the goal of operating a grant-making foundation. You may select your own friends and acquaintances, or you might choose to advertise and accept applications. You will want to select people who are as passionate about the topic as you are. You will also want to select people whom you can count on to help you with the work that will be required., In general, grant-making foundations exist as one of two formats. These are the private foundation and the public charity. Both are beneficial, both provide essentially the same services, and both are non-profit. There are a few key differences in operation and preparation:A private foundation generally begins with a predetermined source of capital. This money generally may come from an endowment or bequest. The work of the foundation is then to determine how best to manage or invest this money, and how to issue grants to qualified applicants. A public charity is an organization that works to raise money for an identified public purpose. The organization usually seeks out donations from other established foundations or from members of the general public. These donations are then used as the basis for making grants to those who apply.  , Your board of directors should assist in creating the business plan. A business plan is an outline of the way that your foundation will operate. A good business plan is essential to creating a strong foundation. The precise format of the plan is not important. You can write it in whatever way works best for you. The information and planning that go into it, however, are critical. Working with the full board will ensure full buy-in by everyone., How will you advertise your foundation? This includes everything from announcing the creation and existence of your foundation (you want people to know who you are!), advertising to generate donations, and letting people know of the opportunity to apply for grants. You need to consider where you will market your foundation, what sources you will use, how you will pay for the advertising, and when to post any ads.If members of your board have experience in marketing, you can do this yourself. However, for this stage, you may wish to engage the services of a professional marketing agency.  , The strategic plan is the statement of your foundation’s essential goals, combined with the specific action steps that you will take to reach those goals. Each action step should define what will get done, who will do it, and what time line you want to apply for the step to get accomplished. A good strategic plan should be reviewed every few years to make sure that your goals are being met but remain challenging.The strategic plan is the section of your business plan that should address how you will award your grants. This is where you should decide your overall focus. Do you want to target individual, struggling artists with small grants of $500, for example? Or will you try to play a role in changing education by issuing million dollar grants to innovative school systems? You and the board need to make these decisions and address how you will convey your plan to the general public and to those who may become eligible for your grants.  , You need to decide, and write down, how your foundation will function. Who will conduct the day-to-day operations? Will you even have day-to-day operations, or will you only call the board members together once a year to review grant applications? If you wish to define a managerial system or hierarchy, this is the place to do so., How will your foundation pay for its operations? You need to account for everything, including salaries of any paid employees, advertising and marketing costs, and all business operations right down to how you will buy the stationery and postage to send out correspondence and decisions.If you will pay the operating expenses out of the foundation’s principal fund, you must determine the income (based on interest or investments) and make sure that it meets your expenses. Otherwise, you will continually lose money, and eventually your foundation will collapse. (This may actually be your business decision, if you only want the foundation to operate for a finite number of years. However, you should plan ahead and determine this.) You may choose to engage in some money-making activities during the year that are to pay the operating costs of the foundation. If so, you need to define what these will be, how they will function, and how much you expect to earn. Unless someone in your organization has a background in finance, it may be helpful to engage the services of a financial planner or accountant when developing your financial plan.  , You are allowed to operate a grant-making foundation without incorporating. However, creating a corporation is highly recommended. By incorporating, the foundation becomes its own legal entity and will be able to continue perpetually. You may choose to change careers or move away, or you could even die (eventually), and the incorporated foundation will be able to continue. Incorporating also has the benefit of removing any personal liability, so no one individual will not be responsible for the costs of the foundation., In most cases, the decision of location will be easy - you will incorporate in the state where you conduct your business and issue your grants. However, if you choose to operate on a regional or even national basis, you may wish to research the corporate laws of several states to determine whether any particular states have corporate laws that may benefit your organization. For example, different states have more or less strict regulations on filing annual statements. Different states may have tax laws that could create certain operating benefits.If you are not well-versed in researching corporate legal issues yourself, you may wish to hire a corporate attorney to help with this step. You can find a helpful resource with links to corporate information from every state at http://grantspace.org/tools/nonprofit-startup-resources-by-state?_ga=1.194418415.339665185.1481398348. By selecting your state, you will be redirected to specific information about that state’s corporate offices, as well as information designed to help start-up foundations in the state.  , Your secretary of state’s office will have a feature on its website for you to search for available corporate names. You must make sure that the name you select is not already used by any other organization. It must also be distinct enough that you will not be confused with any other organization already operating.Search the Internet for your state’s Secretary of State and the word “corporation.” You should find the links you need. In some states, the office may be called the Corporation Division, Business Office, or some similar title.  , The by-laws function in much the same way as the business plan that you have already drafted. The by-laws outline the operations of your foundation. By-laws are not required to be public documents, but if you choose to make them public, you may encourage more interest in your foundation. In particular, your by-laws should define the following:Size of the board and how it will function. Roles and duties of directors and officers. Rules and procedures for holding meetings, electing directors, and appointing officers. Conflict of interest policies and procedures. How grant monies will be distributed. Other essential corporate governance matters.  , The Articles of Incorporation is the public document that defines your foundation’s legal structure. The secretary of state’s office will have a link to a template form that you can use for this purpose. You may use the prescribed form or, in nearly all states, you can draft your own, as long as you include all the necessary information. In most states, the Articles of Incorporation are required to provide the following information (this is a general list; you need to check the specific requirements for your chosen state):Corporate name. Registered agent. Address of corporate office. Statement of compliance with section 501(c)(3) of the IRS tax code. This is to ensure your tax-free status as a charitable organization. (See IRS Publication 557 for more information on this topic, available at https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs.) Statement that the corporation’s activities will be limited to the purposes set out in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Statement that the organization will not engage in political or legislative activities prohibited under section 501(c)(3). Statement that, upon dissolution of the corporation, any remaining assets will be distributed to another nonprofit, government agency, or for another public purpose.  , The Articles of Incorporation is a public document. This means that you are required to file it with the Secretary of State’s office before your foundation can begin operating. The state’s website will give you instructions for filing. In many cases, you may need to submit multiple copies. You should always submit one extra copy, with a self-addressed stamped envelope, and ask the office to date-stamp and return it to you as proof of filing. Review the instructions on the secretary of state’s website to find the required filing fee as well. Without paying the fee, your incorporation will not be final., The document that you use to establish your tax-exempt status is IRS Form 1023. This form can be found at https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/applying-for-tax-exempt-status. There are actually three different versions of Form 1023. You may review them and decide the one that is most appropriate and helpful for your purposes:Form 1023. This is the standard form, which is applicable for all organizations. You can print the form from the IRS website, along with the instructions for completion. If you are experienced in completing tax forms, you may prefer this version. Form 1023-Interactive. This includes the form, along with helpful hints and links to other IRS publications, which may prove beneficial. If you are new to filling out tax forms, this is the version you should use. Form 1023-EZ. This is a streamlined version of Form 1023, which applies to some organizations. You should complete the worksheet, available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1023ez.pdf, to see if you qualify. In general, Form 1023-EZ applies to smaller organizations, with less than $250,000 in assets and expecting less than $50,000 in revenue over the course of the year. You can get all these forms online, or you can order any tax form by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (829-3676)., Whichever version of Form 1023 you select, you must complete it accurately and provide all the required information. Form 1023 requests information on the following areas of your foundation’s operations:Identification Organizational structure Statements of compliance with 501(c)(3) Narrative description of your activities Compensation of officers, directors and other employees Members who receive benefits History of the organization Past activities Detailed financial data Public charity status.  , The user fee for operating as a tax-exempt organization is either $400 or $850, depending on your organization’s average annual gross receipts over a four-year period. If you have been in operation for more than four years, then you will use the actual data from the past four years to calculate this figure. If not, then you can estimate your expected receipts.If your average annual gross receipts exceed $10,000, then you will pay $850. If not, then you will pay $400.  , An authorized representative of the foundation must sign the completed Form 1023. This will usually need to be an officer or director, in accordance with your Articles of Incorporation. Without an appropriate signature, the form will not be accepted and you will delay your tax-exempt status. Send the completed, all the accompanying documents and other supporting materials, and the user fee, to Internal Revenue Service, P.O. Box 192, Covington, KY 41012-0192.   If you are submitting your forms by express mail or other delivery service, then send your submission to Internal Revenue Service, 201 West Rivercenter Blvd., Attn: Extracting Stop 312, Covington, KY 41011.  , A private foundation is required to file IRS Form 990-PF as part of its annual tax return.

From here, you can view the set in its entirety and read the cards and their effects, and look for bombs, or threats that can win games.; , Once you give the set an initial look over, start identifying color combinations that are supported by the cards in the set. Magic has 5 different colors of mana, white, blue, black, red, and green; these different colors of mana are used to cast different colors cards. In a drafting environment, players are will usually not be able to obtain enough playable cards in a single color. In most cases, draft decks will consist of 2, or even 3 color combinations of cards, so is important to know what colors work well together in the Set. In order to do this, there are 2 simple ways to identify what colors are designed to work together in a set: non-basic land cards and gold, or multi-colored, cards within the set.   Above you see a gold card: Olivia, Mobilized for War, and a matching non-basic land: Foreboding Ruins. From the information on these cards, you can see that red and black is a supported color combination in SOI, since there is a card that requires both those colors, as well as a land that can produce both those colors in the set.  , Once you identify your color pair, you can expand further into the archetypes of the set. Archetypes are important, because certain cards that fit in the same archetypes are designed to have synergy. When 2 cards with synergy are put in a a deck together, the deck becomes more powerful than just a sum of its individual parts. If you read deeper into Olivia, Mobilized for War, you can see that she is a vampire, and has a mechanic that allows you to discard cards.   Looking at the black and red cards in the set, you can see other vampires, as well a mechanic called madness in the cards such as Falkenrath Gorger. Madness allows you to cast spells for cheaper, or with an extra effect when you discard the card, which work perfectly with Olivia's effect. The enchantment, Call the Bloodline, is another way to enable madness as well as create more vampires, while lightning axe provides cheap removal on top of allowing you to discard cards. From these cards, you have identified your archetype: Red/Black madness vampires. There are multiple archetypes in each of the different colors for any draft format. Since drafting packs has a high level of randomness, its good to take a look at a few archetypes, in case you never see any of the cards you planned on using for your original plan.  , Once you identify your archetype, you must consider deck composition. Every functional deck needs to follow 5 basic principles to succeed on a fundamental level: card advantage, removal, creature count, mana base, and mana curve.   Mana base is referring to your lands, such as the Foreboding Ruins you saw earlier, as well as mana accelerants. Picking these up will help prevent you from not being able to cast the spells you want to. Mana curve refers to picking up cards that are costed differently. This allows you to potentially drop spells on every turn, a 1-drop on turn 1, and 2-drop on turn-2 etc. also known as curving out. The most important card type in any draft are generally creatures. These cards are the ones that will protect your life total, as well as knock down your opponents' life totals and allow you to win. Making sure to pick up efficient creatures at different mana costs is instrumental to building a good draft deck. Removal refers to cards that can remove you opponents creatures. Removal is important to answer your opponents bombs, as being unable to deal with your opponents' big creatures can easily result in a loss. Different colors remove creatures in different ways. For example, red generally uses damage to outright kill creatures, as seen in your Lightning Axe card from earlier. Card advantage refers to ways to draw cards. Having access to more cards means you can keep casting spells. Once you run out of cards, its difficult to keep up with your opponents moves, so keeping hand count up is crucial to closing out games. Now that you know what card you need, look at the set and try to find cards that fulfill your needs as well as fit into your archetype. Corrupted Grafstone is a mana accelerant that works off your graveyard, which works well with discarding cards. Insolent Neonate and Asylum Visitor are vampire creatures that are 1 and 2-drops respectively, which can lets you drop them early and then curve into Olivia on turn 3 in an ideal situation. Tormented Voice is an excellent card that fills the dual purpose of refilling your hand, while also allowing you to discard for madness.  , Another important factor to deck building is composition.   In general draft decks are built from a minimum for 40 cards, are comprised of:  15-17 Creatures 6-9 Non-creature spells: sorceries, instants, enchantments, artifacts 16-17 Lands   Depending on your archetype, these numbers may differ slightly, but this serves as a good base.  , The mechanics of drafting boil down to 2 things, picking and passing. From each pack, players will pick one card and then pass that pack. The process for passing packs is pass to left for pack 1, pass to the right for pack 2, and then pass to the left again for pack 3.  , In every pack of magic cards, there is a spread of 1 rare, 3 uncommons, and 11 commons with a chance for an extra foil card. When evaluating a pack, the first card you want to consider is the rare. Cards at the rare level are often stronger in comparison to lower cards, and there are less of them in the draft since there is only 1 per pack. In some cases however, you will want to forsake the rare in favor of another pick, such as when the rare only functions in very specific situations or niche decks.   When evaluating cards, there are 2 factors to take into consideration: power and versatility. Some cards are extremely powerful, but require you to have other cards, or to build your deck in a certain way in order to function. Other cards have high versatility, and can function in a variety of situations, but sacrifice raw power. For creatures, a good test of strength is seeing power and toughness vs mana cost. creatures that pass the test have power and toughness equal to their cost, for example, a 4/4 for 4 mana. Another thing to consider is synergy with your previous picks. Sometimes, taking picks with high raw power early constrains you to make certain picks later in order to keep your deck balanced.  ,   The first pack in the draft can set the stage for entire deck, depending on what kind of pick you take first. Take this pack for example; in this pack, you are extremely lucky to have pulled 2 rares, because your pack contained a foil rare. On the left you have Sorin, Grim Nemesis who is an extremely powerful pick from this set. On the left, you have Tamiyo's Journal which isnt quite as strong, but is still an excellent rare in the draft, and provides card advantage which is a core function that every deck needs. When comparing the 2, Sorin is a winner in terms of power, but Tamiyo's Journal leaves you with all options open. Since this is the first pick of the draft, taking Sorin here will heavily influence you into taking black and white cards to build around him, where as the journal allows you to go in any direction you want based on the next few picks.  , Say you take Sorin as your first pick. Sorin is a 6 drop, which is pretty high, so you must find picks that will allow you to survive the early game and play your Sorin later. In drafting, 6 mana cost is fine to top out a curve, and you don't want to get too many high cost spells, lest you are unable to play any of your very expensive cards. Now what you need is some 1-5 drops so you have some plays in the early turns, and your opponents don't form an insurmountable lead before you can play you bomb (Sorin).  , Now that you know your own game plan, what are the other players around the table doing? this question can be answered be paying attention to what kinds of cards are being passed to you. Is there a good rare in a certain color passed to you on turn 2-3? Chances are the players on the side passing to you are not building those colors. Inversely, what is missing from the pack? If you never see any red or black cards, chance are there is high competition around the table to pick those colors.   Identifying what your opponents are doing can help you build a better deck by going into an archetype that not many players are drafting, which will let you pick up more pieces of the deck and build a deck that has more synergy.  , Sometimes, you have to abandon your first pick and change your plans completely. In the example, you were extremely lucky with the rares you opened, however, this might not be the case. Maybe instead of opening that game-winning bomb in your first pick, you open it in your second pack, after a whole round of drafting has already occurred. In this case, it might be worth it to abandon some of your earlier picks than to pass along a strong card just because it didn't fit into your original plan.   Splashing is a less extreme way to alter your plans. Say you were planning to build our R/B madness vampires but picked Sorin pack 1 pick 1. Sorin is Black and White, while the deck you are trying to build is black and red. However, due to Sorin's high power, you want to try and run him in your deck. Splashing refers to running Sorin in our Red/Black deck and including a couple white mana sources in order to accommodate him. These 2 dual lands allows you to tap for one of your mains colors (black/red) as well as providing a white source to cast Sorin.  , As you enter the late stages of the draft, look at the cards you have accumulated. Think back to when you were thinking about balancing a deck and deck composition and ask yourself some questions.   How is your curve looking? What are your different spell counts? Do you have the basic principles needed to make your deck function? What cards have you already picked? Based on the answers to these question, fill in the holes in your deck and really round it out.  , There are times, especially when you get down to the last picks in a pack, when you get passed a pack that has no good choices for you. In this situation, use information on what your opponents are doing. If you have identified what kinds of colors your opponents are in, you can take cards that they might need so you don't have to deal with those cards.  , Once you have drafted your entire pool, its time to put your deck together. The first thing you want to do is get organized, so take all your playable picks and layout your curve. Laying out your curve refers to sorting out your cards by mana cost. 1-mana cards together, 2-mana cards together, etc. Once you lay out your curve, count out how many cards you have. Your deck should aim to have 23-24 non-land cards, so you will have to make some cuts to get it down to size.  , Making cuts is based on a few criteria.   First and foremost is power. Some cards are simply more powerful than others, and demand a spot in a deck. With cards on either extreme of the power spectrum, you can easily decide what you definitely want to keep and what you want to cut. However, power alone is generally not enough to make all the cuts you need to make. Next you will consider your ideal curve, and try to make your deck conform to that. In general, a deck's curve should roughly resemble a bell curve, with low counts of cards that are extremely expensive or too cheap, and higher quantities in the mid range(2-4 mana) If you have too many cards in at any one cost, look to make cuts there. Finally is redundancy. If you have multiple cards that fulfill the same purpose within the deck, or even multiple copies of some commons, this is where you will make your final cuts.  , Once you have your cuts, its time to fill in your 16-17 land slots. This is done by counting up your cards of different colors. The ratio of basic lands should roughly match the ratio of the colors you are running. For example, if you are running 16 red cards and 8 black cards, your mana base should be approximately 10 mountains (red) and 6 swamps (black). This is also where you will utilize any lands that produce multiple colors that you picked up form the draft, in general you should look to replace the higher count lands with your dual lands.

Maybe you are in a friendship with someone that you really care about and want to become more, or you are in a relationship and are ready to show your partner that you love him. Either way, you don't want to jump into something without thinking over the results.Maybe kissing someone isn't a big deal to you, but when you kiss someone you love, it's usually more than just a casual flirtation. In this case, you want to make sure you are at a point where your words can match your actions, meaning you are committed to the relationship, or the prospective relationship. It could also be really sweet to tell your friend or partner that you love him along with your kiss. This really takes the relationship to the next level, but is very thoughtful and shows your partner that you care about him and are committed. If you are interested in kissing a close friend, because you realize you are in love with him, just remember to think about the possible results of this action. You don't want to ruin your relationship or make your friend feel awkward, so feel out the friendship to see if it is an appropriate time. They key to knowing if you are in love with someone may be that you are willing to take the risk in showing them, no matter the results.; , Along with deciding if you are ready, you also want to figure out if the person you love is in a place where they want to kiss you too. Observe how he is acting around you to figure out if he shares the same feelings that you do.Is your love being especially flirty with you? Is he making romantic gestures to show you he really cares about you? Does he seem committed to the relationship? Is he spending more time with you than usual? Does he help you without being asked? These could all be signs that he's in love with you or at least feels strongly about you. This step mainly helps prevent heartbreak in a relationship. Kissing someone you love who doesn't feel the same way about you can be embarrassing and also hurtful, so before you make a move you should feel confident that he would want to reciprocate.  , This doesn't mean physically, but before you kiss someone you love, you should know him emotionally, because this will amp up the kiss and make it more meaningful. Kissing someone you love is different than kissing someone during a hook-up -- you want it to be special and communicate strong feelings towards that person.   If you are not at a point yet where you know someone intimately, take time to get to know them. Maybe you fell in love with him because you saw how he interacted with others, but you haven't had the chance to know him personally. Taking this time to learn who he really is will help create a special kiss.  , One key to making a kiss special and magical is to kiss the person you love in an environment that you view as romantic. This doesn't have to be a stereotypical romantic scene, like on a horse-drawn carriage ride, but it can be something that feels sweet and magical to you. Think about some special spots that you have been to in your relationship or some spots that you think of as romantic. Plan to kiss your partner in one of these locations.Some romantic locations are at a park with a lake or pond, in a secluded corner of a restaurant, at the beach, under the stars, on the top of a building with a great view, etc. Often times the best kisses are somewhere secluded and quiet, so the two of you aren't distracted. However, you can kiss your partner in a place a with a lot going on if you still feel that it would be meaningful.  , You can kiss a person anywhere, but to make it meaningful, it's helpful to plan a meaningful date to set the scene for the kiss. As previously mentioned, choose a romantic location and plan a date that you and your partner would both really enjoy. Maybe you don't find roses and candlelight romantic, but you both love sporting events. Whatever you think would be the most enjoyable date, plan your night around that.During your time together, there will need to be a time where it is appropriate to move closer to your love. If you are doing something where there's always a foot between the two of you, it may not be the best place to kiss. Plan a date where you can become close and intimate with your love.  , The most romantic times in a relationship can also be the most thoughtful, when you've planned a date or given someone a gift because it means a lot to them. Don't just go with a classic ""date night"" but do something fun and different. Take your love to the first place that you met, or the place you first realized you loved him or her.   For example, a couple may be really into books and so a romantic place to kiss would be in the secluded section of an old library. Or maybe they are really into the outdoors, so kissing in a canoe might be really sweet. If you think your partner would enjoy a classic date night, then do that! There is no perfect formula for a good date, so just do whatever you think your date would most enjoy.  , One way to make your love eager and excited for the upcoming date is to leave little hints or reminders throughout the week. Text your love throughout the week saying that you are excited for your date, or send him or her sweet messages throughout the week with compliments or expressing your feelings towards your partner.  , Maybe you aren't much of a planner so a planned date and picked out location seems a bit mechanical to you. In that case, kiss that special someone at a moment that feels right to you. It doesn't always have to be a planned out, perfect date, so when you are with your love and you look at him or her, realizing you are in love, then make the move at that moment!  , Before you make the move to kiss your love, you'll want to look your best so that the kiss can be really special and meaningful. If you normally hang out with your partner in t-shirts and sweats, try a new style like throwing on a nice pair of pants or a skirt and fixing up your hair. This will likely make your love more attracted to you, which will make the kiss even more romantic and passionate.   Consider spritzing on a nice cologne or perfume so that your love will want to snuggle up even closer to you.  , Before you kiss someone you'll want to make sure your breath doesn't smell and that your lips aren't chapped. If you just ate a meal, chew some minty gum to freshen your breath, or if you have time, brush your teeth. You might also want to put on some chapstick if your lips are more chapped than usual., Now that you look the part you're ready to actually make the first move. On your date, or wherever you are, become more intimate with your love by inching closer to her. Consider sitting next to her and putting your arm around her or holding her hand.  , This is key to showing your partner that you love them and to making your kiss special. Eye contact can do so much, as people who know each other well can often communicate a lot of emotions just by staring into each other's eyes. Looking people in the eye is also a way to show someone you aren't just playing around and that they can trust you.  , Show your love how much you care about her or what she means to you by expressing your feelings in sweet words to her. Tell her how you feel about her or compliment her on qualities you really admire in her. This will stir up both of your affections, making the kiss sweeter and more intimate.  , First, look your love in the eyes. Then, you can tenderly stroke her face or move her hair behind her ears. Now, go in for the kiss. Slowly move your face towards hers, coming so close that your lips almost touch but not quite -- this will build suspense. Then, tenderly kiss her lips.  , After you have made the first move and kissed your love, wait a few seconds to see how she responds. She may be really into it and start kissing you back, or maybe she is apprehensive. Either way, after you've made the first kiss let her make the next move.If this isn't the first time you have kissed your love, try increasing intimacy levels. Instead of going straight in for the kiss, begin by kissing her cheeks and her brow. These are tender kisses that will likely get her blood flowing. You may want to avoid using tongue on the first kiss to make sure your love is into it. Once you know your love wants to kiss you back, then you can proceed to french kissing.

Immature ticks (nymphs) are the size of poppy seeds while mature adult ticks are the size of sesame seeds.Ticks are small, almost impossible to see until they get on your skin. To avoid contact with them, avoid areas where they live. Ticks are found in the same kind of environments no matter what part of the world they are in. They love shady, damp wooded areas with a lot of brush and leafy plants. Rotting leaves, tall grasses, piles of wood, and rock walls provide safe, covered environments where ticks like to live.   Ticks will wait in these areas until they can make direct contact with an animal or person. Ticks are not only found in the woods. There are plenty of places in your backyard, especially if there is any tall grass, brush, bushes, or other shaded places for them to hide.; , It is very important to know peak tick seasons, the times of year when infected ticks proliferate. Infected ticks are most prevalent in the spring and summer (May through September in the northern hemisphere). Knowing this should help you to be prepared.For example, if you plan camping trips or garden parties during peak tick season, you can take extra precautions to prevent tick bites.  , When you and your children leave the house and you know that you might be in areas where ticks live, you and your children should wear long pants when walking in grassy and wooded areas. If possible, the bottom of the pants should be tucked inside the socks. Most ticks are picked up on the lower leg area.You and your children should also wear long-sleeved shirts, gloves and hats.This helps to ensure that all body surfaces are covered and that ticks cannot gain access to the skin. AGAIN, tucking pants into socks prevents ticks from being able to crawl up your children's legs. Wear light-colored clothing. It is easier to see ticks on light-colored clothing.  , Children should wear insect repellent on the skin when they are in an area that is, or could be, infested with ticks. The repellent should have a minimum of 20% DEET, which is the active chemical ingredient that repels ticks and other insects.Apply insect repellent on your children's skin, taking care to avoid eyes, mouth, and hands. Reapply every 2-5 hours, depending on the product.You don't want to repellent to be ingested BECAUSE it has a toxic chemical. Make sure you follow the directions on the container of repellent carefully. Products containing permethrin can be applied to clothing. It is also possible to buy clothes that have been pretreated with permethrin. Permethrin is a chemical repellent that is available in local drugstores. It kills ticks and insects that come into contact with it. This chemical is only registered to be used on clothing and not on skin. Follow directions for use on the packaging carefully. If unsure, contact your doctor for proper usage.If you prefer a natural repellent, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) is a natural tick repellent derived from eucalyptus trees. OLE has a distinctive odor and repel ticks as effectively as a low-concentration (10%) DEET product. This natural repellent can also repels mosquitoes and other insects. You can usually find OLE at your local drugstore.Other essential oils, such as citronella, cedar, soybean, or eucalyptus, are not shown to be very effective against ticks., To avoid Lyme disease, avoid tick bites all together. Encourage your children to stay on the trails and avoid walking in areas that are bushy or have long grass, BECAUSE, AGAIN, these are areas where ticks are most prominent., Clear your yard to keep it tick-free. Clean your backyard at least once a year to keep it free of ticks. This includes clearing leaves and bushes because, AGAIN, ticks love these environments. Keep grass trimmed and short, clear away loose, dead, and decaying leaves, and keep all wood piles elevated off the ground so ticks cannot hide in them.For an extra layer of protection if you live near the woods, build a three-foot-wide mulch, gravel, or wood chip barrier between your lawn and surrounding forest to help prevent tick invasion. You can buy special chemicals that are used for tick control in the yard to keep ticks away.Bifen IT, Onslaught, and Permethrin Pro are professional grade chemicals that kill ticks and other insects in your yard.Be sure to use these only in the way specified on the container, especially since they are harsh chemicals that can be harmful to you, your family, and your pets if the directions are not followed. Pesticides called “acaricides” can keep ticks out of your yard. You will need to hire a licensed applicator, who will usually apply pesticide to the area twice a year. This is not something you should attempt to do on your own., Deer are the main source of food for adult deer ticks. If you keep deer away, the chances of getting Lyme disease are reduced because the deer ticks will not hang around your yard. Do this by removing plants (clovers and peas) that attract deer.You can build a physical barrier against deer, such as a fence.  , When your children return home from an activity where they may have come into contact with ticks, you need to perform an inspection as soon as possible. A tick inspection is an examination of the entire body to search for any ticks that may be on your children's skin. Make sure to check extra carefully in the areas most frequented by ticks -- under the arms, in the ears, inside the belly button, behind the knees, between the legs, in and around all hair, and all around the waist.You can use a handheld mirror to inspect areas that would otherwise be difficult to check., When your children get home and after a tick inspection is done, you should instruct them to shower immediately. Ticks usually remain on the skin for some time before they attach themselves more firmly. This makes it possible to wash them away before they become attached and bite, which can prevent the transmission of Lyme disease.Ticks may also attach themselves to pets, so if you walk your dog through any long grass or bushes, you should give them a wash with warm water as soon as possible after getting home. In general, deer ticks will not survive longer than 24 hours without feeding, although ticks on damp clothing can survive up to 2-3 days., After arriving home from a walk or camping trip, wash your family's clothes to remove any ticks that may have attached to them. Make sure to wash the clothes with plenty of hot water and laundry detergent.This will ensure that the tick detaches from the clothes and dies during the wash., Even if you have followed the necessary precautions, ticks are small and might be missed in the first inspection. The ticks can become attached to the skin if they are left on the skin long enough and if they do not wash off in the shower. Because they are easy to miss, it's a good idea to conduct another thorough visual exam to check your children for ticks., The possibility of Lyme disease from a tick bite increases the longer the tick remains attached to your child. Any ticks that have attached to your child's skin should be removed immediately. If you remove the tick within 24 hours of its original attachment, the chance of getting Lyme disease is decreased., Use rubbing alcohol to disinfect your child’s skin around the area where the tick is attached.You should also sterilize the tweezers by wiping them with rubbing alcohol.  , Using a clean pair of tweezers, gently grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible. This will help ensure that you remove the tick’s head and mouth as well. Pull the tick upward and away from the skin steadily and carefully. Do not twist or yank it. Pulling it quickly could rip the body away and leave the mouth parts of the tick behind.Avoid crushing or squeezing the tick. This helps to prevent the possibly toxic fluid in the belly of the tick from entering your child's bloodstream. Avoid using a lit match or petroleum jelly to remove a tick or to try to kill it.These methods will only cause the tick to burrow deeper into the skin and release its saliva, which increases the chance of Lyme disease. They are not effective tick-removal methods. If you find that some of the tick still remains in the skin after removal, don't worry. It's not possible for the tick to survive with just part of its body embedded. The rest of the tick will eventually come out in much the same way as a splinter., Do not dispose of the tick. Instead, once the tick has been removed, kept in a sealed container. You need to give it to your doctor so she can test it to see if it is a Lyme disease carrier.Although helpful, this is not necessary, so don't worry if you can't keep the tick. This is not as high a priority as taking care of your children when they are bitten. If you have to destroy the tick to get it off of your child, do it. Removing it is the top priority.  , In order to remove any residual toxin released by the tick, you need to clean your child's skin. It is best if you use antiseptic or any other antibacterial cleaning agent. Wet a cloth or cotton ball with antiseptic and gently wipe the affected area.If the area becomes irritated where the tick bit your child, swab the area with antibacterial ointment such as Neosporin to ensure it doesn't get infected. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after you have cleansed your child’s skin.  , If your child gets bitten by a tick, you should take him to the doctor. If he is infected, confirming the presence of Lyme disease will allow him to receive the necessary treatment as quickly as possible.   Even if you couldn't keep the tick, your doctor will still be able to diagnose your child either way.  , There is a certain time frame during which Lyme disease symptoms will appear. When your child is bitten by an infected deer tick, signs of Lyme disease can appear anytime within a time range of three days to a month. The first signs of Lyme disease will usually manifest between 3-30 days after the bite at the site of the wound.After your child gets bitten, watch his skin around the initial tick bite closely for 3-30 days for any warning signs., The first symptom to appear will likely be the characteristic skin rash known as Erythema migrans (EM). EM appears like a reddish spot with a circular or oval shape at the site of the bite. This rash tends to expand over time, causing the spot to resemble a bull’s eye because it forms a reddish pink circle that surrounds a patch of clear skin area with another reddish center.This characteristic rash shows up at the bite site in the early stages of the disease, usually after about a week.However, with the gradual spread of the infection within the blood stream, it can show up at various locations over the body., In addition to the rash, the skin around the tick bite may start to have feelings of pain or itchiness. The EM rash shows up in about 70-80% of all Lyme disease cases. The rash may feel warm, but pain, burning or itchy sensations are also symptoms, although they are rarer.In more serious cases, the rash doesn't appear at all. This is dangerous because the infection continues to spread within the bloodstream without any visible signs. This serious type affects other vital organs without the victim being aware that anything is wrong. Lyme disease can also affect the joints, the heart, or the nervous system.If you notice the EM rash, take your child to the doctor immediately., In addition to the EM at the early stages of Lyme disease, patients can develop some flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, general fatigue, enlargement of the lymph nodes, and chills.If you notice the EM accompanied by flu-like symptoms, take your child to the doctor immediately for treatment.  , If your child has been bitten by a tick, you need to watch his behavior carefully. He may not be able to describe what he is actually feeling, so watch him for the warning signs.Common behavioral signs include:lack of concentration difficulties sleeping at night, inability to focus on studies dizzy or confused feelings joint pain recurrent fevers increased sensitivity to light or noise  , There are some symptoms of Lyme disease that do not appear until the late stage of the disease. When Lyme disease is in its later stages, the bacteria is spread to other body locations, which can result in serious problems with many vital organs. These later stages can cause severe problems with the heart, joints, and nervous system.   Affected joints can develop arthritis, which manifests itself by inflammation accompanied by a degree of stiffness, pain, swelling, and narrowing of range of motion. If the heart is affected, your child can develop myocarditis, which is the inflammation of the heart muscles. If the nervous system is affected, the child can develop neuropathic pain, which manifests as fatigue, muscle weakness, tingling and burning sensations in the peripheral nerves.When left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to life threatening conditions such as heart failure or meningitis., The treatment of Lyme disease requires killing the causative bacteria responsible for the infection. The treatment also has to control all the symptoms that appeared and try to prevent any complications or spread of the infection in order to protect the vital organs.Treatment starts first with administering the proper antibiotics. These are only obtainable by a physician and the proper course of the medication will be laid out by the doctor.   She will likely prescribe your child additional medications to control any symptoms.  , If you recognize the symptoms of Lyme disease, you must take your child to the doctor immediately. Your pediatrician will prescribe antibiotics to fight and kill the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.The doctor will determine the best antibiotic type depending on the patient’s age and the state of the Lyme disease.   Generally for children, oral antibiotics will be enough to stop the infection and suppress the characteristic rash. Doctors usually prescribe antibiotics for a week or two as an initial treatment period, which has been found to be enough for the majority of cases to cure the rashes. It is common for doctors to suggest your child continue using antibiotics for another two weeks to achieve complete destruction of Lyme disease. Antibiotics chosen are usually broad spectrum like Augmentin, which is Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid, that is available in many dosage forms to be suitable for different ages. You can also get oral suspensions that are suitable for younger children starting from the age four., If you child is showing signs of late stage Lyme disease, antibiotics through injection is preferred to give a faster response. This direct injection results in faster absorption, which helps the medicine start working and cure it faster. It also helps to prevent or to cure other serious complications such as arthritis.Available injections include brands such as Rocephin (Ceftriaxone) that can be given to children with the concentration of 0.5 mg. These can be injected directly into your child's muscle or vein as a single daily dose.The doctor will observe your child for a period to see if the antibiotics are curing the disease or if he has not responded to the medication. If this happens, the antibiotic type can be changed by the doctor.  , Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually prescribed by doctors for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. These medications also help suppress pain or fever as well as reduce any inflammation and rash that has developed. The medicine relieves the swelling and the warmth sensation at the affected skin spots.   These are commonly prescribed by your doctor when arthritis pain is one of the complications of the child’s Lyme disease.Read the instruction on all over-the-counter medications and note any special instructions for child doses. If you are unsure, ask your doctor. You can buy NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Children’s Advil, Children’s Motrin), Catafast sachets, or Cataflam suppositories (Diclophenac Potassium), which are available as syrups, suppositories, or sachets. Your doctor will give the right prescribed medication according to the child’s age. Do not give children under 18 aspirin, as it has been linked to the development of Reye’s syndrome, a rare but dangerous condition in which the liver and the brain swell., Although they will not cure Lyme disease, topical anti-itch applications such as creams or gels can be applied directly at the rash spots to prevent your child from scratching them. These ointments relieve the itching or burning sensation in the affected areas. The soothing effect can calm the whole skin area, helping to suppress the painful itchy sensation.Consult your doctor before applying any creams to your child’s skin. You will still need to use antibiotics to cure the Lyme disease. Anti-itch ointments only relieve symptoms.

If your paper is about a science topic, you'll want to interview a scientist in that field. If your paper is about a period of history, you'll want to interview either a historian or someone who's lived through that period of history. If you plan to make your essay an opinion piece, you'll likely want to interview someone who has a strong opinion about the topic covered in your essay. Ideally, you want someone who can express opinions articulately, and who also has credentials in the area you plan to write about. If your piece will have a narrow perspective, you'll need to interview only one or two people. If your piece will present a general consensus, you'll need to interview more people, probably with varying expertise and credentials.; , In order to conduct an effective interview that can in turn become a successful interview essay, you need to delve into the history and background of your subject(s) and the topic at the core of your essay. You can use this information to determine the best questions to ask in the interview.When available, read works about and works written by your subject, both in print and online. At the same time, research the topic associated with your subject. The more you know about both, the more intelligent questions you can ask. Look for previous interviews your subject has given, as well. These will give you an idea of what questions the person has been asked before, so you can decide on appropriate subjects for your own questions, including questions that no one else has asked. Questions that require ""yes"" or ""no"" answers are good for gathering specific factual information; open-ended ""how,"" ""why,"" and ""tell me about"" questions are great for gathering additional background material not found in your research. Draw up a list of the questions you are prepared to ask. Have more questions ready than you will likely use, so that you can make adjustments as the interview takes place. (For instance, your subject may begin focusing on what you thought was a side topic, but turns out to be the key part of your interview.) Rank your questions in order of importance to make sure you ask your best ones, or list them all in the order you'd ask them and color-code the most important ones.  , You'll need to contact the interviewee (or his or her representative) to arrange a time and place to conduct the interview. You'll also need permission to record the interview with either audio or video equipment, or to take photographs. Be sure the person you contact knows who you are and why you want to interview him or her.Choose a quiet place with few distractions for your interview site. A library, restaurant, or campus location if you're doing this for a college writing class would be suitable. You may want to get the interviewee's consent to use his or her comments in your essay in writing, as well as permission to record those comments during the interview. By law, if you are recording an interview conducted over the phone, you must obtain written permission.It's helpful to have a backup interviewee in case the person you plan to interview can't make it. Be on time at the place you've agreed to meet for the interview.  , Even if you are using a recording device, take notes during the interview, as they can help you look for specific points in the recording to incorporate into the essay.Using a recording device (with permission) is almost always advisable, as it permits you to save your note-taking for jotting down your insights on contexts, themes, how your subject approaches the questions, his/her comfort level, and so on. Be patient and respectful as you ask your questions and wait for responses. Give the interviewee time to reflect, and you will likely be rewarded with more insightful answers. A few deeper responses are usually better than many superficial ones. Immediately after the interview, write down your thoughts and impressions about the interview and interviewee. They may help you shape the essay. Always end the interview by thanking the person.  , If the essay is a class assignment, the format will likely be pre-determined. Clarify with your instructor whether he or she expects questions and answers, long quotations, or paraphrasing, and if the primary focus should be the interview itself or in placing it in a larger context.Generally, interview essays can be in one of several formats:   Narrative format. This form allows paraphrasing of some information the interviewee says, along with direct quotes for the material you most want to emphasize. This is the most likely format for a class assignment, and offers the most opportunity to add context and analysis. Conversational format. This is a looser format than the formal writing style required for most essays. You can address the reader directly and use both first and second person. This format can be suitable for anything from class assignments to magazine articles. Question-and-answer format. This form presents your questions to the interviewee, followed by the interviewee's responses. (That is, the text looks something like this: (Your Name): How long have you been in the circus? (Interviewee's Name): About 35 years.) These are always direct quotes, although you may insert explanatory material in parentheses and substitutions, such as a person's name in place of a personal pronoun, in brackets. This format is best suited for essays with only a single interviewee or a closely related group, such as spouses or the core cast of a TV show.  , The outline will depend largely on the essay format you are following, but a strong introduction, which clearly identifies your subject and the goals and focus of your interview, is always important.Read over your interview notes and listen to any audio / video recordings you have. Utilizing both whenever available will allow you to thoroughly consider both the highlights of the interview and the most significant themes to emerge from it. These, in turn, will inform your outline of what information your essay will cover and how it will appear.One possible outline could be an introduction that starts with an anecdote about the interviewee and then presents your thesis statement, several key points that support the main focus, and a conclusion that summarizes the information presented. Traditional school essays often utilize a five paragraph format (introduction, three supporting paragraphs, conclusion), and this can often work with interview essays as well.  , If the purpose of your essay is only to present your interviewee to your reader, your thesis will likely be a brief summary identifying the person and his or her background, accomplishments, and qualifications. For instance: ""John Doe eagerly volunteered to serve his country in Vietnam in 1967, and is fortunate to still be here to share his story.""   If, however, the purpose of your essay is to use your interviewee's comments to support a position or examine a larger theme, your thesis will probably be a statement of that position or theme, with the interview / interviewee placed within that context. For instance: ""John Doe's mixed feelings of pride and betrayal reflect those shared by many Vietnam veterans still with us."" Regardless of essay format, make your thesis clear and concise, and be sure that the remainder of your essay refers back to it. See How to Write a Thesis Statement for more advice.  , The body of your essay needs to follow the selected format while supporting the thesis and providing substantial coverage of the actual interview.   Interviews can sometimes produce a good deal of repetitive answers (even with high-quality questions), so you may need to trim repetitions and unnecessary elements from the body of your essay. Make sure that whatever material you do keep remains true to both the spirit of the interview and the overarching focus of your essay.A handout from the Writing Center at the University of North Carolina (available at http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/oral-history/) provides a wealth of valuable materials on interview essays. It includes, for instance, examples of how to utilize the same interview materials in a transcription (question-and-answer format), a presentation of individual experiences (quotations and paraphrases), and the placing of the interview / interviewee in a larger context (paraphrasing and quotations with ample explanation).  , Any type of essay, including interview essays, should be thoroughly proofread and carefully revised to provide maximum clarity and impact.   Reading over the essay yourself is a good start, but it is always wise to have another set of eyes look it over as well. Another reader is likely to catch errors, repetitions, and unclear sections that you have glossed over.Go back to your original interview notes, recordings, and transcripts, and make sure that your essay continues to reflect the actual interview. Layers of editing and revising can sometimes cause the essay to drift away from the original source and intent. You may even want to let the interviewee read it over to ensure that it captures his or her voice., Depending on your assignment, you may not need to explicitly cite the interview itself, but always check to make sure. Always cite any supplemental materials, however.Any materials you used for research, information about the interviewee, or context for the essay itself should be referenced in the approved citation format for your essay. Make sure one more time that any direct quotations from your source are placed in quotation marks, and any paraphrasing is done without quotation marks. Don't put words in your subject's mouth, and respect the words that do emerge from it.

If you live in a tiny apartment and already have two dogs, adding a third might be stressful and overwhelming. If you work a 60 hour week and barely have any spare time, you might not be the best dog sitting candidate for your friend.Consider the dog’s activity level. Is it a dog that is very energetic that needs lots of time outside to run around each day? Or, is it a dog that is more mellow and relaxed? Make sure your lifestyle matches the dog you’re being asked to watch so that you’ll both be happy and comfortable. Make sure you’re comfortable with the amount of time you’ll be caring for the dog. While a day or two might not be too overwhelming, a few week might be too much for you to handle. Discuss this with the dog’s owner beforehand.; , If you’ve never actually met or become acquainted with the dog you’ll be caring for, it’s important to meet the dog before it’s time for the dog to be in your care. You want to make sure you’re comfortable with the dog, and that the dog is also comfortable around you. Try meeting up with your friend and the dog on neutral ground, like at a park. Spend a little while getting to know the dog.   If you’ve already met the dog you’ll be caring for, still try to spend a little bit of time with the dog before it’s in your care to renew your bond.  , Before the dog is left in your care, talk to its owner about what medications it’s on. Whether it’s medicine they have to take daily, or something they’ll need to take just once while they’re with you, make sure you have all the instructions for each medication before the owner leaves. It’s a good idea to have the owner write down these instructions, or for you to take notes yourself as they explain.Leave the instructions with the bottles of medication in a place where you can see it, but that is out of reach of the dog and/or any children in the house. Having the number for the dog’s veterinarian is important, even if they aren’t on any medications. You’ll want someone to reach out to if anything goes wrong. Their vet will have all the dog’s records, so they can provide the best care in an emergency. They can also advise you on any medications if you lose the instructions, or aren’t sure about anything.  , Many dogs are on very specific diets. Make sure you know how much to feed the dog as well as when to feed them. Ask the owner if the dog likes to “graze,” or eat a little bit now and then throughout the day. This would mean leaving his food down all day, so if you have a pet of your own that might eat the food, make sure you work this out. Ask about any foods the dog isn’t allowed to have, and how many treats they’re allowed on a daily basis.Keep in mind that some dogs might be a little stressed out when their owner goes away, so their eating habits might change a bit until they adjust.  , Before you are left alone with the dog, make sure you’re aware of any possible aggression issues, housebreaking problems, or even shyness the dog might be dealing with. Some dogs might have leash aggression, or they might be very timid around new people. Some dogs might occasionally still have accidents in the house. Make sure you’re prepared for these potential problems, and talk with the dog’s owner about ways to deal with them successfully.If the dog has serious aggression issues, you might suggest that the owner board them with a professional boarding facility that is better equipped to handle that sort of behavior.  , If the dog will be staying at your home and you have pets in the house, make time to introduce the dog to your pets prior to the dog’s stay with you. Introduce your friend’s dog to your dog somewhere neutral first, like a park. Then, you can bring the dog to your home after they’ve been acquainted. Make sure they get along with any other pets in the house, like cats. If there are any issues, you’ll have time to sort them out before the owner leaves.Consider keeping the dog separate from your pets when you are not home. Since they are still new to one another, there might be a chance for one to become territorial over toys or aggressive when you aren’t there to intervene.  , Even if the dog sleeps in a crate at night, or stays in one while home alone, you really shouldn’t keep the dog in its crate just as a means of keeping it in one place. It’s a good idea to put up baby gates to confine the dog to a “safe” area of the house, or even to keep the dog separate from your pets while you aren’t around.If you plan to confine the dog to a certain part of your home, make sure that the dog still has access to water.  , Ask the owner how the dog usually sleeps at night in its own home. Does the dog sleep in bed with the owner? Does the dog sleep in a crate? Does the dog have its own bed? However the dog sleeps, set up a similar sleeping situation for it in your home. If the dog has its own bed, for example, bring that bed over to your house so it will have a familiar place to lie down and rest at night. If he sleeps in a crate, bring the crate to your house.Having something from the dog’s own home can be helpful. The item will smell like home, and it might act as a comfort for the dog. So, even if the dog sleeps in a crate, make sure to bring a blanket or pillow from its home to put in the crate with him. If the dog usually sleeps in bed with its owner, but you aren’t comfortable with the dog sleeping in your bed, find some middle ground. For example, you could set up the dog’s own bed right beside yours on the floor.  , If you can, just use the dog’s regular bowls from its home. Make sure you know whether or not to leave food down all day for the dog, and make sure your own pets won’t eat the dog’s food. Make sure the dog always has access to fresh water. Change the water in the water bowl a few times a day to make sure it stays clean and fresh.   To deter your own pets from eating the dog’s food, try feeding them in separate rooms, or keeping them separated when you aren’t around if the dog needs food down all the time. Consider putting down a mat or towel under the bowls. This will keep water from sloshing onto the floor, and help keep the dog’s food bowl in place while he eats.  , To ensure the safety of the dog, make sure to put all fragile and/or toxic or harmful items out of reach. Put up loose cords, remove items from the coffee table, put away the trash can or make sure the lid is securely shut, keep all food put away and out of reach, and keep toilet lids shut. This will help keep the dog out of trouble, as it might be a little more curious than usual being in a new environment.Ask the owner if the dog has any chewing habits. If so, make sure to put shoes away in the closet and shut the door securely.  , Depending on the length of time you’ll be caring for the dog, you might consider simply staying at your friend’s home for your own convenience. Or, if you will just be caring for the dog a short time, simply checking in a few times a day might suffice. Either way, you will want to discuss this with your friend beforehand.   How often you check in might depend on the dog’s needs and activity level. For example, an older, more mellow dog might only need one or two short walks a day, while a younger, more active dog might require more frequent attention and checking on.  , Ask the owner what the normal routine is for the dog. Is the dog allowed on the furniture? Does the dog get one or two walks per day? Is the dog allowed in the backyard without a leash? Should you leave the dog’s food down all day? Whatever the normal rules and routines of the house are, try to stick to them as best you can. That way, the dog will feel more relaxed and won’t develop any bad habits while the owner is away.If the dog is usually left alone during certain hours of the day, it might be a good idea to let him be during that time. Since it’s part of his routine, it will be easier for him to get back to normal when his owner returns. If the dog has a certain walk routine—like walks at certain times of the day—try sticking to that schedule. This will help keep the dog in its usual routine, even while its owner is away.  , If you’ll be going in and out of a friend’s home while they are out of town, make sure the neighbors know you’re allowed to be doing so. You don’t want to end up with police knocking on the door because a neighbor saw a strange person! Before the owner leaves, be sure to have them introduce you to the neighbors and let the neighbors know that you’ll be dogsitting.The neighbors might also be able to pop in and let the dog out if you have an emergency, so ask the owner to leave a key with a neighbor they trust, and get that neighbor’s contact information.  , Once the owner leaves, the dog might be surprised to see someone unfamiliar entering the home. Keep a little bag of treats in your car or bag, and offer the dog one when you enter the door. Make sure you use a type of treat that the dog usually gets—try grabbing a handful of the treats their owner already has. This will help the dog relax and trust you when you first enter.You might not have to do this every time you enter. Just do it the first few times until the dog is used to you coming in, instead of its owner.

The court documents you receive may include a notice indicating that the matter has been set for a hearing before the judge to determine whether the party can intervene in your case. If the matter has already been set for hearing, there will be strict deadlines for when you must file a written response, if you decide to make one. Depending on the intervening party, you may want to consider hiring an attorney if you don't already have one to represent you. This could be especially important if the intervening party is asserting claims against you and they are represented by an attorney. On the other hand, if the other party is attempting to intervene on your side and they are represented by counsel, their attorney may work with you on some elements of the case. However, keep in mind that attorney doesn't represent you or your interests. If you feel your interests are potentially jeopardized by the intervention of this third party, find an attorney to represent your interests directly.; , A third party may intervene on the side of either existing party in the case, or may have separate claims that are only tangentially related to the existing lawsuit.There are two types of intervention, and the type of intervention the third party is asserting will have an effect on whether the judge will allow them to intervene. If the third party is asserting an intervention as of right, this means they have a direct interest in the property or transaction that is the source of the dispute at the heart of the lawsuit. A third party also may seek permissive intervention, which means they have a claim that involves a common legal question, and they believe it would be more efficient for the judge to resolve the cases at the same time. A judge has broad discretion on whether to allow permissive intervention. However, he or she also has significant discretion when the third party is asserting intervention as of right. If the intervention would cause undue delay or add complexity to the lawsuit, it may be refused. If you don't want the third party to intervene, your argument in opposition should relate to the difficulty and complexity their intervention would add to the case. Since the goal of intervention is efficiency, if you oppose intervention you typically will find the best success in arguments that point to how the intervention would not increase overall efficiency or would actually be less efficient than handling the cases separately.  , Whether the third party is intervening on your side or against you, it can be easier to get the judge to make a decision if the existing parties in the case are in agreement on whether the intervening party should be included in the lawsuit.You want to find out what position the existing parties in your lawsuit are taking regarding the intervention. You stand a much greater chance of achieving your goal if you and the other party can present a united front. For example, suppose you have a third party attempting to intervene on a case in which you are the plaintiff. You don't want the intervention. If you can get the defendant to agree with you and oppose the intervention, the judge likely won't allow the intervention. However, if you want to add the intervenor to your case, you may be able to talk the other side into not opposing the intervention – even if they originally had planned to do so. If you want to add the intervenor, when you negotiate with the other side, stress how intervention would be in their interests as well as yours.  , A judge generally won't grant a motion to intervene unless the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the claims the intervening party is asserting. This is fairly straightforward when the intervening party is seeking to join either the plaintiff or the defendant in the existing action, but can get more complex when the intervening party has independent claims of their own.Generally speaking, the court has jurisdiction if the intervening party could have brought a separate lawsuit in the same court. To figure this out, you must analyze the claims asserted by the intervening party as though they were raised in a complaint in a separate case. If you have questions about jurisdictional issues, consult an attorney. In this situation, you also may be able to talk to attorneys in your case that represent other parties – particularly if they hold the same position on the intervention as you do.  , A response to a motion is a written response filed with the court that details your arguments either for or against allowing the third party to intervene in the civil lawsuit. It's typically not strictly required that you respond in writing to the motion.The response typically begins with a paragraph that identifies who you are, your role in the case, and the position you're taking in response to the motion to intervene. For example, if you're supporting the motion to intervene, your introductory paragraph might say ""Plaintiff submits this Response to the Motion to Intervene, filed on June 4, 2016, and served on Plaintiff on June 5, 2016. Plaintiff supports allowing the Movant to intervene in this case."" Your response will have additional sections that go into the background of the case, the position of the intervening parties, and the legal and factual reasons you support their motion. Because a written response includes substantial legal argument, it generally isn't a good idea to attempt to draft this document on your own unless you have extensive legal knowledge. You can hire an attorney to draft the document for you without representing you in the case as a whole, which could save you in attorney's fees. If there's a particularly short deadline to respond, however, you may not have time to find someone. Keep in mind that you don't have to file a written response at all – you just have to be ready to explain to the judge at the hearing why you either support or oppose the intervention.  , If you've drafted a written response to the motion to intervene, it typically must be filed with the clerk of court by an established deadline, typically a week or two after the motion is filed, or at least a couple of weeks before the date the hearing is scheduled.The deadline by which your response must be filed will be included on any notice form you received. If you didn't get a notice, you can check the court's rules or call the clerk of court and ask. While the clerk can't give you any legal advice regarding your case, they can inform you about deadlines for filings and general procedural rules. Take your original response to the clerk along with at least one copy for each party (including the intervening party) in your case and a copy for your own records. The clerk will file-stamp your documents with the date. There typically isn't a fee for filing a response to a motion – but if there is, expect it to be $50 or less. You can call the clerk and find out before you take your documents for filing so you're prepared.  , A copy of your response to the motion to intervene must be served on all existing parties in your lawsuit, as well as the party that filed the motion. Typically service must be completed either before or within a few days after the date you filed the document with the clerk.These sorts of filings typically are served using certified mail with returned receipt requested. The clerk may have the forms available for you to complete this at the clerk's office. Use the addresses for each of the parties – or their attorneys – that are provided on the court documents. The address to use for service typically is included under their names on court documents they've signed and filed. Keep the green card you get back when your documents have been delivered – it serves as your proof of service.  , Although the judge has the right to make a ruling on the documents filed without holding a live hearing, typically a hearing will be scheduled so the judge can hear from the intervening party and the existing parties in the case.The hearing likely was scheduled on the judge's regular ""motion day."" In most courts, the judge has one day a week in which he or she hears motions filed in a variety of cases on the docket. Take a seat in the gallery of the courtroom until your case is called or you are told to move to the tables at the front of the courtroom. If the hearing is on a motion day, the time your hearing is listed may be first thing in the morning. However, this doesn't mean you're first on the judge's list. All parties for all motions the judge plans to hear that day must be in court at the same time. The judge typically will start the day with a docket call and find out how much time each hearing will take. Then he or she will decide which motions to hear first.  , When the judge hears the motion, he or she typically will call on the moving party to first explain why they want to intervene in your case. Then supporting or opposing arguments will be heard.Be ready to explain to the judge why you believe the intervenor should be added to the case. If you oppose intervention, you likewise must be ready to explain why you think the intervention is a bad idea. If you're going it alone, you may want to prepare note cards listing the points of your arguments and their supporting reasons so you can present your case smoothly and articulately. Speak slowly in a loud, clear voice so the judge can hear and understand you. If the judge asks you a question, stop speaking and respond to the judge's question – you can pick up your argument again after the judge indicates he or she is satisfied with your answer.  , While the judge may hear all sides regarding the intervention, ultimately whether to admit a third party into proceedings already underway is entirely within the judge's discretion.The judge may make a decision at that moment, or may decide to take the matter under advisement, review the documents filed, and make a decision later. Once the judge has made a decision, he or she will issue a written order that will be available to all parties in the case. If the judge grants the third party's motion to intervene, he or she typically will sign an order that was already prepared by the intervening party.  , If the judge refuses to allow the intervention, and the third party is intervening to join your side of the lawsuit, other methods may be available that would allow that person to join the case.With joinder, you and the other party are both named as plaintiffs or defendants (whichever side you're on) in the lawsuit. Similar to intervention, joinder can be compulsory or permissive. However, with compulsory joinder – contrasted to intervention as of right – the judge has no discretion on whether to add the new party. Compulsory joinder generally exists where complete relief for your side of the case is not possible without this other party being present. If the third party's claims arise out of the same property, dispute, or transaction that forms the basis for the lawsuit, permissive joinder may be possible.

A consultant sells their experience and skill in the form of advice and analysis to other businesses. Typically the businesses that might need the consultant's experience and skills don't need a person to fill that role on a permanent basis. If you have a skill or an area of expertise but don’t have a lot of money to start something up, sell that expertise.In order to get work as a consultant, you will need to offer unique or special skills needed by others. For example, you could be a manufacturer's representative, represent other service providers, or another consulting type based on your skills and experience. You can get started in consulting for very little money. Print up some business cards and get a website. You can do all of your initial marketing through networking, making appearances at conventions, trade shows, and conferences.; , If your ambition is to sell a product but you don’t have the start-up capital and are having trouble accessing it, think about starting a service-based business and transitioning over to a product-based business.Look for low cost, low skill opportunities.   If you have the inclination to sell a product, it means that you probably have expertise in that area. If you want to sell pies, for example, you probably know how to bake. Therefore, use your expertise to accumulate start-up capital. The baker in this example could take over pastry duties for a catering company while he accumulates the capital to open his own shop.  , If you have any hobbies or skills related to manufacturing or buying and reselling goods, you can easily turn this into a business. You can start online by making or buying goods to sell on sites like eBay, Amazon, and Etsy. Doing so is simple and only requires you to come up with products, store them, and ship to buyers. You can also open a retail store for the same purpose.   Alternately, you can easily offer a service by opening a restaurant or similar business if you are skilled in a certain area. For example, someone skilled at making innovative grilled cheese sandwiches might open a food truck to serve them.  , Transferring from employee to a contract worker status provides a taste of self-employment and running a business. Consider working for your existing employer and offering part-time with services such as house-sitting, computer repair, pet walking, or another tasks that requires little expertise. If your ambition is only to run a business—any business—there are many that you can start for very little capital. Even if you have more specific ambitions to sell a particular product or service, you can at least gain experience running a low cost startup., Your first step should be to identify a potential product or service that you can offer for sale. Defining a successful product or service will require a lot of thought, research, and brainstorming. You can start by brainstorming a problem that you have in your life, or that you've others have, that doesn't have a clear or easy solution. Identifying this type of need is how many successful companies were founded.   For example, Google was founded as an easier way for people to search for information online. You can also start with an innovation on an existing product or service that makes it more affordable, easier to use, or otherwise better in some way. In the end, your product or service should be something you are passionate about offering to customers.  , Now that you’ve learned some things about the marketplace and how much you will need to get going, you need to articulate your competitive advantage over other players in the market.In other words, what it is that the consumer can get from you that they can’t get somewhere else.If you don't have a competitive advantage, the likelihood of success is significantly reduced. Your business's advantage might be low cost, better quality, convenience, broader selections, customization, location, or customer service, for example. This is vitally important, but it’s different for each business.One company's competitive advantage might be quality, another's might be cachet, while another's might be low prices. Sometimes they are very concrete advantages--Tesla is an innovator in electric cars--while others are purely abstract--Coke is The Real Thing. You have to decide what it is you’re going to do better than anyone else, because once you have, you get a better idea of what the true size of your market is. Take Walmart and Target for example. They both offer very similar concepts—the one stop shop—but they execute in different ways. Walmart stands on the perception of having the lowest price. That’s their competitive advantage. Target keeps price in mind, but what they do different from their competitors is to offer an atmosphere that’s modern, sleek, stylish, and clean. The market for stylish is always going to be a little smaller than the market for cheap, but Target’s strategy is to make up for it in higher margins.  , The first step to solve your problem of lack of knowledge is to think about the contours of your market.Make an effort to answer the following questions:   Try starting your research by studying potential competing companies or by looking up industry information that is publicly available. Make observations of businesses in your area, specifically what they sell or provide and the demographics of their customers. Who wants to buy your product or service? This is the most basic question of all. Is the user of the product or service the same person who pays for it? Is it something that they need or is it something that they want? Do they need to have a relationship with you in order for you to make money? What is the total size of the market? The size of the market dictates your ability to get funding and where you can get it from. The total market for health-services is far larger than the market for hydraulic presses. If you’re trying to get a new kind of hydraulic press to market, your approach needs to be narrower. Finally, how does the market for your product or service behave? Is demand constant over time, like the market for toilet paper, or does it fluctuate, like the market for candy canes? Do people generally only buy the product or service once or seldom, like appliances, or do they buy them regularly, like dry cleaning?  , There are all kinds of ways to reach a consumer. You need to think about how you can most easily allow the consumer to buy from you. One of the cheapest ways to sell goods to a consumer is through online stores, but that type of platform doesn’t work for all kinds of businesses, especially service-based businesses.You might need to consider a brick-and-mortar store or even taking your product directly to the customer.   Outside of online sales, you can offer products or services through competitive bidding, a retail storefront, or through multiple different channels. Unless you have invented something truly unique, someone is probably already selling something that is at least similar to what you want to sell. Think about how they get their goods to market, then think about how you can do it better. For years, groceries were bought at stores where all of the items were located behind the counter. You asked the grocer for what you wanted, and he got it for you. It was tedious and time consuming, but when packaging was primitive and everything came in large bulk containers, it made sense. When packaging advanced, the supermarket was invented. It disrupted and destroyed the old model for doing business. Moral of the story: sometimes the way you reach the consumer is through innovation.  , Your next step is to figure out how your business will be funded and how it will make money. Determining start-up costs is not an easy thing to do, but it’s necessary that you do it well, because it’s how you’re going to get the right amount of funding. Ask yourself what you would need to have to go into business tomorrow—materials, personnel, facilities—anything you might need. Tally it up. Now ask whether that’s enough to make you self-sustaining.For example, to start an auto lot, you’ll need a lot, an office to work out of, office supplies, inventory, car washing supplies, signage, etc. To be self-sustaining, you’re going to have to pay for all of those things, in addition to your own residence and personal expenses. You’ll have to sell some cars to do that. So you also need to determine how many cars you’re going to have to sell at what prices to keep the business going from month to month. After finding startup costs, you'll need to forecast revenues, sales, and profits. You'll need to make pro forma financial statements (statements based on sales forecasts) month by month first two years, and then quarterly for the next five years. Financial projections are a way of quantifying the results of a business idea. For more on sales forecasting, see how to forecast sales before starting a business.  , There are all kinds of sources on writing a business plan, including this excellent resource: Write a Business Plan. But the general outline consists of a general company description, a description of the products and services you sell, a marketing plan, an operational plan, the management and organization of the company, and a financial plan. Be sure to develop hard numbers on startup cost, market saturation, customer base, staffing needs, and logistical concerns.   This document should be detailed but readable, and you should anticipate creating a plan that is 20-40 pages long.At minimum, your plan should include elements of production or acquisition of products and services to sell, your marketing and sales plans, and financial information. Your business plan is a map explaining how you will accomplish the objective of creating a viable business with your product or service.  , You know what you want to sell, how you want to sell it, who you want to sell it to, how much it will cost to get going, and what you’re going to do better than anyone else. Now what you have to do is to turn it into a sales pitch.That’s right, before you can sell your actual products and services, you have to sell investors and consumers on you and your idea. Concentrate on boiling down your idea into something that you can get across in 45-90 seconds. People call this the “elevator pitch,” but it’s not so much about elevators as it is about learning to grab people’s attention in a world that is constantly competing for it. There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all sales pitch. Maximize your strengths that appeal to the person you're pitching, while obscuring the weaknesses that would repel them. You'll need to know those strengths well enough to talk about them compellingly for five seconds or five hours, depending on what the situation calls for. In addition, you need to develop the emotional intelligence to know what will be convincing to any particular person.  , If you don’t need much to start your business, you can always consider liquidating your assets at the flea market or on Ebay. There are a host of businesses that can be started for less than $100, such as scrap metal dealing, errand services, tax prep, cleaning services, and making soap. So if your financial goal is modest, you can get a long way toward reaching it just by selling your stuff., A common source of startup funding for small business is contributions from friends and family. These sources offer flexible repayment terms and can give you lower interest rates than any other source. However, you'll need to get in writing whether the money is an investment (for equity), a loan to be repaid, or a gift so that you can avoid confusion when it comes time to repay the money.   Ideally, you should structure the loan/gift/investment with a legal contract drawn up and inspected by a lawyer that lays out terms and a repayment schedule., If you’ve got a great idea for a business but are struggling to find funding, you might want to consider a crowdfunding platform, because it minimizes each donor’s commitment while also allowing them to get in on the “next big thing.” There are three types of crowdfunding that are especially relevant for a prospective entrepreneur.Rewards crowdfunding is probably what a lot of people think of when they think of crowdfunding. In a rewards crowdfunding scenario, the donors get rewards for donating. A media project might give donors a complimentary CD or DVD, t-shirt, or other promotional items, for example. Different donation levels get correspondingly different rewards. Equity crowdfunding is when the donor gets equity in the company. While a lot of entrepreneurs might not want to cede that level of control over to a donor, it can be a great way to get funding without taking out a great deal of debt. Lending crowdfunding is debt-based crowdfunding. Interest rates and length of the loan are usually predetermined, and the life of these campaigns is usually shorter than other campaigns.  , In order for a business to raise money by selling equity (shares of stock) or debt securities (bonds), they usually have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Registration is usually prohibitively expensive for small businesses. However, Regulation D allows these small businesses to sell securities under certain conditions.   As an exception to regular SEC policy, Regulation D filings are somewhat complicated. It is advisable that you hire an experienced financial attorney to take you through the filing process.There is a certain risk in offering investment to strangers. These people might have a significant amount of control over your business decisions if they own a large amount of equity. You'll have to make sure your goals for the business are aligned before signing them on.  , Venture capital (VC) firms invest in small businesses in exchange for equity. Many times, this is done through incubators and accelerators. Incubators can be another great way for a likely entrepreneur to get a start.Incubators are organizations sponsored by governments, nonprofits, or investors that allow startups to pool resources. Accelerators are similar to incubators, except that they offer more hands-on assistance for the participants.A startup associated with an incubator may be taken more seriously than one that isn’t. Incubators can provide access to capital, shared work resources, co-working spaces, advice from other entrepreneurs, and opportunity for the cross pollination of ideas. See if any incubators are active in your area by searching the International Business Innovation Association’s directory. Should you be selected to join an accelerator, you can expect to attend trainings, seminars with seasoned entrepreneurs, guidance from a mentor, and perhaps even seed-funding. Accelerators can be a great opportunity for the start-up. Many accelerators even offer participants the chance to pitch investors at the end of the program.  , It’s the most conventional way to go about funding a business startup, and there’s a reason for that: banks have a lot of money and everyone knows it. You can expect, however, that banks will typically be the most conservative investors, so you’ll need to have the details of your business plan nailed down before you apply.The best option for a small business in many cases is to apply for a Small Business Administration (SBA) loan. These are loans backed by the government that small businesses can more easily qualify for and repay. Remember, though, that loans are not like equity investments and must be repaid. You can find a guide to applying for a small business loan at Get a Small Business Loan, but be aware that banks typically look at the strength of the idea, credit-worthiness of the applicant, market saturation, and the perceived abilities of the entrepreneur to run the business.

Go to bed at a reasonable time to ensure you sleep well. Anywhere from 7 to 9 hours of sleep is a good goal.; , Missing the bus makes you late for class and forces your parents to drive you to school. Wake up on time and have a backup plan that doesn’t involve your parents.   Don’t use the snooze button. Don’t risk sleeping through the subsequent alarms. Any sleep gained through the snooze function is not quality sleep. Set the alarm for the last possible moment. Eradicate the ability to snooze or dawdle by setting your alarm so that you only have just enough time to prepare for school and reach the bus. Get a loud alarm. The alarm needs to be loud enough so that you don’t ignore it while sleeping. Rain or other ambient noises will also mask low alarm volumes. Move the alarm out of reach. Place the alarm across the room to force yourself to stand up and walk to turn it off., Paying careful attention earns understanding. You’ll need little help outside of the classroom if you do everything you can to pay attention.   Sit in the front of class. It is easier to pay attention and harder to slack off if you are at the front of the classroom. Ask the teacher if you can move closer to the front if you have assigned seating arrangements. Sit up straight. Proper posture increases blood flow and oxygen to the brain, keeping you alert.  , Writing down notes helps reinforce information in your memory and helps you follow the lesson. Typing notes also works - ask your teacher if devices such as laptops are allowed.  , There is no shame in asking a question if you need clarification on a topic. Ask the teacher after class if the question is complex, or if you don't want to ask during class., Homework reinforces the information you were taught in class and builds the research and review skills that are important all throughout life. Make homework a priority when you return from class.   Do homework at the same time every day. Regiment your homework so that it becomes a part of your routine – you’ll approach homework with less trepidation.  , Prioritize your school work, including homework and projects, based on due dates and the amount of work required.   Write them in a planner if necessary. Larger work, such as book reports, require a longer, structured approach.  , Use car or bus rides, lunch or other breaks in routine to squeeze in extra work. Even briefly reviewing your notes can help you prepare for homework or tests.  , Look into whether your school offers study group sign ups or after-class tutoring. If you can attend, both help test your knowledge and shore up any lack of understanding you have. Studying with local friends also helps, but make sure you stay on task., Chores aren’t meant to punish you! Your parents do a lot to keep food on the table and a roof over your head. Look at chores as a way of thanking your parents for what they do for you every day. It takes work out of their hands and gives them some rest.   Write down your chore list on a piece of paper or spreadsheet and hang it somewhere as a reminder. This helps keep the chores on your mind throughout the week. Make a game out of chores. Gamifying chores helps provide the motivation needed to get the task in question done. Several cell phone apps now exist that help manage tasks such as chores while providing a fun sense of progression when you complete your goal., Cooking is a time-consuming, multi-step process that can always benefit from an extra hand or two. Help cut vegetables, boil the water or even read the recipe.   Pick a day or two out of the week to take care of the entirety of dinner. Even if your cooking skills aren't polished, your family will appreciate a work-free meal.  , Be mindful of the mess you make around the house and strive to keep tidy. There are numerous small ways of keeping clean that can add up.   Close the toilet seat lid when done. Clean up any mess that may have occurred at this time. Keep your dirty clothes in the hamper or a specified clothes bin. Clothes strewn about the floor are uncleanly and contribute to an overall untidy room. They can also obstruct movement and cause tripping or other hazardous accidents. Clean your dishes when you are done with them. If you have a dishwasher, rinse your dishes and place them in the dishwasher as soon as you are finished. Put items back where they belong. Return books, magazines, television remotes and any item not strictly yours back where you found it when you are done.  , Cats and dogs require a high level of care and attention. Share the responsibility of watching over them by feeding them, walking them or cleaning up after them as necessary.   Combine pet responsibilities with your chore list if it helps you remember to perform them. Remember that while a room can stay dirty for an extra day, an animal’s needs cannot be postponed.  , Opt for a simple but stylish appearance if your parents still help pay for your clothes. Designer brands are particularly expensive and burdensome if you have siblings who need clothes as well.   Purchase accessories for their purpose, not their looks. Items such as bags or purses perform the same, no matter how they look. Grooming items such as deodorant and makeup are also available for cheap, without sacrificing quality. Visit your local drugstore and test for quality before purchasing.  , Bike, walk or bus to your destination to save your parents the trouble of constantly driving you places. Ask your friends who drive if you can catch a ride from time to time. That’s what friends are for!   Many cities have bike lanes for commuting. Check with your state’s Department of Transportation website to map out where bike lanes are available near you. Be careful when planning – some areas or routes only partially support bike lanes. Always wear your helmet. Bus routes are available on your state’s Department of Transportation website. Make sure you bring enough money to cover fare. Pay attention to bus schedules – don’t miss the last bus that runs for the day. Use the metro if available in your city. A combination of metro and bus travel can take you far, provided you have the proper fare. Pay attention to the metro schedule. Like the bus, the metro stops running at certain hours of the day. Download a route planner app. These apps help you plan out which public transportation to take for greatest efficiency and are conveniently located on your cell phone.  , Family plans are available from many carriers and often a great value for your whole family. Charge your phone overnight so that you can always use it when necessary. Store important numbers in your cellphone in the event of an emergency. Some numbers to include:   Your family members. The local police department. The local fire company. Poison control. Your doctor. Nearby hospitals. Teachers. Friends., A part-time job offers extra spending money while keeping you out of trouble. Make sure your job fits your existing schedule and transportation capabilities.   Don’t work more than 15 to 20 hours a week at your job. Leave enough time for your academic responsibilities. Know the work rules of your age group. If you are 14 or 15 years old, you may work only three hours or less on school days and only between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Teens 16 and over may work unlimited hours, but are barred from working jobs deemed hazardous by the Secretary of Labor (such as construction). Let your employer know of your scheduling requirements prior to taking the job to make sure the job is a good fit., Alcohol, weed and other drugs cost money and impact your mental and cognitive faculties, even if for a brief time. Don’t allow bullying or peer pressure to cause you to make decisions that are not your own.   Turn to resources such as D.A.R.E. if you feel pressured by the presence of drugs at your school or neighborhood.Tell your parents or teachers if others are pressuring you to engage in drug-related activities.  , Sports are a great way of blowing off steam and getting exercise, provided they can fit into your scheduling and transportation capabilities. Other clubs, such as band or chess, can help you meet like-minded individuals who can relate to the challenges life throws your way.  , Being a teen is hard! There will be moments when the pressure of school, your friends, your parents and your future become difficult to handle. Remember to step back and de-stress to regain your composure.   Take a walk. Go outside, get some fresh air and give your brain a break from all that stress. Meditate. Deep breathing and mindful thinking help reduce stress while putting you in touch with how you are feeling in the moment. Make a change. Determine if a particular item is causing you stress. Change how you approach that item, or remove it entirely if possible.",1573,"['pets', 'time', 'food', 'free time', 'deadlines', 'pay attention', 'care', 'study group', 'homework', 'class', 'questions', 'concept', 'note', 'school activity', 'advantage', 'transportation', 'chores', 'cell phone', 'dress low maintenance', 'notes', 'drugs', 'part-time job', 'stress', 'school']"
"['recognize that the date is not a total disaster and just relax', 'take a walk', 'ask some oddball questions', 'make conversation more interesting by proposing a debate', 'limit your alcohol intake', 'say that you are not interested in a kind way', 'suggest the two of you become friends', 'reject the possibility of future dates', 'check for signs of chemistry', 'arrive at the date with few expectations and an open mind', 'reflect upon your initial impressions to find out if you have physical chemistry', 'consider if the two of you are compatible based on conversation', 'organize a good first date to allow chemistry to develop', 'give it time']",How to Survive a Date when There's No Chemistry," Just because you do not feel a spark on a first date with someone does not mean it is the end of the world. Keep in mind that it is not possible to have chemistry with everyone. Try to laugh off the lack of chemistry and make the most of the date by considering it an opportunity to make a new friend. Get to know the person like you would try to get to know anyone else. Ask questions about his or her interests, hobbies, likes/dislikes, and goals. Some good questions to ask include:Where did you grow up? What are your hobbies? How do you like to spend your spare time? Where do you work? Do you like working there? What are your friends like? Do you like to read? If so, what is your favorite book? Are you a big movie-goer? If so, what kind of movies do you like? What is your favorite movie?; , If the date is not going well, try suggesting going for a walk. Sitting across from each other in a café can be really awkward if you do not have much in common, but you don’t need to face each other or talk much if you go for a walk. You will also get some mood boosting exercise in the process, which may make you feel better about the date.   Try suggesting a walk by saying something like, “It’s a beautiful day. Do you want to continue our conversation while we walk through town?”  , If the conversation is boring and you are having a hard time paying attention to your date, then try asking a few unexpected questions to spice things up. Even if you have nothing in common with the person, throwing a few curveballs his or her way should make the date a little more fun. Try to ask some things that really interest you.Some questions you might ask include:   “If you could be any cartoon character, who would you be?” “What would you do to survive a zombie apocalypse?” “Where would you go if you could go on an all expenses paid vacation?”  , When it’s clear no relationship will come of this date, you may want to use this opportunity to see just how different you are from your date. Try asking your date about his or her thoughts on global warming or some other controversial issue. Although you might disagree, you might enjoy hearing someone else’s viewpoint and the topic may spark an interesting conversation to help pass the time.   As an added bonus, by learning about your date's opinions you may even become more attracted to him or her. People who have common interests and beliefs tend to be more attracted to each other., Having too much alcohol on a bad date can lead to trouble. First, drinking too much on can impair your judgment, which might make someone who you are not interested in seem more appealing. Second, overindulging in alcohol on a date may make you seem immature and impolite. Drinking too much on a date may also lead to more severe consequences such as contracting an STD. That is why it is wise to stay sober and in control so that you do not do anything you might regret.Try not to drink at all if the date is not going well, just so that you can maintain control and handle the situation in the best way possible. Alcohol is likely to make things worse rather than better.  , If you are not interested, you should let the person know you have no intentions of carrying on a romantic relationship with him or her, but be as nice as possible about it. Avoid making a blunt statement such as ""I am not interested in you.” Phrasing your lack of interest in this way would come across as rude and inconsiderate.Try saying something like, “This is hard for me to say, but I have to be honest with you. I have really enjoyed spending time with you, but I don’t think that we are a good match. You deserve to meet someone who shares your interests and goals and I just do not think that I am that person. But I wish you all the best and I have enjoyed getting to know you.”  , If you do not feel any chemistry but suspect that the two of you may become friends, try making that suggestion. If you do this, be absolutely clear that all you want is friendship. It is possible that this may not be an option if the other person is attracted to you. However if the other person shares your idea, you might have found a great new friend out of a bad date.   Try saying something like, “Even thought we were not a match, I had a good time getting to know you. Do you think we could be friends?” Keep in mind that this strategy can backfire as well, so be careful about using it. Some people may feel just as rejected if you suggest that the two of you become friends. It is also possible that your lack of chemistry may mean that you do not even have enough in common to become friends., If the other person is interested in a second date, you should politely decline either after the first date or later on. You do not need to provide a concrete reason. Avoid being non-committal and do not say things like “maybe we can meet again some time.” Although you may be reluctant to hurt someone's feelings, it is sometimes necessary to do so in order to find what you are looking for.Try saying something like, “It was great to meet you and to get to know you, but I don’t think that we should go on another date. I think you are a great person, but I do not think we are a match. I wish you the best of luck thought and I hope that you find the right guy/girl for you.”  , Chemistry is not scientific. It is not something that can be identified or be developed between two people. However, psychological studies have provided some insights as to what chemistry is made of. It includes non-judgment, similarity, mystery, attraction, mutual trust, and effortless communication.If you have chemistry with someone, then you will probably feel it. But you may want to take a moment to consider what you have in common with the person and determine whether chemistry is really lacking.   Try asking yourself some simple questions to determine if you have chemistry with someone. For example, you might ask, am I attracted to this person? Do we have things in common? Do we share values and beliefs? Do I want to know more about this person? Is it easy to talk to this person? If your answer is yes to any of these questions, then there might be something there. Don’t try to force chemistry. While it is a good idea to search your feelings before you decide that this date is going nowhere, you should not try to force chemistry to develop either. If you do not feel attracted or interested in someone, then that will probably not change.  , Do not let pre-conceived notions about the person, the date spot, or anything else pre-shape your opinion of the other person. This can interfere with how you determine whether there is any chemistry between the two of you. Excitement and anticipation are fine, but judgement and expectations are not. It is critical that you do not make a judgement before the date begins or the instant the date begins.For example, if your date chooses a restaurant that you dislike as your meeting spot, do not read this as an indication that you will have nothing in common.  , Psychologists and relationship experts claim that you can recognize physical chemistry almost immediately. One of the most important factors for physical chemistry is sexual attraction. If you find yourself attracted to a person during the first moments of your meeting, then there is a good chance that physical chemistry can develop. If there was no initial attraction, there is a good chance physical chemistry may never exist between the two of you.Physical chemistry has been shown to be more important for men in determining whether a second date is possible.  , Compatibility takes a little longer to recognize than physical chemistry, and it can only be discovered through conversation and interaction. Compatibility is about common values, similar life goals, being comfortable with one another, shared experiences and having fun together. Compatibility is essential for the development of a healthy and long-lasting relationship. It can even help to build physical chemistry!Studies have shown that women are more likely to look for compatibility than a man would on a first date. You may find compatibility based on your college experiences, your interests in sports or literature, a love of travel, experiences in previous relationships, desire for children, and more.  , Chemistry between you and your date may fail to develop if you organize a terrible date. By spending time together and having a good time, you have a better chance of seeing who the other person is and what they are like. Use your imagination when planning a first date so that it reflects you as a person, but you may want to keep these tips in mind.Pick a fun, neutral location. Avoid noisy bars, as you will want to be able to hear your date. First dates can benefit from having shorter time limits. Consider getting ice cream or a coffee rather than meeting for dinner. Avoid ambiguous locations that give you no aim. For example, meeting at the mall is probably not a good idea unless there’s a particular cafe you can visit. Don't go to the movie theater on a first date. You won’t be able to speak with one another!  , There are a number of reasons why you may not feel chemistry from the moment a date begins. If you are nervous or shy, then this can make it hard to determine if there is any chemistry. Do you best to be friendly and relax, and to offer smiles and encouraging looks. This will help give chemistry a chance to develop.If you are nervous try admitting it. This may help your partner open up. Try saying something like, I am sorry I am not saying much. I am a little nervous.” Ask questions to encourage conversation. You might ask something like, “What do you like to do on the weekend?” Or, “Where are your favorite places to travel?” Avoid asking personal questions on a first date. People have differing levels of privacy and might not feel comfortable sharing everything. For example, it is fine to ask what someone does for a job, but you should not ask how much money someone makes.

If your school offers them, you should take classes that introduce you to the law and business practices; if your school doesn't, consider taking some concurrently at a local community college if you can., You can become an underwriter with pretty much any bachelor's degree, so you don't need to start over if you already have a degree. Nonetheless, most companies would prefer you have a degree in business, accounting, or law or that you at least took some classes in those areas.Math and economic degrees are also helpful., One of the best ways to build up experience is to work as intern. Most big companies will hire interns, including insurance companies. Look for internship positions on the job section of big insurance websites, but you may also be able to find internships through your university. You can work over the summer, or you can try tackling it during the year, as well. Sometimes, you can even earn course credit for internships.Most companies are well aware that you are there to learn as well as provide work. They'll provide you with training sessions you won't get in college, as well as allow you to network with people in the field., While it's not essential to have a 4.0 GPA, a higher GPA may help when you're applying for your first job. You can list it on your resume when you're first on the job market.  , You need to be able to take data and pull the important information out of it to help you solve problems.Your math and statistics classes will help with this skill.   Work on being analytical when going about your day-to-day life. For instance, when looking at an online article, analyze the presented facts to see if they add up to the conclusion the writer is making. In addition, go beyond the article to see if other data supports the writer's conclusion. This process will slowly teach you to pull out what information is important and use that information to make an informed decision., Insurance underwriting is not the place for indecisiveness. You need to be able to look at what you analyzed and make a decision.One way to build decision-making skills is to analyze decisions in your everyday life. If you're trying to buy a camera, take the time to evaluate the information available. Decide what is most important to you in a camera, and see which models measure up., Most of the time, paying attention to detail just means having the patience to be thorough and to go over everything with a fine-tooth comb, sometimes multiple times.   Learn to write it down. You don't need to be able to remember every detail in your head. Use your computer and paper to your advantage. You'll be able to make connections on paper that you may not be able to in your head.You can teach yourself to pay closer attention to detail by trying a detail-oriented hobby, such as logic puzzles, stained glass, or even knitting. These types of hobbies will teach you to focus on the nitty-gritty details, which can help you in your professional life as well., You have to be able to deal with people, as you will need to convey why you will or will not insure somebody, for instance. You'll also need to talk to various professionals, such as medical professionals, to find out more about a person before making a decision.One way to improve your communication skills is to take a speech class. Though you won't be giving speeches (most of the time), speech class may help you build confidence when talking to others. English classes are also important, as they help you build skills in written communication. You can also try getting any job in customer service or retail, as you constantly must deal with people, and it can help build up your skills.  , If you don't want to move, try to find one in your area. If you're interested in what the company stands for before applying, look at the mission statements and recent news on the company.Consider what the company specializes in. If you're more interested in the medical side, make sure to apply at companies that offer medical insurance. If you're more interested in insuring cars, try a car insurance company. Look at benefits. Salary is important, but other benefits are important as well, such as vacation time, a flexible work schedule, and things like gym memberships. Look for interesting perks that show the company values you as an employee. For instance, Nationwide offers ""Life Resource Counselors."" These counselors help with everyday problems, such as finding a plumber or finding a nursing home for your parents.Another thing to look at is voluntary turnover rates. For instance, Aflac only has a 5 percent turnover rate, meaning most people want to stay in their jobs at that company., The position of junior underwriter is usually an entry-level position. Another name for this position is assistant underwriter. However, getting any entry level position can help you get your foot in the door. You can always transfer to the department you want later., If you did work as an intern, apply for a job at the same company. Many companies are more willing to hire someone they know has a good work ethic, and if you've proved yourself as an intern, you'll have an easier time getting in the door.However, even if you don't apply at the same company, you can use your experience to help you gain a position. You actually worked at an insurance company, whereas many of your peers coming out of college may not have that same experience.  , Most certifications require that you have experience in the field before becoming certified.For instance, The Institutes requires 2 years of experience in insurance for some certifications, where you worked for at least 17.5 hours a week. This time must have been completed in the past 5 years.The Institutes is one of the major organizations that provides certification to the insurance industry., Once you're a junior underwriter, it should be obvious which certification is best for you. In fact, your company will likely have a preferred certification for you to obtain and will also likely sponsor you for certification.For instance, The Institutes offers certification in Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter and Associate in Commercial Underwriting., Just like college, you'll need to matriculate with the certification program you choose. Usually, this process just means submitting a form and fee. It means you're joining the program officially. You don't have to do it right away, but you should do it pretty early., All certification requires that you take coursework before taking exams. For instance, the Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter certification requires that you take about eight classes. Four of those classes are ""foundation"" courses, while 3 are from a concentration you'll chose; the last one is an elective option. Each one will take you 4 to 8 weeks, on average.You take these classes online, studying textbooks and course material to pass the exam at the end of class., The exams can vary from certification to certification. For instance, in the Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter certification, you take an exam at the end of each class. However, you also must take an exam on ethics at the end of your certification process, unless you already took a course on it., Different companies specialize in different areas. If you're specialized, you'll be more likely to be needed by that specific company. You can underwrite everything from medical insurance to casino insurance. Once you pick your specialty, read up in that area; in fact, it may not hurt to take a class in that area if you're able to.If you're curious what specialties are in demand, look at current job listings to see what insurance companies are looking for.  , As an underwriter, you will be working with brokers. You will be the one to decide whether a broker's clients receive insurance. Therefore, you need to be on good terms with your brokers. Make sure to establish good relationships early on with your brokers.Remember people's names. Ask how they are doing, and really mean it. Try to remember what each broker likes, and provide that kind of service. The little things will help get you noticed, as well as help establish relationships. It doesn't hurt to keep a written record of details to help you remember. These relationships will show in how much work you get done and how well you do it. Your boss will notice if you are on good terms with your brokers, which can help you move up later.  , It goes without saying that the best way to be noticed is to do your job well. In underwriting, that means paying attention to detail and creating the right plan for the right customer. The right plan will be noticed because your client will be satisfied with what you've done, and you'll get fewer complaints.A good plan will provide the coverage your customer needs, but it won't put your company up for unnecessary risk., Even though sometimes you may be promoted to senior positions without applying for them, let your superiors know want to be considered by applying for positions. If you feel like you are waiting too long to move up, you can also apply for positions outside of the company. If don't actually want to move companies, you can use getting hired for other positions as leverage to move yourself up in your own company.

The exam consists of three sections: Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Each section contains 30 questions. All sections are weighed equally.For each question answered correctly, four points are awarded. For each incorrect answer, one point is deducted. No points are awarded or deducted for unanswered questions.; , The JEE Advanced is structured differently than the main exam. The advanced exam covers the same three topics: Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. However, unlike the main exam, the advanced exam is divided into two three-hour long papers, each divided into three sections (one for each topic). The papers are organized as follows: Paper One: Each section contains 10 multiple choice questions with one correct answer, five multiple choice questions with one or more correct answers, and five questions that require the test taker to provide a single-digit answer. Paper Two: Each section contains eight multiple choice questions with one correct answer, eight questions that require responding to a reading passage, and several ""matching list""-type questions.  , Though both the JEE Main and JEE Advanced cover the same three subjects (physics, chemistry, and mathematics), the precise topics covered and the difficulty of the individual questions will vary between the two tests.To gain a sense for the topics you may be expected to know for each test, consult the official test syllabi for the Main and Advanced exams, both of which are available in free PDF form from official test resources online.Below are just a few examples of the topics you may encounter on the test — these lists are by no means complete or definitive:   Physics: Kinematics, laws of motion, gravity, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, optics, electronic devices. Chemistry: States of matter, atomic structure, redox reactions, chemical kinetics, environmental chemistry, periodic groups, basic organic chemistry principles. Mathematics: Quadratic equations, mathematical induction, sequences and series, matrices, integral calculus, differential equations, coordinate geometry.  , The simplest, most effective way to prepare for the JEE is simply to do the test itself. Mock tests are available for free from the official JEE website. These tests mirror the actual JEE in terms of structure, format, and content and can be accessed entirely through your computer — no physical testing materials are required. Completing mock tests gives you the valuable experience of working through the JEE (and, in the process, finding your strengths and weaknesses) in advance of the actual exam.   Note that while mock tests mimic computer-based versions of the JEE almost perfectly, paper-based versions of the JEE will require you to record your answers by hand on an official answer sheet — for obvious reasons, online mock tests can't replicate this part of the testing experience.  , Another important resource for applicants looking to pass the JEE are the question papers from past tests (freely available on the official JEE website). Unlike the mock tests, which have questions specifically made for them, JEE question papers contain the exact questions included on past exams, making them a very valuable resource.   Because the JEE is relatively new (the exam replaced the old IIT-JEE in 2013), only question papers from 2014 are available. However, since the test is offered multiple times per year, as of late 2014, eight papers have been published, offering plenty of practice material. In addition, question papers for the old IIT-JEE (also available online) will cover most of the same topics.  , This article covers most of what of what a JEE aspirant will need to prepare for the exam, but it's not intended to be a substitute for official JEE test resources. If you're ever unsure about some aspect of the JEE (like, for instance, how to apply, what the eligibility requirements are for public students, and so on), try consulting the JEE FAQ. The FAQ can provide you with the answers to frequently asked questions about the JEE, thus ensuring that you don't have to waste any valuable study time finding the answers elsewhere.  , Over time, the JEE can (and has) changed. Tests may be rescheduled, results may be re-interpreted, and the topics covered may change. To ensure that you have the absolute best chance of doing well on the JEE, stay up to speed with official JEE bulletins, which are published as they are released on the official JEE website.   As an example of the sort of valuable information that may be released in a JEE bulletin, one recent bulletin contained important information on test takers' eligibility for admission to various Indian engineering and architectural programs.  , The official JEE site is generally the most reputable source for test prep materials, but it is far from the only place to find sample questions, practice tests, and other valuable resources. A variety of third-party organizations and agencies also provide JEE test prep materials (some are for free; others cost money). However, since these third parties may not always be reputable or certified, it's important to use discretion and only rely on sources that appear legitimate when studying for the JEE.   One great source for JEE test questions is Khan Academy. This relatively well-known academic site offers free educational material on a huge variety of topics and even has a page dedicated specifically to JEE test prep., In addition to online resources, JEE test prep materials are also available in physical form. Test prep books, brochures, pamphlets, and more are available at academic bookstores. The price (and legitimacy) of these materials can vary — try to choose materials that are officially certified by JEE-administering agencies and contain practice tests, questions from old tests, and so on.   It's also a wise idea to pick books that contain full solutions with explanations (and not just answers) for every question — this way, if you don't understand a question, you'll get the luxury of being walked through the question step-by-step, rather than having to piece the solution together based off the final answer.  , If you've been a diligent student, you may have access to great test-prep resources and not even realize it! Dig up your notes from physics, chemistry, and mathematics classes you've attended and review them, taking time to highlight important topics for further review. If you have access to old problems, consider going through some of these as well for extra practice.   Some students may find it useful to read old textbooks directly — if this is the case for you, feel free to. However, for many, the ""dense"" way material is presented in many textbooks can make it almost impenetrable, so this may not be a great use of your test prep time.  , When it comes to preparing for the JEE, the earlier you start, the better. Studying for the JEE is a serious undertaking, especially if you plan on taking the JEE Advanced. It's also one that can have a significant impact on your professional future — a great score on the JEE can make it much easier to get into the engineering program of your choosing. For these reasons, some people choose to start studying years before they'll need to actually take the JEE. Though this probably isn't necessary if you've been attentive to your studies, for the best score, you will probably want to begin as early as practical — at least a few months before your test date.  , As you study for the JEE, you'll want to devote some time to every topic, even if you're already confident that you know some of them very well. However, to get the best score possible, you'll want to devote the majority of your time to the topics that you're not confident in. Doing this ensures you get the biggest improvement possible from your studying effort.   If you're not sure how to allocate your time, try reviewing your grades from school — spend your most time studying the subjects that you get the poorest marks in.  , In the months before the JEE, you want to make the most of your time — you don't want to waste an hour (or more) fooling around for every hour you spend studying. To avoid distractions like TV, video games, and other forms of digital entertainment, remove them from your life temporarily. For instance, if you're having a hard time giving up your video games, you may want to try leaving your game system at a friend's house until the test is over.   Try to use the internet only for study purposes. Don't waste your study time on games or social networking until the exams are over. If you can't seem to overcome these online distractions, try downloading and installing a productivity app (most browsers will have these available for free in the browser store).  , When you practice individual problems in preparation for the JEE, a good rule of thumb is to take as long as you need to fully understand the problem and answer it correctly. However, when you take entire JEE practice tests, it's a smart idea to give yourself the same 180-minute time limit you would normally have to finish the test. Doing prepares you to account for the time limit when it will actually matter.   You don't necessarily need to be able to complete the entire test within the time limit the first time you try to do so, but you should work to increase your speed so that you're able to finish the whole test in 180 minutes (with as few questions skipped as possible) by the date of the test.  , Past a certain point, additional studying prior to the JEE can actually be harmful. If you have to give up eating or sleeping properly in the days prior to the JEE to squeeze in last-minute studying, you're probably hurting your chances of getting the best grade that you can. Neglecting these basic physical functions can leave you drowsy and distracted on the day of the exam, making it tricky or even impossible to do your best. Take the time to relax, eat normally, and get plenty of sleep in the days before your test — if you've been studying all along, it's almost certainly the smartest thing to do.   This advice isn't unique to the JEE. Neglecting your physical needs (especially sleep) before any test has been demonstrated to lower your score on average.",1718,"['time', 'official mock tests', 'question papers', 'personal distractions', 'test', 'care', 'general questions', 'test day', 'topics', 'main exam', 'test prep books', 'advanced exam', 'use third-party question resources', 'physical needs', 'notes', 'study', 'official jee faq', 'past exams', 'practice tests', 'structure', 'school', 'official bulletins']"

Spool of heavy string for stitching Stretching blocks (small pieces of wood that will hold the leather in place) Needle Razor knife Pronged punches (3 or 4 prongs work) Leather cement (glue) Hammer Clamps (to stretch the leather) Mold of your pistol (you can make this from wood or omit the mold and use your actual pistol) Empty weapon; , You’ll need quite a bit of leather to make your own shoulder holster. Make sure to buy enough, even if it doesn’t match—you can dye it when you’re done.  1’x1’ square 1 ½” strip up to 48” 2”x4” rectangle  , This project will take multiple days to accomplish. However, if you spread it out too long, your leather will be more difficult to work with. Try to keep to a time frame that’s less than a week to make your shoulder holster., 1’x1’ is a good starting size for this piece of leather if you’re working with a standard pistol. For a larger handgun, cut it to make sure you can wrap your weapon in it. You’ll be making the pocket that holds your weapon with this piece; this is the holster. Fold the leather in half over the top of your weapon. When you do so, the handle should stick out. This is how you would grab your weapon if you need it., Using scissors or a utility knife, cut triangles out of the top corners. Your triangles should be an inch tall for a pistol. For a larger gun, you can cut up to 3” off. You should easily be able to fold the leather over your weapon and have a spare inch. This will be plenty of material to work with because it will stretch., Take your leather and soak it thoroughly in water. This will take a few minutes. Eventually, it will become pliable. Once this happens, squeeze the excess water out of it.  The side of the leather than is less tough is the inside of your leather. This side will soak water in better than the rough face of the leather.  , Do this with the middle of the leather piece over the barrel and have it wrap under the trigger. Using stretching blocks, put pressure on the leather around the mold and stretch it out. You should have one block on each side of the leather and it should be as close to the mold as you can. This will help the leather stretch once you clamp the blocks into place.  You can use any clamps that you want, as long as they will hold the blocks in place tightly.  , With the clamps holding the blocks, and the mold wrapped in the leather, place it in the sun to dry. This will take a few hours., Making inserts in your holster will help stiffen it. This helps hold your weapon safely and securely., You’re going to need a right, left, and top insert. Simply trace the sides and top of your weapon with a marker onto the inside of your leather. Rough cut it to be the size of your weapon. Cut it with your razor knife.Place a piece of spare leather between the leather that you’re cutting and the table. This protects your table and your razor blade. Cut it bigger rather than smaller. Cut along the outside of the line that you’ve traced. This way you can match them up and cut them down until they are perfect. It is possible to cut them down more and more, but if you start off by cutting too much off, you can’t add to it.  , After a few hours, go get your holster. It will still be damp, but when you take off the clamps, it should be starting to hold the shape of your mold. Dampen the outer piece of the holster once again. You want it about ¾ as damp as the original time that you dampened it. This means it will be wet, but won’t leave water on your hand when you touch it., Use the empty weapon instead of your mold this time. It will give the leather a better fit around it. Use your stretching blocks and re-clamp them over your holster with the mold and inserts inside. Place your holster back in the sun to dry., The longer you let it sit and dry, the better shape it will hold on its own. If you don’t let the leather set in the proper position, your weapon won’t fit correctly. This could cause it to fall out of the holster, or it could create difficulty for you when trying to get it out., When your leather dries, you should see that is has stretched tightly around your weapon. You’ll be able to see where the sights (the clip on the top of the gun) are by a noticeable bump in the leather on the top of your gun., Clamp your blocks with the holster and top insert between them to help the glue take.  Scuff the leather with a knife to help the glue hold a little bit better.  , This glue will dry quickly: 5-10 minutes is all it takes. When it is dry, remove the clamps. With your top insert glued in, wrap your leather around your weapon once again to check the fit., You’re going to stitch your insert to your holster with your needle and heavy string. Using the pronged punch will help to create the stitching holes will make it possible for you to get the needle through the leather. If you don’t use one, it will be too difficult to get the needle through.  A pronged punch looks like a fork. Simply place it with the prongs facing into the leather, lined up where you want to make indents. Hold it steady and hit the top of the punch with your hammer. The prongs will go into the leather, but not all the way through. Pull the punch out and continue doing this all the way around your insert.  , Go through your stitch holes with the needle and string until your top insert is permanently secure. Start wherever you’d like on your holster and go all the way around. Finish is the same stitch hole that you started in.  Knot your string onto your needle to make it easier for you. This will take a lot of strength to get the needle through the leather. Keep using the guide-holes that you made with your pronged punch. If you miss a hole, take the needle back through the way it came and fix it. Your leather will pull unevenly if you don’t.  , To finish your stitching, stitch through your original hole twice. This will help your stitch hold strongly for the life of your holster., Let the glue dry for 5-10 minutes again. Again, use the prong and your curved needle and string to stitch these inserts to your holster., When you fold your leather down, you’ll still have extra fabric on the bottom. With your weapon in the leather, fold it over and glue the leather in place. Don’t be afraid of getting the glue on your weapon—it will come off. Use your clamps one more time to help secure the glue., Once the glue dries, test out how your weapon will pull out of the holster. If it is a snug fit, you can sew this last part together. Once again, take your prong and make stitch indents around the shape of the bottom of your weapon.  If you make the stitch too close to where your weapon sits, you won’t be able to fit your weapon in your holster. If you need to, you can keep the weapon in the holster while you stitch the remaining side. #Clean you edge. After this stitching is done, use your knife to finish shaping your holster. Be sure to leave 1/8” of leather from your stitching so that your stitching doesn’t get loosened over the years.  , If you wish, you can buy leather dye and dye your holster. This is only for cosmetic purposes, and totally up to you., This should be 1 ½” wide and long enough to go around your shoulders and meet in the middle of your back. An easy way to measure this is to make a figure eight and putting your arms through it. This is usually going to be from 35”-48”. , This is going to sit on the center of your upper back. Sew the middle of the long strap to the bottom of the rectangle., Do the same with the left side of the strap. This is going to form your arm loops., If you’re a righty, use your leather cement to attach your holster to the left shoulder strap. Put the straps on and mark where you’d like to have the holster. Once it’s marked, take the straps off and use your cement to attach it. Use your clamps and let it sit for at least 10 minutes while the cement dries.  Attach your holster in a place that is concealed, comfortable, and in easy reach., The leather cement will hold your holster in place. However, if you wish to add extra support, you can use another strip of leather. Place a small strip of leather (no more than 3”) and lay it on your holster, over the strap. Stitch this strap onto both the holster and the strap.  It will take a lot of strength to attach this strap because you will be going through up multiple layers of leather. Be sure to use your prong punch and hammer to create insertion holes for the stitches.

Or maybe it's more a more general goal to be a better family member or a happier person. Either way, the path toward meeting your goals will be more clear if you take the time to do some deep thinking and preparation.   If you have a specific goal in mind, plot out a course to help you reach it. Do research to find out what steps you need to take along the way. If it's helpful, create a schedule that will help you meet your goal. Give yourself a deadline for each step along the way. Whatever your goal, prepare to put in some time and work. Developing the mental strength to persevere takes a lot of practice, but you can start right now.; , The first hurdle you're likely to encounter is correcting the state of your own self-confidence. It's really difficult to make progress unless you believe you're capable of persevering. No matter how unobtainable your goals may seem now, you have the intelligence and power to get there. If your goal is to overcome problems and face life's troubles with grace, you can do that, too.   Don't compare yourself to other people. Doing so will inevitably lead to self doubt. You have the power to persevere using your unique strengths and talents, and your process is going to be different from other people's. If there are things in your life that hurt your confidence, get rid of them. For example, if you tend to fall back on harmful habits like drinking, abusing drugs or eating only junk food, this will make it harder to see yourself as a person with the mental toughness to persevere. Take steps to end addictive behaviors and bad habits. Spend time doing things you're good at. Practicing your skills, like playing a sport, making art, cooking, reading, knitting, or gardening, is a great way to build up your confidence. Spend time doing things that make you feel satisfied and positive about life.  , Getting hung up on stressful but small incidents takes a lot of energy - energy that could be going toward something more productive. Part of persevering is mastering the ability to let go of the little things. It's a lot easier said than done, but you can start practicing right away. Next time you find yourself in a long line or a traffic jam, or you start to heat up over a silly comment someone made, practice staying chill using the following technique:   Think before speaking or acting. Give a few minutes to think it through before you do anything. Think about how small this issue is in the grand scheme of things. While you're thinking, feel the anger or irritation move through your body, then feel it subside. Take five deep breaths. Breathe so that your stomach distends when you inhale, then pulls in when you exhale. Breathe in through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Move on with your day, dealing with the situation in a cool and appropriate manner. If you're in a line, wait patiently for your turn (and don't berate the person working the desk when you get to the front). If someone made an annoying comment, respond with a smile and let it go. You have more important things to spend your energy on.  , As you walk the path toward your goal, or just work on persevering in daily life, you might encounter people who question you or tell you you won't get far. Don't let it weigh you down. Realize that people are usually negative as a result of their own problems and issues they're dealing with.   If the goal you're trying to reach is a big one, like climbing Mount Everest, you'll encounter people who tell you you can't do it. This is all par for the course. Have faith in yourself, and think ahead to the moment when you'll be able to prove them wrong. If there are people in your life who are particularly negative and seem bent on preventing you from achieving, it's ok to either stop spending time with them or limit how much you see them.  , Having a good grasp of your own personal values is how you figure out the best way forward in any given situation and keep you aimed toward your target. What are your core beliefs? What do you stand for, and how does that play out in your life? The answers to these questions don't come easily, but with each life experience, you'll get closer to understanding yourself and your view of the world. These things can also help:   Read up on a lot of different perspectives. Even if you feel very strongly about a certain issue, get the other side of the story. Gain as much knowledge as you can on subjects about which you care. If you're religious, delve deep into the teachings of your religion. Have conversations about ethics and morality.  Meditate. Explore your own mind and learn how to listen to your conscience.  , Perseverance can mean putting in countless hours of excruciatingly difficult or boring work. However, in the knowledge that you're putting in this time to meet your goals, life will have a predominantly positive tint. You're not just getting through life, you're making the most of it. If dread and resentment have creeped in, and you're not enjoying the challenge anymore, you might want to change your tack.   This is not to say that life won't sometimes be upsetting on the path to your goals. Over time you'll recognize the difference between temporary frustration and longer-term negativity. What tools do you have at your disposal to help yourself feel more positive? For example, you could make a weekly coffee or phone date with your best friend so you have someone to lend an ear when things are hard, or you could schedule time for a long run with your dog to give your mind time to relax.  , Having the ability to stare life's challenges in the face is a big advantage, but it can be really difficult to do. When a big problem arises, it's so much easier to ignore it, sugarcoat it, or put off making a decision. Practice seeing obstacles for what they are so you can figure out the best way around, over or through them.   Be truthful with yourself. If you've strayed from the path toward your goal, own up to it. For example, if your goal is to become a published author, and you haven't set aside time to write, face the facts instead of making excuses for yourself. Don't place blame where it doesn't belong. You haven't started your couch to 5k program because your boss gives you too much work, your kids have been keeping you up, or it's too cold outside - does this sound like you? Remember the power you have to take action in your life, and use it to move forward, even if you have to start again at square 1. Avoid escapism. Big problems can be temporarily eluded by turning to alcohol, TV, drugs, overeating, constant video game-playing - but only temporarily. If you find yourself putting things off until tomorrow because you're too busy to face what matters, the problem will just fester in the meantime.  , Making careful, reasoned decisions instead of rash ones will get you further, faster. Each time you encounter an obstacle, examine the issue from all angles before you take action. There's always more than one way to handle a problem, and you want to figure out which path makes the most sense without taking any shortcuts.   Get advice from those with wisdom. Other people can be a huge help when it comes to making big decisions. If you know people who've been through it before, ask them how they handled the situation. Just remember to take other people's advice with a grain of salt, especially if they're somehow invested in the outcome. It may also be helpful to have a few role models - people in your life, celebrities, religious figures - with values that align with yours. Asking yourself what those people would do in a given situation could help point you in the right direction.  , It's the ultimate deciding factor. What do you believe is the right thing to do? Acting with your conscience as your guide is always the best decision, even if it brings about an apparent setback. When you act according to your conscience, you can be confident you did your very best. If doubt or confusion set in later, the knowledge that you acted according to your conscience will help you get through.   Sometimes the right path is clear, and other times it's murky. Do what you need to do to see clearly, whether that's meditating, going to a religious service, writing in a journal, or another activity that helps you sort through your thoughts.  , After you make a decision that you know is right, back it up with all you've got. Follow through in the face of criticism, hardship and self doubt. It takes courage to act on your beliefs, especially when they aren't popular. But you can draw strength and confidence from the knowledge that you weighed the options carefully and acted based on your own steadfast beliefs.  , You won't always find your way on the first try. Wisdom is gained by making lots of mistakes and trying something different the next time around. Reflect on what happened and figure out what you can take away from the experience, then apply what you learned next time you have another obstacle to face down.   Even the strongest people have failures. Don't fall into a pattern of beating yourself up when something goes wrong. Instead, plot a new strategy for pursuing your goal, knowing it'll turn out differently next time.  , When your mind is cloudy and your body's out of shape, it can be a lot harder to get through tough times and reach your goals. Taking daily measures to stay healthy will go a long way toward helping you persevere. Here are a few things to keep in mind:   Eat a wholesome diet. Make sure you're getting plenty of nutritious, in-season vegetables and fruits. Eat whole grains, meat, and healthy fats. Try not to eat too many processed foods. Get plenty of sleep. A full night's sleep can make the difference between having a bad day and a great one. Get 7 to 8 hours nightly whenever possible. Move your body. Whether you like walking, yoga, running, biking, swimming, or another activity, move around as much as you can. Exercise puts you in a good mood and keeps you in shape for whatever life may throw at you. Trying a regimen of exercising for 30 minutes daily is a great place to start.  , Surround yourself with people who know you and will support you as you work to meet your goals. Support other people, too, so you're an integral part of your community. Be someone others can turn to, and don't be shy to turn to them when you need help.   Be a dependable son, daughter, sibling, parent, and friend. Having close ties with family and friends will see you through the darkest times. Get involved in the community where you live. Volunteering, taking classes, going to town hall meetings, and cheering on your local teams are all great ways to feel like you're part of something bigger.  , Instead of just getting by minute to minute, day to day, take a longer view. Know that each trial will eventually pass, and do your best to get through it with grace and strength, so that you can be proud of how you performed later on, when you're looking back. Understand that while your problems matter, they don't matter more than other people's. Gain a sense of how large the world is, and engage with it as much as you can.   Reading books and articles and following the news can help you stay connected and aware, and put things in perspective. Get out of your head and try to see things through other people's eyes sometimes. Take your niece out for ice cream, or visit your elderly aunt in the nursing home.  , Many people find that honing a sense of being part of something bigger is comforting and energizing. Having a spiritual life can help you find your purpose again when you don't know where to turn.   If you're religious, attend services regularly. If you pray, do it often. Practice meditation and other forms of spiritual awareness. Spend time in natural places, and let yourself experience the wonder of forests, oceans, rivers and open sky.  , You'll persevere if you continue aligning your actions with your values. When something about your life begins to feel wrong, make a change. Continue correcting your course until you meet your goal.

Anything else could be considered lame, and make you look like a lame friend. Sending flowers or gifts is okay, but if you do this kind of thing instead of talking to your friend face to face then you're just hiding behind gifts. And flowers aren't going to pipe up and say ""I'm sorry."" If you want your apology to sound sincere, then no expensive gift or ornate bouquet is going to beat a face-to-face meeting.If your friend is really far away, then call or Skype them. It's not perfect, but it is way better than ignoring things until you see each other again.; , Is it pretty minor, like not showing up to your friend's party when you said you would, or is it something serious, like hooking up with your friend's boyfriend? If it's minor, then you should act fast and apologize to your friend as soon as you both have some free time. Just get it done with. If your friend needs some time for her wounds to heal, then give her a few days to calm down -- your apology isn't going to mean much if they want to beat the crap out of you whenever they see you talking.   You should know your friend better than most people. Is he or she the kind of person who needs a lot of time to cool off, or who forgives pretty easily? How bad was it last time you hung out? If you know your friend is going to be under an incredible amount of stress or is dealing with something personal, then just chill out and hold on. Your apology, remember, is about them, not about you.  , Apologies should be heartfelt. But they should also tick off the following boxes:   Taking full responsibility for what you've done. Noticing how it's made the other person feel. Including the words ""I'm sorry."" Showing how grateful you are for the friendship. Planning to make things up or be better next time.  , When you find that it's time to apologize, don't dilly dally and wait for your friend to approach you. If your friend approaches you about what you've done, then you already run the risk of looking like a wimp or a bad friend, so strike while the iron is hot (but when your friend has cooled off). Make apologizing to your friend a priority. If you don't care about doing it quickly, why do you even want to apologize?   Apologies can be hard. But they're necessary. Get over your fears and pride and remember that you hurt someone you love.  , If you really want to apologize to your friend, then you have to accept full responsibility for what you have done to him or her. If you don't think you should really apologize, are mad at your friend for doing something else, or think that your friend is overreacting and being dramatic, then don't even bother. You either apologize fully or you don't apologize at all -- got it?Say something like, ""I know I really let you down when I didn't go to your birthday party. I know how much it meant to you."" You can also say, ""I am so sorry that I kissed your crush last week. I don't know what I was thinking, and I've been kicking myself over it ever since. Your friendship means way more to me than a dumb boy."" If you're making excuses during your apology, you're a bad friend. End of story. Don't say, ""I'm sorry that I didn't go to your party, but..."" Giving an excuse for what you did is worse than not apologizing at all because it implies you're not really that sorry.  , That's right. This is the most important part. Suck it up and spit it out. Say, ""I'm really sorry that I did that."" Or, ""I'm really sorry that I..."" Make it clear that you are sorry about something that you've done to hurt your friend. This may be the hardest task, so take a deep breath, make eye contact with your friend, and say that you are really sorry.   Don't say something like, ""I'm sorry that you were so upset..."" This is some terrible, passive aggressive crap that basically blames them, not you. Like making excuses, it makes you a bad friend.  , After you accept responsibility for what you've done and have said that you were sorry, you have to acknowledge that you really hurt your friend. Show them that you're aware of how you have made your friend feel. This will make your friend see that you have put a lot of thought and effort into considering every angle of what you've done and that you feel really terrible about your actions.   Say something like, ""I can't imagine how disappointed you were when I didn't show up to your birthday party. You have been planning it for such a long time and I know you wanted it to be perfect."" Or, ""I know you were incredibly hurt when I kissed Collin. You have had a crush on him for months and must have been heartbroken.""  , Let your friend see that your friendship is more important than anything else in the world and that you know you need to redefine your priorities in the future. Your friend should see that whatever you did wasn't worth it and that you wish that you could start over and put your friend first in mind instead. Be humble and honest. This isn't the time for lame half-truths like, ""you know I'm your friend."" This is the time for ""I'm your friend, but I didn't act like it. I will from here on out.""   Say, ""I missed your birthday party. I shouldn't have done that. I made a commitment to you and dropped it, but I won't take my promises so lightly again."" Say, ""I can't believe what I did with Collin. He means nothing to me and you mean everything to me. Our friendship is more important to me than any romantic relationship.""  , Again, don't try and buy them out with fancy things. Things don't create friendships, conversations do. Take them out for dinner, make plans to hang out soon, and return to friendship. This is your friend, and it shouldn't be hard to make time for them if you really care about their feelings.Say, ""I'll never flake on you again. I won't leave you high and dry in the future. When I say I'll be somewhere, I'll be there. Let me take you out to a private birthday party at the movies/dinner/the park/laser tag/etc."" Say, ""I'll never try to even flirt with someone you have a crush on. I know how much your crushes mean to you and I won't interfere with your romantic life again.""  , After you've said all of the things you've had to say, ask your friend, ""Will you forgive me?"" Hopefully, your friend will see how much your friendship means to you and will forgive you right away. Then you can hug, show how happy you are, and be relieved that you made it through the apology. And if your friend needs a little more time and won't forgive you, at least you can tell yourself that you tried. There is little more you can do than offer a sincere apology. If they don't take it, that is on them, not you, and you shouldn't keep pushing them to forgive you -- it won't work.   A simple ""Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?"" will mean the world. No one likes asking for forgiveness, that's what makes it so meaningful when you do! Don't skip this step just because you're too proud -- it's important.  , When writing you letter, make sure it's sincere and apologetic. This could also be a good idea if they're too angry to see you in person. Make sure, however, that you write that you want to see them in person -- don't hide behind a letter or an email. You have to do this face to face sooner or later.  , This is a more dramatic peace offering, but it can help make your friend feel better and like you've really made an effort. Include a small card that also says your sorry so your friend feels more special. Not everyone will be impressed, though, and this can be seen as your attempt to cover up something you did. The workaround? Don't let it be a cover up -- you still need to see them in person!  , If you and your friend live far apart, then the best way to apologize may be over the phone. Just call your friend, be sincere, and do the same things you would do in person: accept responsibility, apologize, promise to never do it again, ask for forgiveness, etc. This may be a little harder because it'll be more challenging to read your friend and see how he or she is actually feeling.   Stay on the line when you're done, letting the conversation turn to other topics, like old friends would. Don't apologize over voicemail -- it is just tacky and insincere. If they don't call you back, too bad. They're not ready for the apology, and you need to go in person.  , If you're really sorry for something you've done, then sending a text message or Facebook message just isn't going to cut it. This is pretty impersonal and doesn't show much effort on your part. Sure, it's harder to suck it up and call the person or talk to him or her face to face, but this shows that you actually care about the friendship. Apologies are about you being sorry for your mistakes -- it is your job, therefore, to go apologize in person like a grown man or woman would.",1666,"['way', 'pride', 'flowers', 'events', 'person', 'forgiveness', 'friend', 'txt', 'apology', 'full responsibility', 'faults', 'tension', 'friendship', 'friend feel', 'tempers', 'fb', 'phone', 'letter']"

The first thing is to get over heartache or past love, accept the loss, and start to come to terms with it. This takes time. It’s also hard. But, you’ll never be able to move on if you don’t stop to grieve.Make the choice to let go. Say to yourself, “It’s over and I need to move on.” Otherwise, you may end up sabotaging your future efforts. Express your pain. Part of grieving is emotion! Let it out directly, vent to a friend, or write it out in a letter that you’ll never send to your ex. Forgive. This is a key part of moving on. It doesn’t mean forgetting what happened, but choosing to release your hurt and anger and move forward.; , Grieving is totally natural, but try not to get carried away. Take ownership for the past and don’t cast yourself as a victim in love. After all, you played a part in your relationships.While grieving, acknowledge your role in the heartbreak. Ask yourself, “Did I go wrong? How? What could I have done differently?” Self-pity is easy and feels good. Resist it. Say, “I’m not going to keep feeling bad about someone else and what they did; I’m going to start to feel good.”  , As said, coming to terms with the past isn’t easy. But you need to be honest and confront it head-on, rather than letting things fester. Do some serious self-examination. Look at your personal qualities with an eye to self-improvement.List your strengths and weaknesses. Write down things – qualities, talents, habits, ticks – that you consider to be strengths, like generosity or emotional openness. Then, list weaknesses. Are you a natural pessimist, for example? Maybe you are stingy with money? Note common elements. Do you always tend to love the same type of people? Are there mistakes, patterns, or repeated dynamics in your past relationships? Try to find and identify what they are.  , You may be hurting, but try to see it as an opportunity to learn about yourself and what can and will make you happy in the future. Finding true love is hard, to be sure, and not guaranteed. But you’ll have a better shot with better self-understanding.Remember things as they were. Don’t idealize your past loves, but distinguish what made the relationship exciting and memorable from what caused it to fail. Be hopeful and open to love. One heartbreak doesn’t mean that you won’t ever love again, but you have to let it happen.  , Whether you are long single or getting over heart-break, try to value your independence. Remember that you don’t need true love to make you happy, because happiness comes from inside. It’s OK (and healthy) to focus on yourself sometimes.Being single comes with freedom: you can do the things you enjoy, when you want to. Do you want to go for a swim at 6:00 every morning? Sure thing. Do you like to sit around and watch TV in sweatpants after work? Go right ahead! Being independent gives you the chance to be selfish, too. Focus on your career and work long hours, if you’re ambitious. Or, spend more time on your hobbies and friends. Use the time for self-exploration, too. Being single, you can spend energy figuring out your needs rather than on those of a partner.  , Some of us already have a clear vision of true love, while others need some time to figure it out. You may have a sense of what you’re looking for, but need time to articulate your ideal partner.Start with your core needs. What things are “must haves”? Do you need a partner who shares your social or religious values? Who wants a family? Who understands and validates your career?Learn to understand your own emotional needs. Think of earlier relationships and what made you feel fulfilled and what didn’t. You might need good chemistry, for example, but you also might need loyalty or a strong intellectual connection. Be aware that true love isn’t a magic potion. It can’t make you feel worthwhile, happy, or whole in life, at least not by itself. These things ultimately have to come from inside of you.  , Remember that self-examination? Start to act on it. Figure out what positive qualities you’ve got going, but also those you need to work on. Set up clear goals to aspire and work toward.Write your goals down. What do you want to be better at? Do you need to be a better listener? To show more empathy? Or perhaps to be more generous with your time? Ask yourself whether each goal is realistic, achievable, and about you as a person. Make sure that the goals are also worded positively. That is, they should be about getting better and not at removing something from your life. Write that you want to get better at expressing emotion, and not that you want to be less cold to others. Set a time-frame and list specific things that you are doing or will do to address each goal. To be more generous with your time, for instance, you might say that you will volunteer at a soup kitchen once a month for the next three months. Set your list in a visible place. Put it on your mirror, your fridge door, or in your office to see. Keep it close so you can see it every day.  , Try to be the best person you can, in mind, spirit, and body. That said, pay attention to your health as you better yourself. Eat good food, sleep well, rest, and reduce stress. Your health is important in preparing yourself for true love. Make it a priority.Exercise, a good diet, and rest will give you more energy and vim and put you in a positive frame of mind. Aim for a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and lean meats, for example. Take up an exercise routine. Doctors recommend at least 130 minutes of moderate activity per week for optimal health. This will help if you’re still healing from heartache, releasing feel-good, depression-beating endorphins. Exercise will not only make you healthy and happier, but it can also help you manage stress and boost your self-confidence around other people – all important in finding a partner., Finding someone special – maybe even a true love – takes a resolution on your part. You have to put yourself on the line, to get out there and meet people. But are you ready? Take some time to self-assess before making the plunge.Have you properly grieved? Did you take the time to come to terms with your earlier losses in love? If not, you might be acting for the wrong reasons. Are you happy on your own? Looking for someone to “make you happy” or fill a void in your life is usually a bad idea. Have you let go of any lingering anger? Are you emotionally open to a relationship? If you’ve said yes to these questions, there’s a good chance that you are really ready to start meeting new people.  , There are tons of ways to meet people and connect. Start with places where you’re more likely to find others with shared interests or views. Clubs and group activities are great for this reason. The common ground will also mean you don’t have to worry as much about breaking the ice.Sign up for ballroom dance lessons, for example. You’ll learn great moves and get to boogie with many different partners. Try a book club at your local library, alternatively. Read and discuss interesting novels at monthly or weekly meetings. Are you artistic? Sign up for painting or sculpting at a local college, or an art appreciation course at your nearest art museum. Take a language course. Have you always wanted to learn Italian? Sign up for lessons – you’ll meet new and very interesting people.  , Nowadays online dating has gone mainstream. In fact, nearly half of Americans know someone who is using an online dating service or who met a partner online. It’s becoming common for most age groups, even people in their 40s, 50s, and up.Sign up for a service like Match.com or OKCupid. Most use metrics to try to match you with people who share not just interests but also values and outlook. One of the big pros of online dating is that you can, potentially, meet a lot of new people. You can also filter them out. On the other hand, the choice might be a bit overwhelming. Plus, your potential dates are not always accurate in their personal descriptions.  , While the rise of internet dating has cut into tradition venues like bars and clubs, people do still meet each other face-to-face. There are plenty of other places and ways to make new friends and meet new people, without a computer screen standing between you.Blind dates can be spotty, but they sometimes work out. Ask a friend to set you up or, if you need more assurance, try a professional dating agency. You might also consider signing up for a singles holiday. There are plenty of companies that offer getaways aimed at singles and encouraging romance. Are you a romantic at heart? Why not place a classified ad? “SM seeks SF with a good sense of humor for romantic walks on the beach and fireside chats.”  , Love builds from friendship in most cases. Most everyone wants to be friends with the person they date. If you're looking for true love, start out by building a genuine friendship and a relationship based on affection, shared values, and mutual respect.   Let intimacy grow naturally. You might feel ready for it right away or it might take a while. The important thing is not to rush it. Don’t be afraid to fall in love. If a person makes you feel fulfilled and happy, they may be the right material.

Give the bear to one child, and encourage that child to pass it on to another child. Point out how nice it is to share with friends. This is also a great game to play when two children are finding over a toy: encourage the child holding onto the toy to ""share"" it with the other child and encourage the other child to ""share"" it back with the person who gave it to his/her., Saying the same things over and over (""God loves you!"" and ""God made you!"") are great ways to instill those words into a child., Saying comforting words to a child who is tired, hurt, or sad helps the child begin to trust and feel comfortable with you. This also helps the child take another step toward trusting Jesus. If a child has just been hurt, try words such as ""It will feel better soon."" or ""Everything will be alright soon."" Words to a tired child might include ""Shhh, I know you're tired, but everything will be alright."", Cradle roll consists of songs and props. Almost every song has a prop or toy that is associated with it. Sometimes, every child gets a prop or toy to hold onto, and sometimes, the teacher just gets to hold something for everyone. Normally, children sit around a crescent-shaped table in seats while the teacher sits on the opposite side of the children. Cradle roll works for both infants and toddlers, although some verses may accommodate a specific age group better., Place all the children in seats or chairs. Have your props organized in boxes beside you. Consider writing songs on notecards and laminating them to have for every class., Sing this to the tune of ""Are You Sleeping?"" while pretending to ""look"" for every child and then finding them while peering through a paper towel tube: ""Where is (child's name)? Where is (child's name)? Did he/she come? Did he/she come? Come to cradle roll class, come to cradle roll class. There he/she is! There he/she is!"", Sing this to the tune of ""If You're Happy and You Know It"": ""Did you come to church in a car? Did you come to church in a car? Did you come to church, did you come to church, did you come to church in a car?"", Sing ""The B-I-B-L-E"" as you let each child gently pat a Bible. Emphasize how special the Bible is and how we must carefully turn the pages and carefully pat it., You don't have to go in order of days, just try the following ideas.  Glue a cotton ball to a popsicle stick. Sing the following to the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" as children feel the ""cloud"": ""Fluffy, fluffy, little clouds; God made you so very proud. Up above the world so high, Like a lamb in the sky. Fluffy, fluffy, little clouds; God made you so very proud."" Mix a bouquet of fake and real flowers together. Hold them up to each child to smell as you sing this to the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"": ""Thank you God for the flowers that grow; Thank you God for the pretty rose. Thank you God for a daisy that's white; What a very pretty sight. Thank you God for the flowers that grow; Thank you God for the pretty rose."" Attach glow-in-the-dark stars to the ceilings of your nursery. For infants under six months, glue the same stars that you glued to your ceiling onto a black glove. place the glove on your hand and position it above the infant's head. Encourage everyone older than 6 months to look up at the ceiling as you sing ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" but instead of singing ""How I wonder what you are"" sing ""God has put you where you are."" Purchase a plastic toy fish for every child. Let them suck on their fish as you sing this song to the tune of ""The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round"": ""God made the fish to swim, swim, swim; swim, swim, swim; swim, swim, swim. God made the fish to swim, swim, swim; swim, swim, swim like this."" Let children place their fish in the water after you're done singing or play with the fish in the water for added fun. Give children a toy animal that is preferably plastic. Sing this song to the tune of ""The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round"" for every different kind of animal as kids play: ""God made the (animal's name) to (something animal does), (something animal does), (something animal does); (something animal does), (something animal does), (something animal does); (something animal does), (something animal does), (something animal does). God made the (animal's name) to (something animal does), (something animal does), (something animal does); (something animal does), (something animal does), (something animal does) like this.""  , Try out these few ideas:  Give every child a baby doll to hold and rock as you sing this to the tune of ""Rock a Bye Baby"": Rock a Bye baby, God loves you so. He will never, let you go. God made you, and God made me; now go to sleep my dear baby."" Hold out an unbreakable mirror for all children to see themselves in as you sing this verse to the tune of ""The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round"": You're a pretty little (girl/boy) and God made you; God made you, God made you. You're a pretty little (girl/boy) and God made you; with (a feature of the child such as hair or eye color) too!  , A caring environment can make a lasting impression on both child and parent. Train all workers to smile, be friendly and keep the conversation focused on the child and parent. Play music softly in the background., Cleanliness and safety show whether you care or not. Read How to Keep the Church Nursery Safe and How to Keep the Church Nursery Clean to make sure that you're keeping up with both. Who wants to be in a nursery with a stinky diaper smell or visible dirt and dust? Keep kids and parents coming back so that you can continue to help them grow in God's Word by keeping things both clean and safe.  Keep things looking attractive. An attractive nursery is an awesome nursery in the minds of children and their parents. Follow the below steps to make sure that your nursery is always looking attractive: Choose how you paint carefully. The wall color could be a common light blue which has a benefit: it's a calming color. Or you could choose a more modern red which would make parents think ""clean!"" and ""updated!"" Consider having an artist paint a mural of Jesus and children, Noah's ark or another work of art on the wall. Hang ribbons from the ceilings. Ribbons in pale colors add beauty and give newborns something to look at. Make everything as neat as the first time a couple takes their newborn baby into the baby's room. Everything is perfectly neat and put there with love. Leave your nursery looking like that after every use. All toys should be updated and modern. Electronic toys, brightly colored toys and toys recently made will catch a child's eye and make parents think of your nursery as an up-to-date place rather than unsafe because it's so outdated. Neatly group toys on low shelves. Low shelves will be at a child's eyesight making them feel welcomed. Provide the right equipment: high chairs, cribs, changing tables, a device that plays music, glider rockers, bottle warmers, baby bouncers, activity seats and children's tables are all necessary when caring for children. Follow the steps in How to Keep the Church Nursery Clean after each use!  , Train all volunteers to properly care for infants and toddlers. Whether you're feeding a child, changing a diaper or even just carrying a toddler, there is a proper way to do it and incorrectly following a procedure may lead to a loss of trust from a child. Read the following articles to gain knowledge of how to properly care for the kids in your nursery:  How to Change a Diaper  How to Bottle Feed Babies  How to Hold a Baby  How to Feed a Baby or Infant Solid Food   , Yes, discipline is part of an important nursery ministry. Although it may cause you to think of punishment and crying kids, discipline, especially discipline in a church nursery, shouldn't be any of those things. Your primary goal is to keep all children safe and to help them learn about what God wants us to behave like. Take these steps to help little ones do the right thing and to help your nursery volunteers know how to handle discipline:  Read books to children about Christian behavior. Look for those that emphasize why we are to behave like this and how things turn out better if we do. Create a short list of clear, concise rules for older toddlers to follow. A list of rules that looks like the following with colored pictures posted at a child's eye level where you can weekly review them is the best: Share with friends. Never hit, bite, kick or punch. Use kind words. Listen to the nursery volunteers(volunteer's names) and do what they say. Tell the truth. Play games such as ""The Sharing Bear"" that review good behavior. Prevent bad behavior by having a clean-up song to sing when picking up toys, hanging a mobile over the changing table and keeping activities fun and active. If children start to fight over a toy, start playing ""The Sharing Bear"" before they explode. Praise children for their efforts to do the right thing. Offer alternatives. Say ""You can't bite friends, but you can bite this food"" or ""You can't hit other friends but you can hit this pillow."" Sometimes going into a quiet corner with a child and reading a book for a few minutes to help them calm down is a good idea. If a child hurts another child, have one volunteer comfort the child that was hurt and have another volunteer take the child who hurt the other child and have a one-minute conversation with them. Say something like ""God doesn't want us to bite our friends. That hurts. You can ask for the toy back and tell me if someone isn't sharing, but you can't bite."" The child who hurt the other child may need to refrain from using that toy for the rest of class as a natural punishment for the wrongdoing.  , NEVER force a toddler to apologize. They do not understand that concept.  , Collect Christian baby books, children's Christian storybooks, baby Bibles and toddler Bibles. Read to children individually and in groups. If a child looses interest halfway through a book, that's okay! Just try a different book or come back to it later.,, Mobiles can be hung above a changing table, crib or just on the ceiling.  Twist chenille wires into a circle. Use string to hang a balloon with the mouth and eyes of a fish on it and two clear Christmas ornaments as bubbles equally apart from the chenille wire circle. Tie string in all three places where the fish and bubbles are, and connect the strings above the mobile. Use a nail to push all of the string connected together into the ceiling. Say ""God made the fish to swim"" as you gently turn the mobile. Purchase state-of-the-art mobiles form companies such as Fisher Price. Look for animals or people that you can point out who made them.  , Take a paper plate and use a permanent marker to draw six sections on it. Print out pictures of Jesus, food, water, parents, toys and the Bible. Glue one of each in each section. Point to a picture with the child, and say ""Thank you God for (food)."" Just point to an object and say these words for an infant but try to make things a bit more challenging for a toddler. Ask them to point to something and tell you what it is. Then, ask them who gave that thing to them. Thank God for His blessings., Prayer can be very powerful. Praying for the children in your nursery outside volunteering on Sunday's is very special and important. Praying with children is just as important, though. Pray a short prayer over infants and encourage toddlers to fold their hands and close their eyes with you. Say a short prayer, no longer than a couple sentences. Emphasize that you are talking to god and that He hears you.",2547,"['books', 'animal circle', 'tots', 'use laundry baskets', 'use comforting words', 'welcome song', 'creation', 'game', 'color', 'activities', 'notecard', 'others', 'take-home gift', 'parents', 'bible', 'bear', 'proper childcare', 'get-go', 'glue', 'little ones', 'use mobiles', 'wonderful bubbles', 'lap', 'work wonders', 'teaching young ones', 'durable mirror', 'variation', 'use simple games', 'god', 'savior', 'baby', 'cradle roll', 'child', 'safe environment', 'much god', 'toy car', 'natural punishments', 'multiple warnings', 'pictures', 'something', 'children', 'families', 'nursery', 'babies', 'classic nursery game', 'case', 'peekaboo', 'jesus', 'front', 'special god']"
"['learn the lingo', 'decide between a direct-drive and belt-driven record player', 'decide what kind of features you want', 'only consider turntables with replaceable parts', 'figure out how much you’re willing to spend', 'buy a good cartridge', 'always inspect used turntables', 'talk to record store clerks for advice', 'make sure you have a good-quality stereo to use your turntable with', 'purchase a phono pre-amp', 'get record cleaning supplies', 'get a 45 gap spacer', 'get some vinyl records']",How to Buy a Turntable," Before you start shopping around, it's important to be able to understand the basic components of a turntable. Make sure that you fully understand the features and can compare the advantages and disadvantages of different brands, models, and styles of turntable.A basic turntable or record player consists of:   A record platter or plate, which is a record-sized circle on which the vinyl record will sit. The platter rotates to spin the record, and is often covered with an anti-static felt or rubber pad on which the record will sit. The stylus of the record player is also sometimes referred to as the ""needle,"" and is the component of the record player that contacts the record itself. The stylus is usually housed in a cartridge, which contains the small wiring and coupling mechanism that connects the stylus to the tone arm. A tone arm can be operated manually or automatically, rotating the stylus onto the record. Good record players will have tone arms that will lift off automatically and return to place when the end of the side is finished playing. The base of the record player contains the internal circuitry and houses the various components. Ideally, turntable bases are secured on anti-shock feet to keep the record from skipping during play.; , Turntables can be divided into two basic categories, in terms of the way that they're operated. For the beginner, the difference may be minuscule, but it's important to understand the different machine-styles, depending on the way you intend to use your turntable.   Direct-drive turntables offer consistent machine-operated speeds that will never need adjusted, and allow dual-directional rotation. If you have any interest in analog DJ “scratching,” you need to buy a direct-drive turntable, or you’re going to be disappointed. Belt-driven turntables isolate the motor to one side of the machine, rotating the platter with an elastic belt. While the belt has a tendency to wear out over time in old turntables, the distance of the motor from the tone arm cuts down on incidental operating noise, making these models whisper-quiet.  , Some turntables are basically a platter and a needle, with few frills or other features. Lots of modern turntables, however, come with a variety of different features that can make a unit more desirable and convenient.   Most turntables should come with a variety of playback speeds, measured by revolutions-per-minute (RPM). Most 12-inch records (large, LP sized) are played at 33 1/3 rpm, while smaller 7-inch singles are played at 45. Old shellac and acetate discs made pre-1950 are usually played at. If you want to play all kinds of records, you'll need to make sure the unit features all these playback speeds.USB ports are a feature on many new turntables, which allow you to direct-line in your record player to your computer and record digital files of your vinyl records. If you've got a big collections of vinyl you want to digitize, these are essential. Tone-arm cueing systems are available in manual and automatic varieties. Some record players are operated by sliding a switch or pressing a button, which activates the tone arm and drops it gently onto the record, while other record players need to be placed onto the groove manually. Automatic cueing systems are very desirable for beginners, since you won't have to fumble around with the delicate stylus. Anti-shock stabilization systems are excellent, especially if you want to take your record player anywhere for DJing events, or keep your record player in a heavy-traffic room. There's nothing worse than a skipping record.  , Some cheap turntables are impossible to get apart, meaning that if a stylus breaks you'll have to scrap the whole unit. Because record players will wear out over time and suffer in terms of sound quality, buying a unit that you'll be able to upgrade is a smart choice. Most mid-range units should allow you to customize the belts, stylus, and the platter, if necessary.   Alternatively, if you’re not interested in making a long-term purchase, cheaper and flimsier turntables can be a good budget option. When it wears out, it’ll just be worn out, but you can get some use out of it in the meantime.  , Like anything, more expensive turntables are generally “better” than cheaper varieties. How much better, though, depends on your own preference for sound and your intentions with your turntable. Decide how much you can spend and set a price range accordingly. From sub-$100 to high-end models in excess of $500, there are a variety of perfectly-listenable models.   A DJ looking to jump to analog live sets might be in the market for a more high-end record player capable of putting out the juice, while teenagers looking to drop a needle on dad’s old record collection probably don’t need to break the bank. If you’ve never purchased a turntable before, don’t overspend. Plenty of record snobs with room-sized collections play their deep cuts on used turntables that sound great. Save your money for vinyl.  , Given the option, going big on a cartridge and spending less on a machine is always the better option. Since the stylus is the part that actual contacts the grooves, it has the most impact on the sound coming out of the speakers. As long as a turntable functions properly, it’ll sound great with a great stylus.   For comparison, a high-quality cartridge only costs about $40. While that might seem expensive for so tiny a component, if you can get away with buying a used machine with a worn out needle for less than a hundred bucks and make it sound brand new, it’s practically a steal.  , Vinyl collecting comes and goes as a hobby, meaning that the market for units, records, and other record-playing equipment can vary widely in price. It's always a good idea to keep an eye on used units to look for deals on high-end equipment that someone else has gotten rid of. If you know how to inspect a record-player, this can be a great option for saving some money.   Ask for a hooked-up demonstration of a record player before you buy it. You should be able to hear it. Bring your own record, so you can be sure of the quality. Check the rotation of the platter. Platters should spin perfectly flush with the base and shouldn't warble as they spin. You can adjust this, but if you're going to spend money on a new unit, you want to make sure you're paying for what you get. A record player with worn-out belts will warble and distort sound. Inspect the quality and the pliability of the belts on a belt-driven record player to be sure the unit is solid. Belts should never be cracked and should return to their shape if stretched.  , Record store clerks have an unfair reputation for snark, but try to give them a chance. Many record stores sell turntables or replacement parts, and many of the clerks will be perfectly willing to dish on local options for shopping, their preferred set-up, and other advice. You won’t know until you ask.  , Most of the time, you won’t be able to just buy a turntable, slap a record on the platter and start rocking out after you plug it in. You need to run a turntable through a multi-channel tuner, or at least a good pair of speakers after running it through a pre-amp. Don't forget to figure your stereo into the equation.   Some new or portable turntables come with built-in speakers. What these lack in quality, they make up for in value. You can usually get a portable record player with no need of pre-amp, speakers, or other equipment for less than $200.  , Pre-amplifiers are used to boost the sound of the record player to appropriate volumes. Most record players, new or used, will need to plug into a phono pre-amp to boost the sound, before direct-lining into the sound system. Some models feature built-in pre-armps, but both budget and high-end record players will mostly need to be paired with a pre-amp, which are available at most good electronics stores, for no more than $25-50.Built-in pre-amps make the process of setting up your record player a whole lot easier. It'll involve a lot of extra audio cables to connect your turntable to the pre-amp, then attach the preamp to the receiver.  , Dust is the enemy of a record collection. If you're investing in a record player for the first time, it's important to learn to care for it and your vinyl records properly. Investing in some basic supplies will help you to keep your records clean and your stylus in good working order.A basic kit to go along with your player and your collection should include:   A felt or microfiber record brush Record cleaning fluid, which is basically a mixture of distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, and detergent Anti-static record sleeves Anti-static plate pad  , 7-inch vinyl singles played at 45 rpm will sometimes have a much-larger hole in the record than a 12-inch record. These need to be played by slotting a plastic gap spacer over the spindle in the center of the record platter, which will sometimes be included with the unit and sometimes not. It's an easy thing to forget about, but it can be frustrating to end up without one if you want to play some singles. Fortunately, they're available online or at most record stores for a dollar or two.  , A good record player is useless without a tasteful collection of your favorite vinyl to play on it. While budget used vinyl is widely available at second-hand record stores, antique stores, resale shops, online venues, and garage sales, there's also a burgeoning new vinyl market to explore. Vinyl's not dead.   Rocker Jack White's successful boutique label Third Man Records puts on a variety of vinyl novelties, including colored vinyl, scented vinyl, picture-discs, and vinyl that plays backward. Record Store Day is a worldwide phenomenon, and can be a great way to get out and check out local record stores in your area. In the spring of each year, hundreds of new limited-run releases are made available to the public. It's the crate-digger's Christmas. Real record collectors are known as crate-diggers and can be found thumbing through the unlabeled boxes in the bottom of libraries, book sales, and garages, looking for unfound gems and diamonds in the rough. Famous collector Joe Bussard (whose collection of 78s is larger than the Smithsonian's) used to pretend to be an exterminator so he had a reason to knock on doors and ask if people had any old records they wanted to get rid of.

Make a commitment to consciously count how many grams of sugar you eat on a daily basis, and limit your sugar to a healthy amount. The World Health Organization recommends eating no more than 25 grams of sugar per day — less than what’s found in a single soft drink.Pace your sugar intake throughout the day by eating foods with a moderate amount of sugar, rather than one sugary food and a lot of sugarless food. Less than 5g of sugar per 100g serving of food is a good, low-sugar product.More than 15g of sugar per 100g serving of food is too high for healthy consumption. If you are going to consume sugar, try to use healthy sugar alternatives like agave syrup, honey, coconut sugar, etc. Natural sugars (while still sugars) are much better for you.; , If you don't want to give up on all sugar, make a weekly chart to keep track of how much sugar you're eating. Decide how much sugar you are going to allow yourself to eat each day, remembering that you should eat no more that 25 grams, maximum.   For instance, on Mondays you might need an extra kick in your morning coffee, so you can allow yourself two sugars in it. If you have have plans to go out with friends on Saturday, allow yourself dessert. You can decide how restricting or not your graph is.  , Cut out or scale back on seemingly “healthy” foods that are actually adding large amounts of sugar to your diet. Look closely at the nutrition labels on all the food in your pantry to see how many grams of sugar they contain; four grams of sugar is equal to a teaspoon of granulated sugar. Even the healthier foods you eat might have surprisingly high sugar contents!   For example, a small cup of packaged applesauce can have 22g of sugar in it! That’s the same as eating five and a half teaspoons of sugar! Other foods likely to be high in sugar include cereals, canned products, juice and canned fruits, flavored dairy products (like yogurt), microwaveable or other ready-made meals, and sodas. If possible, eat non-packaged or canned products. For example, instead of a sugar heavy cereal for breakfast, make old fashioned oatmeal and add fruit to make it sweeter.  , Nutrition labels include a list of ingredients that often call sugar by different names. Know the different aliases for sugar so you can avoid sugar-heavy foods. Ingredients that end in “ose,” like glucose, sucrose, fructose, lactose, dextrose, or maltose, are all forms of sugar. Other common aliases include:   High fructose corn syrup Corn syrup Molasses (Blackstrap molasses is better.—It has had much of the sugar removed as crystals.) Invert, brown, or raw sugar Corn sweetener Syrup  , Some people choose to cut sugary, carbohydrate-rich foods like white rice, bread, pasta, and potatoes out of their diet completely. If that seems too drastic, you can keep them in your diet, but make sure to eat them in moderation. These foods draw you into a cycle of sugar cravings by causing a sudden sugar spike in your system. Your body releases a large amount of insulin to manage the spike, which then causes your blood sugar levels to drop. This, in turn, makes your body crave more sugar, restarting the cycle.The “white” varieties of bread, rice, and pasta are the most dangerous. In place of simple carbohydrates, incorporate complex carbohydrates like sweet potatoes, quinoa, and oats, whole grain bread, brown rice, and whole grain pasta., When you eat out, you have only a limited idea what's going into your meals. When you cook for yourself, you have complete control over what goes into your body. Cook natural products like vegetables, fruits, meats, and grains from scratch rather than preparing boxed meals.   When you eat out, don't feel uncomfortable making special requests. You can ask for your meat grilled instead of fried and your vegetables steamed instead of sautéed in oils. You can use an online nutrient calculator to make sure the ingredients you use in a given meal provide a balanced diet.A balanced diet is really important. It is generally accepted that you should get the following macronutrient percentages:  40% of your calories from protein 40% from carbohydrates 20% from fat   If you actually track your macronutrient intake, you will likely notice that you aren't consuming nearly enough protein, and you are way high on carbohydrates and fat. Apps like My Fitness Pal help you to become aware of what you are putting into your body.  , The sugars in most processed foods are bad for your health, but those found naturally in fruits and in vegetables come packaged with other health benefits. Replace your candy bar with nutrient-packed fruits like bananas and dates. Even when baking, you can replace sugar with fruits! Puree bananas, cooked apples, or cooked butternut squash to sweeten your cakes, ice creams, or smoothies.Many fruits can be baked to make them dessert-like. For example, you can bake an apple and then add cinnamon. And in many packaged cake, cookie, and brownie mixes, you can often substitute apple sauce for some of the ingredients to make it lighter.—Just make sure to check the nutrition label to ensure that the apple sauce has no added sugar.  , Even savory fast foods that don’t taste particularly sweet are often full of refined sugars. For example, a “grilled” or “charbroiled” chicken breast at a fast food restaurant likely achieves that taste with sugar.Fast food chains try to achieve taste as quickly and cheaply as possible and almost always use sugar as a shortcut for good cooking. Instead, eat at a restaurant that spends a little more time on its food, or just cook your own meals at home.   Three out of every four teaspoons of sugar Americans eat is consumed through processed food.Eating out is often inevitable. It will happen from time to time. And, when it does, take the time to look up the menu of the restaurant ahead of time and decide what the healthiest option is. Your body will thank you.  , The ingredient list on a nutrition label lists ingredients in descending order based on how much of of each one is found in the product. If you find sugar (or any of its aliases) listed in the first three ingredients, the sugar content is too high. And, if the nutrition information lists more than one type of sugar in the product, you should avoid that food at all costs.   Be wary of products claiming to be a ""natural"" or ""organic"" substitute for sugar. These sweeteners still have calories, but don't add any nutrients to your diet. ""Reduced-sugar"" products still have sugar in them, and are best avoided. Whatever product was used to replace the original sugar content will most likely be bad for your health as well.  , The average soft drink has nine teaspoons of sugar in it, compared to the World Health Organization recommendation of six teaspoons per day. Diet sodas might not have calories, but they’re still full of artificial sugars that increase the risk for diabetes and obesity.While energy drinks might give you the boost you need to get through the workday, they’re packed with unhealthy sugars. Sugary drinks are such a common pitfall in a modern diet. Some iced teas and sodas have almost half of your recommended daily limit of carbohydrates and sugar. Be conscious of how much sugar you’re drinking! Even healthy, natural juices that have no added sweeteners are packed with naturally occurring fructose. The natural sugars are more healthful, but water is better.  , Eat a good breakfast of toast or whole grain cereals or oatmeal/porridge to keep you going through the day. These release energy slowly, so you will be less likely to crave sugar. You should also get some fat and protein in your breakfast through animal protein from eggs, bacon, sausage, or similar foods.   Avoid sugary cereals an look, instead, for wholesome cereals that brag about having no sugar. Explore the different varieties of porridge you can make, from amaranth to barley. A few blueberries sprinkled on top makes it super delicious!  , Unlike yeast, flour, and fat, reducing sugar won't affect your final product apart from from the taste. Instead of relying on sugar, use various spices to flavor your food—cinnamon and nutmeg, for example.   For cakes, add one fresh piece of fruit rather than sugar. Bananas are often a great addition, even when they're overripe and good for little else! For dessert, use fruit's natural sweetness without added sugar. Poached fruit is always delicious, sprinkled with a spice or served with vanilla custard that is sugar-free. Add fresh, unflavored plain yogurt as a topping to a fruit salad. Other delicious choices include a baked apple or frozen berries. Toasted sprout bread or some bagels with slices of fruit or a thin layer of sugar-reduced jam can be a hearty substitute for candy cravings.  , Soda is a leading cause of sugar-related obesity, so it’s very important that you curb your soda habit if you have one.Switching from regular to diet soda affects calorie intake, but might serve to feed your sugar cravings.   If regular water isn’t enough to keep you happy, try flavoring it with natural flavors.Squeeze some lemon or orange into you water for a citrus drink. Soak cucumber slices or strawberry slices in a pitcher of water for a refreshing, summery glass. You can also buy a water bottle with an infuser to flavor your water. You just add the fruit to the infuser so it keeps the water and fruit separate. Unsweetened teas might give you some of the stronger flavors you crave. Some people miss the feeling of drinking out of a can, in which case a flavored, sparkling water drink might be a good option for you to help kick a soda habit. These drinks have a wide variety of flavors, from lime to pomegranate, but make sure you choose one that has no added sugar.  , Sugary snacks have a habit of sneaking into your daily diet in all sorts of seemingly harmless ways: the morning muffin, the afternoon candy bar, or the evening candies. These soon add up, and mindless munching is not good for your health. To keep yourself satisfied throughout the day, eat healthier snacks like carrot and celery sticks, hummus, a few nuts, or an apple. Be careful of dried fruit; it's full of calories and fructose.  , Don’t put temptation in your path! Keeping sugary treats like cookies, sodas, or white breads around your kitchen will only give you an opportunity to slip sugar into your diet. A cookie here and a stolen sip of soda there will add up over the course of the day. When you make the decision to reduce sugar in your diet, throw out or donate all foods whose nutrition labels mark them as too sugary for your new lifestyle.   This may not be realistic if you live with roommates or family members who don’t share your aversion to sugar. Talk to the people you live with about whether or not they would be willing to alter their diets for their own health. If they don’t want to cut down on sugar, separate your food from the rest of the food in the house. Stake out one shelf in the pantry for your own food, and tell yourself you can only eat from that shelf. Put your food somewhere else completely, where you won’t even have to see your roommates’ or kids’ sugary foods when you want to grab a snack or prepare a meal.  , Humans are just hard-wired to love sugar. Carbohydrates, including sugar, release serotonin in the brain, which makes us feel calm, relaxed, and just overall good when we sugary foods. When you cut sugar out of your diet, you may find yourself in sugar withdrawal, but there are things you can do to fight off your cravings.Wait out your withdrawals. Just like any other addictive substance, you may feel cravings for the first 2 to 3 days after going cold-turkey with sugar. However, if you can stay strong for those first 72 hours, you’ll find your cravings will diminish. Eat something else. You may get sugar cravings when your blood sugar drops too low, likely because you haven’t eaten in some time. Many foods, including vegetables, have sugar in them, though, and you can correct your imbalance without splurging on sugar. Distract yourself by doing something else you enjoy. Listen to your favorite album, take a nice walk, or bury yourself in an interesting task at work. While fruit is a much healthier option, it does still contain sugar. Eating a snack high in protein combined with a healthy fat will help curb cravings and keep you energized. For example, hard-boiled eggs and almonds. Research suggests that chewing gum can effectively fight off sugar cravings. Obviously, look for sugar-free gum!  , People who shop while hungry tend to purchase tasty, but unhealthy products at the grocery store. If you have a sweet-tooth, you’ll be more likely to indulge in your favorite snacks that you would if your hunger was satisfied.   If you’re hungry when you need to shop, eat a snack to tide you over until you can eat a full meal. A small, healthy snack eaten 5 minutes before your shopping trip will prevent you from bringing sugary foods home. Many grocery stores now have options where you can order your groceries ahead of time and pick them up at little cost. This is a great way to control the food that you get in terms of their nutritional value, but it also prevents you from buying things that you just don't need, and in effect saves you money.  , When you cut sugar out of your diet, you’ll likely have strong cravings for at least a couple of weeks. However, if you can push through that initial barrier, you’ll find that your body feels healthier and your mood is improved. A reliance on sugar has been correlated with fatigue, depression, anxiety, poor sleeping habits, and hormonal and digestive problems.Even if you really want one of the free donuts in the break room, think about how much better you will feel once your cravings have passed. Be assured that just like any other ""addiction,"" your severe sugar cravings will get better once your body has adjusted to the absence of sugar.  , Whenever you get a sugar-craving, remind yourself why you’re doing this: sugar is a cause of acne, infertility, certain cancers, osteoporosis, vision loss, and kidney disease. It’s also related to mood swings, depression, fatigue, and memory loss.Research suggests that sugar can cause fatal heart disease even in thin patients who seem outwardly healthy.Moreover, sugar is known as an “empty calorie,” meaning it adds calories to your body without any nutritional value. As such, sugar is closely linked with obesity — more so than even fat content.While the causes of diabetes are complex, Type-2 diabetes is known to be caused by a combination of genetic predisposition and lifestyle choices, including diet.Though eating sugar will not necessarily lead to diabetes, it puts you at a higher risk, especially if you have diabetes in your family. Though not the only cause, sugar is certainly the leading cause of tooth cavities that can be both painful and expensive to treat.Sugary foods can lead to tooth decay or gum disease., If you cut sugar out of your life entirely, you might find yourself thinking about it all the time. Instead, keep your sugar intake within the World Health Organization’s recommendation, which is 25 grams per day, and give yourself a treat once a week. Pick a day when you think you’ll need a treat, and let yourself cheat when you need to. Maybe you need a big, sugary donut breakfast every Monday to prepare for the work week, or maybe you need to unwind with a giant bowl of ice cream when you get home from work on Fridays.   Many dieticians believe that allowing yourself to cheat on any kind of restricted diet improves your chances of sticking to the diet long-term.",2731,"['cut fast food', 'scientific research', 'time', 'flavored water', 'moderate feast', 'meals', 'sugar-related risks.sugar', 'home', 'sugar aliases', 'sugar', 'sugar sources', 'snacks', 'products', 'sugars', 'sugar limit', 'health issues', 'amount', 'soda', 'hungry.this', 'sugar consumption', 'diet', 'common-sense folk wisdom', 'conclusion', 'wide variety', 'carbohydrate intake', 'day', 'sugar cravings', 'sugary foods', 'ingredients', 'breakfast', 'natural ones', 'sugary drinks', 'cooking']"

Though you may feel like you have a lot going on, between school, friends, and your personal life, you should always spend quality time with your parents as often as you can. This can mean having dinner with them every night, having family board game night, watching TV with your folks, or just hanging out around the house instead of running off to hang out with your friends. You’ll never know how much the time you spend with your parents means to them.Moms especially love it when their son will love them.   When you do spend time with them, don’t roll your eyes or act like it’s mandatory. Instead, you should look forward to the special time you have together. Have routine nights where you spend time together, such as Sundays or Monday evenings, so you don’t have to try to work the time into your busy schedule.; , Your parents love you and want to know what’s going on in your life. While they may not need to know all of the daily friend drama in your social circle or the ins and outs of the baseball game you saw with your friends, they would love to know what’s on your mind, from your struggles with your studies to any big problems you’re having with your friends. They really do care, and even if they can’t always help, they’d just like to know what’s happening. Your parents will feel upset if they’re completely shut out of your life.   Try to leave your bedroom door open as often as you can, so you welcome your parents in to have a conversation with you when they want to. Don’t make them feel like you want nothing to do with them. Don’t be afraid to ask for their advice. Believe it or not, your parents were once your age, and they’ve gone through the same struggles that you’re going through. They’ll appreciate that you value their opinions, and you may learn a lot in the process.  , It’s easy to take your parents for granted. After all, there was a time when they did absolutely everything for you, from bathing you to keeping you fed and well-rested. As you grow older, it can feel natural for you to forget the fact that it takes your parents time and effort to take care of you, and you have to remember to thank them for all that they do. Whether you verbally say “thank you” every time your parents do something kind for you, write them thank you cards or letters, call them, or do them favors in return, it’s important to let your parents know how much you appreciate them.Don’t think that it’s pointless for you to write your parents a card or a letter just because you live in the same house. They’ll love the gesture. When you say “thank you,” look into your parents’ eyes to show that you really mean it and that you’re not just saying it because you feel obligated to say it.  , Your parents may not be incredibly tech savvy and may not know some of the things going on in the modern world. If your mom wants to know how to work her new iPhone or your dad wants to start a Facebook account, be there to help your parents learn how to navigate some of these modern challenges. Try not to laugh at them or make them feel inadequate for not knowing these things, and instead, be there to help them learn new skills, remembering all the times they have taught you how to do something.   Teaching them things will make your relationship feel less one-sided. You won’t feel like you always have to learn from them, and your time together may feel more interesting. When you do help them, don’t sigh or complain about it, and show them that you’re happy to help out.  , In addition to spending quality time with your parents around the house, you can also show you care by doing a variety of bonding activities with your parents. These can include going fishing, hiking, or camping with your dad, or going for walks, going out to the movies, or having a nice meal with your mother. Don’t think that all son activities have to be done with your father, and make sure you spend an equal amount of time bonding with your mom, whether you’re cooking, walking your dog together, or spending an afternoon at the library with her.Go on a camping trip with your family a few times a year. Spend the holiday season cooking together. Do a housework project with your mom or dad, such as tiling floors, glazing furniture, or even building a bookshelf. Find a TV show that you and your parents can watch and enjoy together and make it part of your weekly routine. Try volunteering at a local park or library with your parents. Go to watch your favorite sports team with your mom or dad.  , If you want to be a good son, then you should help keep your parents’ relationship strong (if your parents are still together). Relationships are difficult enough as it is, and you shouldn’t try to drive a wedge between your parents. Accept your parents’ rules as a unified mandate, instead of trying to get the more lenient parents to let you get what you want. Work to keep their relationship strong; if nothing else, it’ll make you happier to see your parents happy together.   If you tell your mom, “But dad says it’s okay!” when she won’t let you do something, then you’re only creating friction between your parents by pitting them against each other.  , You may think that your relationship with your parents is one-sided, and that they should listen to you and your problems and offer advice and then call it a day. In fact, sometimes your parents may also need you to listen to them, whether they’re struggling with one of your siblings or having a difficult time at work or with your grandparents. They may not even have a problem, but may just want to share something interesting that happened at work or something they read. The important thing is that you’re there to listen instead of acting like you’re too busy or only half-listening and checking your phone every five minutes. Give them the time they need to tell you what’s on their mind; they more than deserve it.   When your parents are talking to you, give them your full attention. Don’t shift around on your feet or look longingly towards your bedroom. Don’t ever make them feel like you have better things to do than to talk to them.  , You may have a set list of chores to do or there may just be a general understanding that you will help your parents out when they need it. Whatever the rules are in your own household, you should take the initiative and help out your folks even before they ask for it. Whether this means washing your dishes, doing your own laundry, mowing the lawn, or picking up groceries, you should make a point of helping out without being forced to or without expecting a reward, because that is one of your duties as a son.   The least you can do is to always clean up after yourself, whether this means doing your own laundry or dishes or keeping your room clean. But after that, you should go above and beyond and help scrub the bathroom floor, take out the trash, or even clean out the fridge.  , Your parents don’t expect you to be a rocket scientist or to get into Harvard. However, they would be happy if you respected your teachers, did your homework, and kept your grades up to the best of your ability. If you need help in school, ask your teachers or your parents for help, and make studying a priority over socializing. Not only will this set you on a path to succeed in your future endeavors, but it will also make life much easier for your parents.   The best you can do is to respect your learning institution instead of playing hooky or complaining about it all the time. Your parents shouldn’t have to force you to see the value of your education.  , As you grow older, you’ll find that you can’t depend on your parents to do everything for you. Your parents will appreciate that you’re independent and willing to do things on your own — though they’ll still want to love and care for you, of course. Once you’re in the neighborhood of 10-12 years old, you can start thinking about cleaning up after yourself, not asking your mom’s help with basic tasks like laundry or washing dishes, and starting to think for yourself a bit more. This will help you develop strong character and will make you a better son.   Your parents will appreciate it if you learn to do things on your own, from making your own meals to cleaning up on your own initiative. Your foresight will help them out a lot. Don’t be afraid to be different from your parents. They don’t expect you to be a clone of them.  , One of the best things you can do to be a good son and a good brother is to be kind to your siblings. It’s not always easy to get along with your siblings, whether they are older or younger, but you should try to develop relationships with them that are encouraging and non-competitive. This will not only help you be a good role model to your siblings, but it will help your parents out more than you know.   You can also be a good son by helping your siblings do their schoolwork, clean up, or learn basic skills. This will give your parents some more time to relax.  , As you grow older and develop your own personality and ideals, you may find that you and your parents fundamentally disagree about many things. Maybe your parents are devout Catholics while you struggle to believe in a higher power. Maybe your parents are conservative while you identify as a liberal. The important thing to keep in mind is not that you have to agree with everything your parents believe, but that you have to know how to respectfully disagree with them instead of starting a fight over every little difference you may have.   If your parents want you to do something you don’t want to do, such as go to church, try to explain why it’s not the path for you. Don’t just outright refuse, but make a point of staying calm while you explain your own beliefs. If your parents won’t budge, find a way to keep things civil and even friendly and to avoid topics that will cause you to fight.  , As you grow older, you should begin to see your parents as people who are more than just “Mom” and “Dad.” They have busy lives, friendships, relationships with their own parents, careers that they may or may not be happy with, and at least one child to take care of. Take some time to consider how busy and overwhelming life can be for your parents, and consider how certain difficult situations may make them feel before you start an argument or protest too much.   It takes character to be able to step into someone else’s shoes. The next time you have a fight with one of your parents, try to see the situation from his or her perspective to see if it gives you a better understanding of why they disagree with you. This can help strengthen your relationship and will give you a deeper understanding of who your parents really are. To see them as people, you can also ask them questions about their friends, their job, their childhood, or anything else that will shed some light on who they are.  , It’s okay to make mistakes as a son, and your parents won’t expect perfection from you. However, they will expect you to be accountable for your mistakes, and the best thing you can really do is to apologize when you’ve made a mistake. If you’ve done something wrong, no matter how big or small, it’s important to sit your parents down, look them in the eyes, and tell them that you’ve really messed up. It’s also important that you make a point of not repeating the mistake again.   Make sure that they know you really mean it, and that you’re not just saying it so they’ll stop being mad at you. If you’ve upset one of your siblings, it’s just as important to apologize to them as well.  , Once you move out of the home, whether you’re in college or living in another state for a new job, it’s important to stay in touch with your parents. Call them at least once or a few days a week, send them emails when you think of them, and make a point to visit home for holidays, long weekends, or just as often as you’re able. They’ll appreciate the time you’re giving them and will feel loved and cared for because of the effort you make to see them.   Remember anniversaries and birthdays. It’s important to send your parents birthday cards or gifts on their anniversaries or on Mother’s Day or Father’s Day (if your family celebrates it). This shows them that they’re on your mind even when you’re apart.  , Studies show that parents are the most happy when their own adult children are happy in their lives. This doesn’t mean you have to have a perfect life or that you should feel bad if things have taken a bad turn for you, but it does mean that you should work to live a meaningful and fulfilling life. If every time you talk to your parents, all you do is complain about your job, romantic life, or living situation, then they will begin to think that they have failed you by giving you a bad life. Talk to them about the good things in your life and sugar-coat the problems you’re facing, whenever you can, as long as you don’t feel like you’re being dishonest.With this in mind, know that it’s much more important to your parents that you’re happy than if you make a six figure salary, live in a posh neighborhood, or are dating the most beautiful woman in the city. It’s more important that you do the best you can with what you have, instead of striving for some impossible-to-reach version of happiness.  , You may feel like your parents will be disappointed if you ask for financial, or even for emotional support as an adult, but studies actually show that parents are happy to provide support to their children. They’ll like the fact that they can still be useful to you and you shouldn’t be ashamed to ask for help once in a while. This will keep your relationship strong and will allow you to grow up, too.Though it’s important to be independent from your parents as you become an adult and develop your own views about the world and follow your path, you can get some help from them once in a while.  , As you get older, you may have the temptation to tell your parents how to live their lives. While they may need your support as they get older, especially if they have trouble taking care of themselves, you should still try not to condescend to them or make them feel like they are helpless on their own. Give them the help they need without talking down to them or acting like they have no agency, and they will love you for it.   Avoid condescending to them, nagging them, or giving them a hard time for doing something their own way. Even if your way is quicker or more efficient, they may want to stick to their old routines, and you can’t hold that against them. Be patient with them. As they get older, it may take them longer to do things than it used to, but that doesn’t mean you should get frustrated.  , Another thing you can do to keep your relationship strong as you grow older is to treat your parents like they are fellow adults, instead of always thinking of them in the “Mom” or “Dad” role. This can help you discuss topics like finances or child rearing on an even playing field, and may lead you to get some great advice. Though it’s important not to condescend to your parents when you feel like you need to take care of them, seeing them as fellow adults can help add dynamic element to your relationship.If you see them as fellow adults, you’ll be able to be honest with them instead of just telling them what you think they want to hear from a model son. They’ll appreciate your candor.

These items can provide cushion from the cold, hard ground and offer some protection from insects.   Your local sporting goods store often has camping gear you can check out. Talk to a store employee about what your options are and which items have been rated highly before making a selection. You can also search online for retailers that sell sleeping gear. Websites often offer plenty of information on which camping gear is the best to get for your situation and which brands are worth the price.; , Sleeping bags are popular and can be very useful when you need to sleep on the ground. Make sure to purchase a sleeping bag rated for the temperature range you will be sleeping in. Bags meant for camping usually offer more room but are less efficient for retaining heat, so if you will be in a very cold location you should consider a sleeping bag meant for backpacking instead.   If you’re camping with another person, consider a sleeping bag that can fit 2 people for extra insulation and warmth. You can also use 2 sleeping bags for yourself or 2 people. Open your first sleeping bag and lay it flat. You can put a sheet over it if you want and then open the other sleeping bag to use as a blanket. A removable sleeping bag liner can help keep your sleeping bag cleaner if you will be using it for several nights. If it rains or snows, you will probably need to sleep in your sleeping bag inside a tent, vestibule or other makeshift cover for protection.  , A light, thin mat can ease back pain, lessen snoring and help you maintain a proper sleeping position flat on your back. Other positions, such as sleeping curled on your side can shorten your hip flexors, pectoral muscles and hamstrings, contributing to back pain., Foam is a durable and dense material that is nearly indestructible with a low weight and good insulation value. Foam pads are very useful if you will be sleeping on very cold, frozen or snowy ground as well as rough ground that could puncture other types of material. It is also an inexpensive option but can be bulky and may not provide enough cushion for some people.   You can get a compressed foam mattress covered with waterproof nylon that provides good insulation. The foam expands once the twist valve is opened. You can also blow into the valve to get the cushioning more to your liking. If you are backpacking, consider a 1"" to 2"" thick pad so that it is lighter to carry and takes up less room. A thicker pad for better comfort can also be purchased if you prefer. Fitted sheets might be available for some pads. If your back gets sore lying flat on the ground on something like thin foam, then use a jacket folded in half lengthwise and rolled into a cylinder underneath your pad for the small of your back.  , If you’re looking for extra lightweight material that takes up very little space, consider cutting your thin pad to torso length. To determine which parts of you touch the ground and will need insulation, lay down. Usually, this is just your back and heels, so cut down your pad to fit your back.   You can use a hat, a backpack or some other material under your legs and feet for insulation.  , These sleeping pads use air as the cushion and can be quite comfortable. They can also be very light (under 1 pound) but usually require that you blow them up to fill them. They do not offer very much insulation and those that do are often a little heavier.   You can usually get an air foot pump or electric pump to blow air into your mattress if you don’t want to spend the time and energy blowing it up yourself. Air mattresses tend to be bulky and can be heavy as well, depending on the brand you get.  , If you want to be up off the ground because the area is extra rocky or crawling with bugs, consider using a platform such as a cot or hammock. You can add a mat or pad to your cot to make it more comfortable and add insulation as well.   If you do decide to use a hammock, make sure you can find a spot that will accommodate it.  , Once you determine what environment and temperature range you will be sleeping in, gather up the blankets you will need. You will require thicker blankets for colder temperatures and lighter blankets for warm nights. If there will be a range of temperatures, then bring multiple blankets of various thickness to use as layers.   Camping on the beach can be uncomfortable with sand getting into everything. You can use flannel sheets instead of cotton here because the loose weave will allow sand to pass through the material. It can be helpful to bring an old comforter from your house to use as a blanket because it’s familiar so might help you fall asleep.  , Though sleeping flat without a pillow may be the most natural position for the spine, many people can’t sleep without some type of cushion under their head. Pillows, however, can add extra space and weight to your pack or may not be available. The good news is that many things can be used as a pillow if you improvise.   You can use spare clothing or an insulated jacket as a pillow. If you can’t spare any clothing, you can roll up a backpack and stick it underneath a blanket.  , An area that is level and cleared of rocks and sticks might be a good place to lay your mat. However, if you don’t have a pad and just have blankets or are without those too, finding a place beside a tree, wall or on a slab of rock would work better. These places can give you somewhere to prop your head up.   Trees provide shade and possibly even fruit, so they can be a good place to sleep. Always check the branches above you and make sure none are dead or dying so they won’t fall on you while you sleep. A pine tree is an ideal place to sleep under. The old needles and twigs that have fallen over the years can be soft and very insulating. While grassy areas can seem inviting, they can encourage condensation to form overnight. If you find a cave, it can be a good place to get out of the elements but always watch out for animals.  , Don’t wear bulky clothing before you slip into your bag. This can make the sleeping bag’s ability to trap body heat less effective. Long underwear and clean socks are warm and also prevent body oils from getting on your blankets and mats.   Sweaty or damp clothing always needs to be taken off as soon as possible. You can put extra clothing outside of your sleeping bag to add more insulation if needed. Wear a beanie or other type of hat. Your head and face can get very cold since heat escapes from exposed areas. Covering these areas will go a long way to keep you warm. You can also cinch your hood to keep heat in.  , If you don’t have any blankets or a sleeping bag, put leaves and twigs down where you will sleep. This will be softer than the ground and can slightly elevate you, keeping most bugs off of you. You can also use leaves, moss or pine needles to cover yourself, keep heat in and bugs out or as a pillow.   If you can, put a medium piece of cloth down over your bed before laying down on it. You can use a towel, sheet, sweatshirt or slip cover. You can use a washcloth, paper towels or clothes as a pillow between the rock, tree or ground that your head is laying on.  , Sweating can chill you so only use the amount of insulation you need to stay warm. If it’s a warm night, don’t zip up your sleeping bag and just tuck your feet into the bag, if needed. You can also just use a sheet or light blanket to cover yourself.   Use dry clothing and extra blankets to fill the spaces in your bag around your body so that there is less area for your body to heat. Use a water bottle full of warm water. Put it next to your body, preferably your torso. This can help generate more heat.  , When you choose an area, check for signs of ants and other pests before making your bed. Always shake out your bag and blankets before you go to sleep to make sure there aren’t any insects, scorpions, spiders or snakes hiding in there. If you can, elevate yourself above the ground on something to avoid being near where insects usually crawl.  , If you will be sleeping outside for a while, then you will want to keep your clothes and bedding clean and dry. You can rinse material in a river and leave it to dry on a branch. Every morning, allow your blankets and clothes to air out so that any moisture that collects overnight can dry out.  , Know that you will not be sleeping in your comfortable bed. Recognize that your situation is probably going to cause some inconveniences for you and will not be what you are used to. Be ok with it, though, and enjoy your new experience while it lasts.   Take this opportunity to look at the twinkling stars, smell the clean air and listen to the sounds of the wilderness.  , Temperatures can drop quickly after sunset and things can get very dark. Be prepared by keeping layers of clothing and other forms of insulation as well as flashlights or a headlamp in your car and on your person if you are hiking or camping. For safety, a whistle, knife or other tool can also be useful.   Be prepared for nighttime bathroom breaks. Put a flashlight or headlamp near you, along with your shoes.  , Secure all your food and anything scented outside your tent, if you have one, or away from your sleeping location. If you spill some of your food, collect it and put it in approved bins. Do not spit out toothpaste near where you will sleep either. If your clothes have collected the scent of food or food residue, do not wear them to sleep.  , Even though you will be sleeping on the ground, you can help your mind and body get ready for bed by doing the same things you would normally do before bed. If you usually brush your teeth before you get into bed, then do that before you lay down in your makeshift bed. It can give you a feeling of normalcy.  , A meal or snack before bed can help you go to sleep. If it’s a cold night, digesting the food can warm you up. Your body will then generate more heat to keep you warmer.   Eat foods that contain the sleep hormone melatonin, such as tart cherries or walnuts., Some light exercise can help make you tired. Stretching can be relaxing or you can do some sit-ups or pushups. Don’t exercise too intensely, though, or you could become more awake. You also don’t want to get sweaty.  , Always make sure you have adequate water access. Being thirsty is not conducive to sleep. You don’t want to drink so much that you have to pee all night, but you do want to be hydrated. This will aid blood circulation and help get rid of the possibility of headaches, like those that can happen at high altitudes.   A warm beverage can be soothing and help you keep warm. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages, though, if it is cold. They can actually increase heat loss because consuming alcohol tends to dilate blood vessels under the skin.  , Read or take deep breaths to calm your body and mind down. If the night sounds spook you, then try not to listen too much to them. Most animals are not dangerous and are probably more scared of people than you are of them.   Try sleeping near a river (keep a safe distance). The sound of rushing water can serve as white noise that drowns out unnerving night sounds. Eventually, you will be tired enough to fall asleep. It can be rough at first but if you are sleeping on the ground for more than a night or 2, it will start to get very easy.

Often, this is done through connecting with your body because your body uses sensations to connect to the present moment. Have a daily meditation practice or make your daily activities a meditation by practicing mindfulness through observing your breath, especially when you’re experiencing intense emotions. Tune into your everyday sensations such as feeling the water hitting your skin as you shower, observing the way your muscles and bones shift as you walk or climb stairs, or tuning into what noises you hear around you. Allow thoughts and feelings to pass through your mind without judging them or reacting to them.This can help you stay detached from negative experiences.   Practicing mindfulness can help increase positive emotions, increase gray matter in the brain, and boost compassion toward others and yourself.Drop in on a meditation class or find a phone application to help you practice mindfulness meditation.; , Imagine your life in the future when you are at your best. Consider all aspects of your life: health, hobbies/activities, career, friends, and family. Don’t get caught up in how your life does not reflect these now and focus solely on the future. Get creative and continue writing for 15 minutes, diving into the depths of what you will be doing, what things you will enjoy, and who you will spend time with. People who do this exercise report feeling more positive even one month after completing it.Imagining your best possible self can help you figure out your goals, dreams, and desires. It can help you identify your dreams and create steps to get you there. Think about what your best possible self looks like. What job do you have? Where do you live? Do you have pets? What kinds of things do you do for fun? Who are your friends and what do you like about them?  , If you need a boost at home, in the car, or at work, keep some positive affirmations around to maintain an optimistic approach. You can also practice saying positive affirmations before your workday, events, or other situations where you may need a boost of positivity. Get in the habit of saying a meaningful affirmation when you wake up, when you’re on your way to work, or before you attempt something challenging. This can help train you to approach situations more positively. The benefits of affirmations can last months and years.For example, when you wake up, say to yourself, “I am capable and able to approach the day with kindness and love,” “I can be successful at work today and every day,” or ""I can be happy about some things today.""  , Keeping your body healthy can keep your brain healthy. Getting good rest can help your brain perform more optimally and boost your happiness. Not getting enough sleep affects your mind and can impact your stress levels. Low sleep can affect your physical and mental functioning, so make sure you’re getting restful sleep each night. If you have problems sleeping, try waking up and going to bed at the same time each day, even on the weekends. Create a relaxing sleep environment and do calming activities before bed such as reading, taking a bath, or sipping tea.Keep your bedroom relaxing. If excessive light disturbs you, buy darker curtains. Make your bedroom a place that looks and feels relaxing to you by decorating it in soft, not bright, tones.  , Eating wholesome, nourishing meals can help you stay energized and feeling good throughout the day instead of in a “brain fog.”Make sure to include whole grains, proteins, and fats in your diet. If you don’t know how to balance your meals or get proper nutrients, work with a nutritionist or use a food diary to keep track of your nutrients. You can download some free phone applications to help you track your calories, sugars, and major food groups each day.   Cut down on sugar, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, and other substances as a way to keep your head clear and your emotions in balance.  , Your mind determines whether you remember an event as positive or negative. Creating more positive enforcement of memories can help you form positive emotions and memories.When you focus on negative thoughts during an experience, you’re more likely to look back on the experience as negative. If you notice yourself creating a negative experience, think about what is going right.   Reframe events you experience and remember them more positively.This can help you retrain your brain to approach things more positively and remember them in a positive way. Most experiences can be perceived as either positive or negative, depending on your focus and mindset. For example, if you feel like you’ve had a bad day, think of the small things that went well or felt good throughout the day. Perhaps you can offset the difficulties of running late or forgetting your lunch in the morning with a more positive and fun afternoon by doing tasks you enjoy, buying a special treat, or talking to someone you care about.  , Instead of focusing on all of the things that could go wrong, find the things that are going right. Focus on possibilities and opportunities for optimism and not pessimism. If it feels like everything is going wrong, notice even the smallest thing that is going well. If you’re feeling frustrated, stop and take a moment to shift your attention to something more positive. For example, if you’re running late to a meeting, you might feel overwhelmed or frustrated. Stop and think, “I’m upset that I will be late, but I know I will make it on time. I’ve prepared for this meeting so I expect that it will go well.” Having a tangible motivation can help create a bright side. For example, plan a vacation if you are feeling stressed or overworked. You can look forward to your vacation when you start feeling overwhelmed and remind yourself that enjoyment is in your future.  , Gratitude is a way to give thanks for what you have. Instead of focusing on what you lack, focus on what you have or what you appreciate. People who consistently practice gratitude tend to have higher levels of optimism and happiness, act with generosity and compassion, and experience more positive emotions.Get in the habit of finding things every day that you are grateful for.   You can write in a gratitude journal or notice things throughout your day that you can be thankful for. Try waking up and going to bed each day by naming three things that you are grateful for.  , Feeling optimistic is easy when life is going well and all of your needs are met. It gets much harder when you’re feeling low, things go wrong, and you’re struggling. Optimism isn’t about feeling happy all the time or thinking that everything will turn out fine. It has more to do with continuing positive momentum even when life gets difficult.If you engage in optimism practices, keep them up even when you’re feeling low or in a bad mood.  , When you notice yourself thinking negatively, ask yourself whether the thought is helpful or not. If it’s not a helpful thought, notice it and stop it, even if you cut yourself off in mid-thought. Notice your negative thoughts and stop them in their tracks.If you catch yourself thinking negatively about your abilities or approaching a day as a “bad day,” think about how you turn that negativity around for something more positive. For example, if you dread a family function and think, “I can’t believe how much time I’m going to waste and I wish I was doing something else,” catch yourself in your negative thoughts and replace that thought with, “This may not be what I want to be doing, but I can be friendly and helpful to my family.”  , Unhappy people tend to compare themselves to others while happy people don’t engage in any comparisons with others, whether favorable or unfavorable.If you catch yourself saying, “I wish I was more like her” or, “If only I had his job,” it’s time to stop these comparisons. Whether the comparisons are positive or negative, they are not improving your life.   When you catch yourself in a comparison, focus on something more positive. For example, instead of thinking, “I wish I had a house more like theirs” think to yourself, “I know I can have a house like this if I continue to work hard and save money.”  , If you tend to think that things bring you happiness (“If only I could get that new game/dress/house/pair of shoes, etc…”), your happiness is threatened if your material circumstances change. Perhaps you’re a perfectionist or you’re always on the lookout for better options, even if you have something good in front of you. Your expectations may far exceed your ability to attain what you want and can make you feel incompetent or unsuccessful. These kinds of thought and behavior patterns may make you feel pessimistic about your abilities, not optimistic.For example, if you really want a new cell phone and think that you’ll finally be happy if you get it, think again. You will likely get used to having the phone and the novelty will wear off quickly, leaving you wanting something else. If you find yourself engaging in negative thought patterns, bring some awareness to your thoughts by saying to yourself, “These thoughts do not help me engage in positive or optimistic patterns and do not add to my life.”  ",1589,"['bright side', 'negative thought patterns', 'practice gratitude', 'others', 'negative thoughts', 'optimism', 'healthy diet', 'possible self', 'practice mindful meditation', 'life', 'positive affirmations', 'night', 'happy memories']"

No two people are the same and each of us as individuals bring our own collective positives and negatives to the world. Though you may be intimidated by these girls, remember that they too have flaws just like you. You can never be just like them just like they can never be like you.   Think about all of the positive attributes you have that they don’t. Perhaps you can play piano well or volleyball, or maybe you are a very nice person. Focus on your own strengths. You might even try writing down your strengths and posting them somewhere that you will see them daily, such as on your bathroom mirror or closet door. You can invite trusted friends and family members to contribute to your list if you are having trouble coming up with a list of your strengths.; , Though we all have a desire to fit in with others, never pretend to be different or more like others just to be accepted. Most people can sense fakeness from a mile away and no one respects a person who is not genuine. Allow your own authenticity to shine through and even if people do not respond positively to it. At least you will know that you are being true to yourself.For instance, if you notice everyone is wearing a certain brand of shoe, but you don’t like that shoe, don’t buy it just to fit in. Wear the clothes that you love and you’ll feel happier and more like yourself. It is also important to avoid changing your personality or behavior to fit in with others. Do things that are within your moral compass and be yourself.  , These girls have their own insecurities that they likely deal with on a daily basis as well. They may be just as nervous as you around others even if they play it cool. Sometimes, we interpret others as being intimidating when they are actually just shy. Consider that possibility as well as others and move forward without making assumptions about their personality.Consider that they also may find you intimidating. This will help you feel more comfortable when you are around them if you feel that the two of you have similar feelings and are equals. Keep in mind that social media can make anyone seem confident, even if they are not.  , Often times, the fears that you have are not as bad as you think. In interacting with these girls, consider the worst possible thing that could happen. Perhaps they might ignore you should you speak to them or maybe you fear that they will insult you. Those these situations are certainly not ideal, they are also not the end of the world. If you feel prepared for the worst, then you can be ready in the event that it does happen. You can also feel less fearful because even the worst case scenario is probably not that bad in reality.Try to have some ideas about how you will handle a situation if it does not work out, but also avoid anticipating the worst. Try to think positive and imagine that the situation will go well. Expecting the worst to happen may lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Even if they insult you, you can just walk away from the situation. They’re not worth your time.  , In interacting with these intimidating girls, you might also find that some positivity can come from it. Consider all of the wonderful things that could happen should you surround yourself with them. Perhaps you will make a new friend or you will discover that they are more like you than you thought.Remember that they may be shy and are perhaps just waiting for you to talk to them first.  , Entering into a situation where you feel intimidated can be very stressful, but you can combat this stress. Before you see or have to interact with them, take a few deep breaths. Sometimes, when there is tension, we often forget to breathe normally. Take a moment to breathe and to reassure yourself to be calm.   Breathe in deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Do this a few times until you feel calm. You can also do a quick scan of your body to locate any areas of tension. This will send a message to your brain that everything is okay.  , In order to feel less intimidated by these girls and by anyone else in the future, it’s important to begin building your confidence. One way to do this is to identify your strengths. Perhaps you have been so caught up in thinking about the girls who intimidate you that you have forgotten about how wonderful you are. Take some time to reflect on the positives of you.Think deeply when compiling this list. Think about all of the nice things you have done for others later or the ways that you are special. Some examples of positive qualities are intelligence, beauty, kindness, humor, empathy, and ambition, but there are many more. You can enlist the help of friends and family members to help you make a complete list. They might point out strengths that you had not considered. Post the list where you will see it daily.  , In addition to all of the wonderful things that you are, consider all of the wonderful things that you have done. You can use the list of your strengths in thinking of your achievements. If you indicated that you are intelligent, then make a note if you make good grades as well. Think back on times that you have received awards, or praise from your parents or others.Remember that achievements are beyond your grades. Accomplishments are not just in the things that you can produce, but also in how you impact people. Maybe you are a very good babysitter or help take care of your siblings. That is important and should be noted. Your effort and hard work are also things that you should add to this list. For example, even if you did not win first place in a track meet, all the training time that you put in to prepare yourself for the race is an accomplishment.  , People tend to feel great when they are wearing their favorite outfit, and feeling great can help you exude confidence. Take some time each day to select an outfit that looks nice on you, flatters your body shape, and is comfortable.Pick your outfit out the night before school so you don’t have to rush in the mornings. Select clothes that are ironed and clean. Accessorize with something unique like a cool pair of earrings or funky shoes.  , The better you feel, the more confident you will tend to be. Take care of yourself by exercising regularly and eating healthy foods. Perhaps you are intimidated by these girls because they are more physically fit than you or they outperform you in sports or gym class. This is a great way to improve yourself, get active, and boost your confidence.Don’t overdo it with exercise, however. If you are not very physically active, start small by exercising 2-3 times per week. Don’t exercise to look like these other girls. Do it for yourself to look and feel better!  , Often times, we deal with insecurities that trouble us very much in our daily lives. These insecurities are likely why you feel uncomfortable around these girls. However, it is also important to consider which of your insecurities are rooted in real internal flaws and which are more a figment of your imagination. Often times, your negative thoughts about yourself can be illogical.For instance, if you sometimes think of yourself as being unattractive, think of all the times that others have told you that you are pretty. Also recognize that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and we all have traits that are beautiful and unique to us. If you find yourself dwelling on an insecurity that you can’t seem to overcome, then you may want to see a therapist for help.  , Take some time to identify people in your life who you look up to or who have qualities that you admire. If it is possible, seek to spend more time with these people. There is a proverb that states that you are the compilation of the five people that you spend the most time around. If you spend time around people who you want to be more like, then you will eventually become more like them.Try to spend less time around people who are negative or who make you feel badly about yourself. This is a confidence killer.  , Remember that feeling intimidated is often less about those girls than it is about you. They are not taking your power away from you, but you are giving it away to them. Once you recognize that, you can begin to reclaim that power. You are much more powerful than you realize and give yourself credit for. Don’t give up your power for anyone., No one can make you feel inferior without you allowing them to in some ways. Though you cannot perhaps prevent mean things that people do or mean looks that people give, you can help how you feel about it. Refuse to let their intimidation alter how you feel about yourself. Life is too short and too wonderful to allow people you aren’t close to make you feel bad longterm.You can try repeating positive mantras in your head like “I will not let them hurt me. I am powerful and wonderful and no one can make me feel otherwise.”  , A huge part of self-value is entrenched in taking proper care of yourself. In addition to exercise and eating well, there are other practices that you can employ to care for yourself beyond just the physical. Take some time every day to do things that make you happy and enrich your spirit.   Take a nice hot bubble bath after a long day. Read a new book or an old one that you enjoy. Watch a movie. Have an at home spa day. Do your nails and hair and put on a face mask. Indulge in a favorite hobby, or start a new hobby and spend some time learning it. Advocate for causes that you are passionate about, such as education, the environment, or animals.  , The friends you spend time with will make a huge impression on your life. If you find yourself in situations where you must be with people who intimidate you, try to add your own friends into the fold as well so that you don’t have to be alone. Though you can’t be with your friends all the time, you can still find moments to spend with them throughout your day, especially if you have class or lunch together.   You may also want to evaluate whether certain friendships are healthy or not. If they are unhealthy, then you may need to let them go.  , Self-value is also largely about recognizing the things that make you ‘you’. You are the only you on the planet and you are important and the world would be a different place entirely without you. Take some time to think about all of the things you add to the world. Think about how much your parents, other relatives, and friends love and value you. You have made their world all the better simply by existing!, Make a list of the people you love and those who love you as well. Though you are young, look at all the people you have impacted already! Keeping this list can help remind you of how important you are.  , Never forget that you deserve to be there just as much as those girls that intimidate you. Whether you are in a class with them, on a sports team, or in an organization, those things are just as much yours as they are theirs. Remember that and take up the place that is rightfully yours.   Don’t take a seat at the back of the class or move off of the sidewalk to make room for a group. Sit where you would like to sit and walk where you would like to walk without being rude.  , Perhaps these girls are some of the most intimidating people that you have ever encountered and you feel fearful to approach or talk to them. Think on others who intimidate you in life, but slightly less. Talking to these people first can build up your courage and make it easier for you to talk to the girls who are intimidating you.For instance, perhaps you feel intimidated by the lunch lady or by your older sister, but not to the point that you feel afraid or overly nervous around them. Talk to them more during the day than you normally would. You’ll feel all the stronger for it.  , It can be scary to approach girls who intimidate you and strike up a conversation with them. However, you can start speaking to them in small ways to break the ice and get rid of the allusion that you have of them as being untouchable or scary. Be sure to smile and make eye contact to indicate warmth.   Ask one of them to pass you a ball in gym class or a cup in the cafeteria. Make a remark to them that doesn’t require a response like “the weather is so nice today.”  , One other way to make them less intimidating to you is to imagine them in ridiculous or funny situations. For instance, perhaps when you go to approach them to speak you could imagine them wearing a bunny costume or having googly eyes or anything that will make you feel less nervous about them.Be sure not to laugh out loud when you are talking to them unless one of you says something funny.  , Remember that they are not your parent, boss, or teacher and you are not required under any circumstances to say yes to them. Use the power within you to say ‘no’ if you don’t want to do something., Show these girls the kindness that you are hoping that they will show to you. Greet them with a “hello” and a smile when you see them during the day. Don’t say rude things about them behind their backs. Make sure you put into the situation what you are hoping to get out it.",2426,"['deep breaths', 'list', 'individuality', 'strengths', 'kindness', 'practice self-care', 'care', 'positive role models', 'special qualities', 'others', 'power', 'way', 'someone', 'people permission', 'case scenario', 'people', 'girls', 'body', 'space', 'insecurities', 'achievements', 'things', 'positive friends', 'silly situations']"

Perhaps you want puppies, or maybe your pit bull is a purebred. Breeding a dog can be expensive. You will have to take good care of your pregnant female, pay for multiple vet visits, and supervise the puppies during their first weeks of life. Make sure that you are dedicated to the idea before you begin.   Pit bulls are one of the most commonly surrendered dogs. In some areas, they can compose up to 40% of the homeless dog population, and many of these dogs are euthanized in shelters. Adopting a pit bull can not only be a cost effective option for many people but it can also save a life.; , Some areas have breed-specific laws that outlaw the ownership or breeding of pit bulls. Even if pit bulls are allowed in your town, you may be required to muzzle them while out. Look up your local laws, and make sure that you comply with them., There are several different breeds of dogs collectively known as pit bulls. If you want a particular breed of pit bull, you should make sure that both parents are of that breed. If you do not do this, you may have a mixed litter. The most common breeds of pit bulls include:   American Pit Bull Terriers American Staffordshire Terriers Staffordshire Bull Terriers You may want to check that the parents are registered with the American Kennel Club. This will ensure that the parents are purebred and that they really belong to their breed. It will also increase the value of the puppies if you are planning on selling them.  , Even if your dog has no outward problems, recessive genetic disorders can arise during breeding. You should have both the female and male dogs genetically tested to look for any potential diseases that could arise. While pit bulls are not known to have many problems, they can face the following issues:   Hip Dysplasia Elbow Dysplasia Autoimmune Thyroiditis NCL-A (Cerebellar Ataxia) Eye problems Heart problems, Before you begin the mating process, you should find homes for the puppies first. Realize that you might have a litter of seven to ten puppies, and each will need a home. If you start looking for homes early, you can find a replacement home should a potential adopter back out.You can advertise online, through a local kennel club, or through your vet.  , If you do not have a male pit bull, you can hire a stud from another breeder. You will have to pay stud fees and negotiate a contract with the owner beforehand. The stud can physically mate with your female dog, or he can be used for artificial insemination.   Local kennel clubs can put you in touch with reputable breeders. Always make sure that you are hiring from a reputable, responsible breeder. Ask to see the dog, and verify its temperament first. Make sure it has no aggression or behavioral problems. If you are looking to breed purebred puppies, be sure to ask for proof of the stud’s pedigree up front. Always make sure to have a written contract between you and the breeder beforehand. The owner of the stud may request that your dog is tested for disease first., Before you try to mate the dogs, you should have the dogs examined by a vet. Talk to your vet about your plans to breed the pit bulls. The vet will be able to examine the dog for common problems and let you know if the dogs are ready to mate.   If you are hiring a stud, you should ask the stud’s owner to take the stud to a vet. Ask for documentation showing the stud’s health, including any potential health or behavioral problems that could pass onto the puppies. The vet can also provide personalized advice on your dog’s diet, health, and exercise over the course of the pregnancy.  , Female pit bulls tend to go into heat twice a year, and each one will last about three weeks.During this, you will notice that her vulva is swelling and discharging liquid. Your pit bull cannot mate until about two weeks into this cycle. At this point, you may notice that:   Her discharge is turning from a bloody red to clear or brownish. She is beginning to show interest in mating. She is releasing a smell that will attract male dogs Her tail moves to the side to make room for a male dog., Leave the female and male pit bulls together. You may notice the male mounting the female. The male will begin to thrust, and then remain attached to the female for between ten and thirty minutes. Do not attempt to separate the dogs at this point. This is a natural part of the mating process.If you have hired a stud, you may find it to be easier to take the female to the male. This is because the male may be less likely to mate in an unfamiliar environment than a female in heat.  , If you are having difficulty mating pit bulls, you may want to check the progesterone levels of the female. Progesterone is a hormone that is released when the pit bull is ready to mate. This test can help you find the proper timing for breeding or it can diagnose a problem that might interfere with breeding. Ask your vet if you can have your dog tested., Dogs can be artificially inseminated too. You can use a stud that you have personally chosen, or you can use semen from a sperm bank that has been frozen. Ask your vet if they offer reproductive services for dogs or if they can refer you to someone who can provide you this service.If you are using frozen semen, you may want to check that it has been DNA certified by a kennel club. Artificial insemination can cost hundreds of dollars. Freezing and storing semen may incur additional costs., You may notice a growing appetite, larger nipples, or an increase in weight in your pit bull. These are not surefire signs of pregnancy, however. The only way to be absolutely certain that a dog is pregnant is to have her checked out by a vet. Typically, a blood test or ultrasound will be performed. This test can typically be done between 28 and 32 days after the dog has mated.A false pregnancy is one in which the pit bull displays the typical pregnancy behaviors but is not pregnant. If you suspect your pit bull is pregnant, take her to a vet and have her tested. A false pregnancy may be the sign of another problem.  , You do not necessarily have to feed your dog significantly more during pregnancy. Instead, make sure that she is receiving a well-rounded diet with adequate amounts of calcium and phosphorus.   In the last few weeks of pregnancy, gradually increase your pit bull’s food by 15 to 20%.You can feed your dog a store-bought dog food. Read the nutritional information, and make sure that it is at least 29% protein and 17% fat. Check that her food contains calcium and phosphorus to promote lactation. It should have between 1-1.8% calcium and .8-1.6% phosphorus., A whelping box is a special bed that your dog will give birth in. You can buy a whelping box from a pet store or online. You can also build your own. Place the box in a warm, dry area, where the dog can rest quietly after giving birth.   You should line this box with newspaper when your dog is preparing to give birth. These can be changed easily when soiled. After birth, you can replace it with bath mats or blankets.Once the whelping box is ready, you should lead your dog to the box. Do this early in the pregnancy so that your dog grows comfortable and used to it. This will allow the dog to naturally select the whelping box when giving birth.  , There are a few different ways to estimate the dog’s litter size during pregnancy. While none of these are completely accurate, they can help you prepare for the number of puppies you may have at the end of your dog’s pregnancy. Ask your vet about:    Abdominal Palpitation: beginning at around day 28 of the pregnancy, your vet may start to feel your pit bull’s stomach to see how many sacs are in her uterus. This is easier earlier in the pregnancy than later.  Radiography: your vet will use X-rays to count how many fetal skeletons are in your dog’s uterus. This is the most effective way of determining litter size. It can be done around day 45 of the pregnancy.  Ultrasound: your vet will use sound waves to determine if your pit bull is pregnant, although it may not be able to accurately determine the litter size. It can be done around day 30., A few days before your pit bull is ready to give birth, she will start to build a nest in her whelping box. Start taking the dog’s temperature. You may notice a drop to below 100 °F (38 °C). Within twenty-four hours of this change, the dog’s cervix may dilate. This means she is ready to give birth.   In most cases, your pit bull will need no assistance in giving birth. That said, you should supervise the birth closely in case a problem arises.  , When the puppies are born, they will be inside membrane sacs. Your pit bull should begin licking them. This will help the puppies breathe while removing their sacs. You should try to make sure that there is one sac and placenta for every puppy. If there isn’t, there may be a placenta stuck in your dog. Call your vet if this happens.If your pit bull does not remove the sack, you should open it yourself. With your fingers, gently break the membrane near the puppy’s head, and peel it backwards. Remove any fluids from around the puppy’s mouth and nose. You can rub the puppy with a towel to help it breathe.  , You should be alert for any problems that might arise during your dog’s delivery. Have the vet’s number handy just in case something goes wrong. You may even want to have an emergency number in case the puppies are born during off hours. Call your vet if:   Thirty minutes of contractions happen without a puppy appearing The dog does not go into labor within twenty-four hours of her temperature dropping The dog has been pregnant more than seventy days The dog appears to be in extreme pain Hours pass without the dog giving birth to all of her puppies  , During the first day or two, the mother may not want to eat much. That said, her appetite will return. By three weeks, the mother may be eating up to four times her normal diet. It is important that the mother eats frequently. Break up her food into four meals throughout the day., Between six and eight weeks, the puppies will need their first round of shots. You may decide to get them their shots before sending them to their new homes. Be sure to remind the new owners that the puppies will require more shots at ten weeks. Shots needed at six weeks vaccinate against:   Distemper Measles Parainfluenza Bordetella, The puppies will be ready to wean from their mother’s milk at around three or four weeks of age. Mix a puppy milk replacer with an equal amount of water. With your finger, wet their mouth with this mix. After a few days, you can crumble puppy food into this mixture. Your puppies should be eating solid food only by six weeks old., It is important to socialize pit bull puppies while they are young. This can prevent aggression later in life. Whether it is deserved or not, pit bulls do have a reputation of being an aggressive breed, but that does not mean that your puppies will turn out that way. You can prevent aggressive behavior through training and handling.Hold, play, and interact with the puppies often. Separate puppies if they are fighting, mounting, or biting. Introduce the puppies to strangers often., Once the puppies are weaned, they will be ready to go to their new homes. This will typically be around eight weeks of age. Contact the new owners, and make sure that each puppy has a home to go to.   Do not abandon un-adopted puppies at a shelter. Shelters are already overwhelmed with pit bulls, and your puppy may be euthanized.

Although some schools have “pre-law” majors or concentrations, law schools do not require any particular major. Find a subject that interests you and in which you can do well.  Make sure you attend an accredited undergraduate college or university. To check, visit the U.S. Department of Education’s (“DOE”) Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs.; , The ability to speak with anyone is a great skill for a lawyer, including real estate lawyers. Real estate lawyers meet with a variety of people during their workday, from clients, potential clients, opposing counsel, and even judges or arbitrators. You need to be comfortable speaking to diverse constituencies, often off the top of your head.   While in college, look for opportunities to engage in public speaking. These opportunities can be in debate clubs, public speaking competitions, or even acting as a tour guide for the school. Also look for opportunities to strengthen your research and writing skills. Sign up for upper-level electives that allow you to write long research papers.  , Law school admissions is basically a numbers game, and the two most important numbers are your undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and your score on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). To make the strongest admissions case possible, you should try to get the highest grades possible. Admissions committees view a high GPA as an indication that you are motivated and work hard.To get into an accredited law school, you will need a GPA around 3.0 or higher. Applicants admitted into the Top 50 schools generally have a GPA of at least a 3.5.  , Another key element of your application will be letters of recommendations from professors who know you. To get strong letters of recommendation, you should try to work with faculty as a research or teaching assistant. This experience will allow professor to write detailed letters of recommendation in support of your admission to law school.  , You can get an early taste of the life of a real estate lawyer while in college. Intern or work part-time for a real estate lawyer. Many lawyers and law firms need clerical and support staff assistance in the summer but also throughout the year.   It’s never too early to begin building your network. If you do a good job working for a real estate attorney in college, then when you graduate law school you can revive the relationship and potentially get a job.  , The LSAT is offered four times a year, in June, September, December, and February. It is offered on Saturdays. There are special sessions for those who observe a Saturday Sabbath.Create a free account at the Law School Admission Counsel’s (“LSAC”) website. Find a test date and location. To do this, start on LSAC’s Law School Admission Counsel’s website Dates and Deadlines page. The last date to take the exam for fall admissions is typically September/October. You may be able to take the December or February test, but by then many law schools will already have filled most of their classes.  , The LSAT is probably the most important factor in your law school application, so take it seriously. It tests reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning.Test prep companies offer tutoring, but you can also study on your own.   Your local library or bookstore should have copies of old LSAT exams. Find the most recent to take as practice exams. The LSAT is scored on a scale from 120-180, with 180 being the highest. To get into an accredited law school, try to get a score around the fiftieth percentile, which is around a 152., The LSAT comprises five multiple choice sections and one unscored essay. Four of the five multiple choice sections count toward your score. The fifth is experimental and does not count toward your score. You will not know in advance which section is experimental.  Read up ahead of time on the test rules so that you can follow them to the letter. Failure to follow the rules could disqualify you from taking the test. A complete set of test day rules can be found on the LSAC’s website on its Day of the test webpage.  , You can take the LSAT more than once. Schools may choose to accept your higher score, or they may choose to average the two. You have to pay each time you take the test.   On average, test takers are able to increase their score only two to three points on a re-take.You may not want to retake the test unless your score was far below what you were scoring on practice exams.  , All law schools use CAS. You will send them your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and evaluation. CAS then creates a packet that it sends to each law school you apply to. The service requires a fee.Make sure to get all documents to CAS in a timely manner. A law school will not move on your application until it has your packet from CAS.  , Ask early. Sometimes professor agree but then forget as they get busy. Only ask professors who you are sure can write a positive letter of recommendation and do not press if faculty are hesitant. A hesitant professor might write a weak letter of recommendation.   Also think of getting letters from employers. If you worked part-time for a real estate attorney, then a detailed letter from your employer could help your application as well. Some recommenders may need to be prompted to complete the letter. Send a friendly email reminder, or stop in to chat.  , Law schools require that you write a short (about 500 word) statement, on a topic of your own choosing.You want your personal statement to be engaging, free of errors, and brief.   Follow the directions. If the school wants you to write on a specific topic, write on that topic. Also, if they give you a word limit, stick to the limit. Going over, by even a few words, can harm your chances of admission. Feel free to write about your interest in real estate law. However, it’s a good idea to only write on the subject if you have something meaningful to say. The best personal statements are often based on anecdotes, so write about real estate law if you have some experience with it.  , An addendum can help explain something that looks bad in your application. It provides context for any information that might raise “red flags” in the eyes of the Admissions Committee members.Red flags include criminal convictions, punishment for cheating or plagiarism, or semesters with very low grades. An addendum might also clarify why one LSAT score is much higher than another. Remember to explain in your addendum, not make excuses. Your addendum does not need to be lengthy. For example, you could simply state, “I would like to explain why my first LSAT score is 20 points lower than my second. Two days before the first exam, I contracted the flu. Since I was afraid that cancelling would result in my not being able to apply to law school this year, I went ahead and took the exam although I was sick. During the second exam, I felt much better and scored closer to my averages on practice exams.”  , You can gauge your likelihood of gaining admission to specific schools by using the LSAC calculator. Enter your undergraduate GPA and LSAT score to see your chances at any ABA-accredited law school.   If you have a 3.5 GPA and a 155 LSAT, then you have an 80% chance of getting into Brooklyn Law School but only a 50% chance of getting into Pittsburgh Law School.  , Unless you attend a top 20 school, you most likely will be practicing in the area where you attended law school. Most law schools place their alumni in the local legal community. Accordingly, you should pay attention to the school’s location and make sure you feel comfortable living there.   You should always ask any prospective law school for its job placement statistics. Pay attention to the number of students who get “full-time jobs requiring a JD” after graduation. This is the most relevant statistic. Other statistics, such as “those working full-time,” might include people who are working full-time in a job that doesn’t require a law degree.  , As you compare law schools, you should always pay attention to costs. Law school tuition now exceeds $40,000 a year at many private law schools.Factoring in living expenses, you could be borrowing close to $200,000 to complete a three-year degree.   Tuition for out-of-state law students is often comparable to the tuition of a private school. If you want to move to a state and hope to qualify as an in-state resident, contact the law school’s admissions office for information.  , A great way to get hands-on legal experience while in law school is to participate in a clinic. Many law schools have clinics where students represent low-income clients while under the supervision of a faculty member. Some law schools offer real estate clinics or have real estate institutes. These schools include Brooklyn Law School and John Marshall Law School.In a real estate clinic, students may represent low-income cooperative boards or other non-profits. Students will assist with loan and co-op unit closings, shareholder meetings, and drafting by-law or lease amendments., The basic curriculum for first year students is pretty much the same at any law school, but after the first year, the classes available might be very different. Many law schools offer a real estate focus or certificate. These schools will offer many upper-level electives in areas such as Land Use Regulation, Basic and Advanced Real Estate, Construction Law, and Municipal Law., Applying to more than one school increases your chances of being accepted. If you don’t get into any school, then you will have to wait a year before applying. , Unless you attend an accelerated or part-time program, law school will take three years. In your first year, you will take foundation courses in torts, contracts, property, civil procedure, criminal law, and constitutional law.  You may end up taking 1L classes with the same people. Get to know your “section” because these people may be the source of career opportunities and contacts down the road.  , Law school can be very isolating, as all students are striving to do the best that they can to master complex, difficult material. You will spend a lot of time alone in the library. Be sure to periodically put the books away and try to meet other people. Join a sports league or a student organization just to unwind.   Another good way to meet people is to join a study group. In addition to the comradery, you will also get help with exam preparation, share notes and outlines, and have a group of people to talk through difficult legal issues with. If you join a study group, however, stick with it. No one likes people who join a group only to drop out after a month.  , Your grades will follow you around your entire career. Though the importance of grades decreases over time, poor grades could keep you locked out of jobs, at least initially.If you want to practice real estate law at a large firm, then doing well in your 1L classes is critical. Large firms will hire summer associates on the basis of your 1L grades. If you want to work at a large firm or in-house at a large corporation, then you should plan on getting grades at the top of your class. To get an idea of how well you need to do to be competitive with large employers, visit your career services office and ask what large firms or corporations come onto your campus to interview. Career Services should also have information on the GPA required to be hired by these large firms.  , Some law schools help place students with a real estate attorney, either at a title insurance company or at a law firm. Students will help out with a variety of tasks, such as title, closing, contract, and other problems.Externships can be taken for credit. If your school does not allow externships for working with a real estate attorney, then you could think about working part-time after your 1L year.  , During the summers you can work for attorneys as a clerk or a summer associate. You should begin looking for these opportunities in the spring semester. Larger firms will advertise through your school’s Career Services. However, you can also send out a copy of your resume and transcript and ask if a position is available.   Although you may be paid, money should not be the primary purpose of a summer job. Instead, you should begin building your reputation. Be sure to do your best work. If you do good work, then your employer may remember you later when you are looking for a job. Be sure to hang onto contact information, such as phone numbers or emails, and send an occasional email to check up or just say “hi.” Be sure to get writing experience in your summer jobs. Employers usually ask for a writing sample when you apply for a job, and it is best to have a “real world” writing sample, such as a contract you helped draft for an employer, than something written for a legal writing class.  , The Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) is required to practice in all but three jurisdictions in the United States. The exam is made up of 60 questions, which test your knowledge of legal ethics.You will take the exam in your third year of law school.  , Each state bar admits its own lawyers and administers its own bar exam. Contact the bar of the state where you wish to practice.They will provide you with a list of the necessary steps to take.  , In almost every state you have to pass a written exam before you can be admitted to the bar. The exam typically includes an essay portion as well as a multiple choice test.The bar exam is typically offered twice a year. There is usually a summer exam (offered in June or July) and a winter exam (offered usually in February). If you have to take the bar exam over, you have to pay each time you take it.  , You will need to prepare extensively for the bar exam. Most people try to take a bar prep course, which usually runs for several months. Costs can reach several thousand dollars.If you can’t afford a full prep course, then you might want to seek out old study guides published by bar prep companies. Many people sell old guides on eBay and other online retailers.  , In addition to passing the bar exam, you also need to pass a character and fitness review.You initiate the review by completing a detailed survey on your employment history, educational history, and criminal/financial history.   Common problems with character and fitness include criminal convictions, financial irresponsibility (such as bankruptcy), and accusations of plagiarism. These may not completely block you from admission, but be prepared to discuss them with the character and fitness committee. If anything looks suspect to the committee, it will call you in for an interview. Always be honest when filling out the background survey. It is better to be upfront than try to hide something and get caught.  , The bar exam is typically a two-day exam. One day consists of a multiple-choice exam covering topics such as contracts, constitutional law, criminal law, evidence, and torts.The other day will be made up of essays on state-specific topics.It will take several months to receive your score. In Illinois, for example, those who take the exam in July will not receive their results until the first two weeks of October., If you want to practice real estate with a large law firm or with a large corporation, then you will probably need to sign up for on-campus interviews (OCI) and interview. Before the start of your 2L year, large law firms and corporations interview students for summer associate positions at their firm (or in-house) for the following summer. If they like you, they will probably extend an offer to join them after you graduate.   Your Career Services office will send out detailed requirements for participating in OCI, such as preparing a resume and ordering copies of your transcript. Be sure to follow all policies to the letter, otherwise you could be prohibited from participating in interviews.  , Smaller firms often advertise online. You can check Craigslist, job aggregators like Indeed.com, and with your state bar association, which may have a jobs board. You will be asked to forward a resume, cover letter, and writing sample, so have those ready to go.   Smaller firms often want applicants to already have passed the bar exam, so you may not be able to search for these jobs until you have the results of the bar exam.  , Another way to find jobs is to meet with lawyers for informational interviews. After taking the bar exam, you should identify real estate attorneys whose practices you would like to learn more about. Draft a letter (not an email) and introduce yourself. Be sure to mention who gave you their name.   In the letter, explicitly state that you are not asking for a job. You will get a better response this way. The purpose of the interview is to create an initial contact. If you make a good impression, the lawyer may remember you later for a full-time job or for part-time contract work. Draft at least five questions about the lawyer’s practice and be engaged during the meeting. Take notes and ask follow-up questions.Ask the attorney if she knows anyone else you can meet with. Be sure to send a thank you note afterwards.  , If you cannot find a job after passing the bar, re-connect with attorneys you worked for during the summer or part-time during the school year. They may have overflow work for you to do, such as research assignments, contract review, or closings to attend.   You can also cold call other real estate attorneys and ask if they have any overflow work. If you do not have a job, you should be most focused on building your reputation and not be picky about how much you get paid. If you do good work for low wages (or even for free), then the attorney may come back to you with additional work.  , Even if real estate law is your dream, you need to start with a first job to gain legal experience (and pay the bills). Ideally, you could work for a general business lawyer, who may do real estate work as one part of his or her practice. Otherwise, you will need some sort of legal job in order to get legal experience.   Regardless of your first job, you can try to get real estate law experience in your free time. For example, you can do pro bono work. Volunteer at a local legal aid organization and help non-profits with their contract disputes, real estate closings, and other legal problems. You could also increase your familiarity with real estate issues by writing bar articles on real estate law, offering seminars to small businesses on real estate issues, or sitting on a local government board that handles land use and zoning.  , As your career advances, be sure to raise your profile by offering continuing legal education courses, joining bar association committees, and joining real estate bar associations. Many states, like Illinois, have a Real Estate Lawyers Association. Members are invited to events and seminar, and work together to address the concerns of the profession.   You can also seek board certification in real estate law, if your state offers it. Ohio, for example, offers two specialist certificates in real estate, one in Real Property—Business, Commercial, and Industrial Law and the other in Real Property—Residential Law.To earn the certification, attorneys must show that they devote a significant portion of their practice to real estate law, take advanced courses in the field, and submit references.In many states, they also must pass a written exam.

Pimples contain nasty bacteria. If you pop your pimples, that bacteria has a chance of getting inside other pores and giving them a place to stay without charging rent, so to speak. Make sure your pimples pay rent.; , Foundation and lipstick can be harmful to the skin. Although it may be a bit embarrassing going fresh faced if you have bad skin, going ""bare"" will definitely help your skin clear up.  , Inflammation will cause even more redness and pain.  , Your hands (no matter how many times you wash them) have oils and dirt on them, and are vectors for bacteria. If you're constantly wiping that dirt, oil, and bacteria back onto your face, chances are it's not going to respond too well and you will also end up spreading even more the bacteria to other areas of your face.  , Many doctors recommend that you drink between 9 and 12 cups of water per day (2.2 to 3 liters), depending on whether you are a girl or guy.(Women should drink 9 cups, men should drink 12.) Your skin is an organ in your body, too, and like your kidney, it needs adequate amounts of water to function properly.  , Although the evidence has been disputed for decades, new reports seem to indicate that diets do have a substantial effect on acne, listing sugar as a trigger.Sugars cause a spike in insulin, which in turn stimulates certain pimple producing hormones.  , Milk, too, has recently been implicated as an acne-producing agent. Milk stimulates male sex hormones — testosterone and androgens — that, along with insulin, cause nasty pimples., Green tea contains tons of antioxidants that help fight free radicals; free radicals affect the cells that may be responsible for signs of aging in the skin. For a healthy alternative to water, brew some tasty and healthy green tea!  , Diet can help your complexion look its best if you let it. There's nothing amazing about the following sentence, and you can probably guess what it's going to be: eat more fruits and vegetables, more healthy fats, and experiment with probiotics  ,, There's fat, and then there's healthy fat. Healthy fats, like omega-3s, help fight inflammation and promote healthy cells.Omega-3s are damaged by oxygen, meaning if you eat foods that are rich in omega-3s, try to eat them raw. In a pinch, baked or broiled is better than boiling or fried. Foods rich in omega-3s include:   Fish, particularly salmon, sardines, and herring.Seeds and nuts, particularly flaxseed.Leafy greens, particularly spinach and arugula., Probiotics are healthy bacteria found in certain foods, such as kombucha, that promote good digestive health and cut down inflammation. Probiotics such as lactobacillus may improve acne. Look for probiotics at your local grocer's or natural health store.  , This one is another no-brainer. The right kind of vitamins will help your body create vibrant, wonderful skin and fight acne to boot. Vitamin-A has been particularly effective in promoting healthy skin. Do not take vitamin-A if you are pregnant.  , Evening primrose oil is an anti-inflammatory omega-6 fat, a deficiency of which may cause acne.Take 1000 to 1500mg twice a day.  , Zinc citrate helps with protein synthesis, wound healing, and normal tissue function. Take 30 mg a day.  ,, Washing your face too much will only make your face dry, causing your face to produce more oils, which unfortunately equals more acne.  , Washing strips the moisture from your skin as it fights the acne-producing bacteria. Ensure that you give your skin the moisture it needs, even if you have naturally oily skin.  , This simply means that they won't clog your pores. You don't want your moisturizer to clog pores right after you've cleaned them.  , These kinds of moisturizers, as opposed to cream-based moisturizers, won't make your skin feel as clammy and oily.  , What is a toner? A toner is a lotion or wash that helps shrink your pores while cleaning grime and dirt away. Be careful about toners with alcohol because they will wipe away the oil from your face. This causes more oil to be produced, along with more acne. Find a toner that is low on alcohol but still effective.  , Doctors aren't completely sure why, but they do know that there is a link between stress and skin disorders, specifically stress and acne. Somehow, the cells that produce sebum, which is the stuff that ultimately causes acne, become unregulated when a person experiences a lot of stress., Some people detach from stressful situations by taking a walk. Others pour their stress out onto a canvas by painting. Whatever it is that you do to decompress, do it early and do it often.  , There are numerous meditation techniques, so find the one(s) that work for you. Some people choose yoga for meditation.  , Being sleep deprived can cause stress and increase acneAs we learned above, stress can have a deleterious effect on skin, causing acne. Speaking of sleep, change your pillowcase on a regular basis. Consider wrapping your pillowcase in a towel to absorb oil. You can flip the towel over the next night.  , Teenagers should try to get between 10 to 11 hours of sleep per night., For pretty much any ailment aside from muscle or bone damage, exercise is a panacea. Exercise is a great option for getting your circulation going, and anything that promotes good circulation also helps keep your skin healthy and vibrant-looking.A couple things to remember when you exercise:  , The benefits of getting your circulation jump started can be outweighed by the disadvantages of sun damage if you're not careful. Wear sunscreen that is light and doesn't irritate or sting your skin.  , When you sweat, your pores can get clogged with salty, dirty residue that's leftover from your workout. Be sure to wash your body, and especially your face, after you exercise.  , Benzoyl peroxide is used to kill the bacteria that contribute to acne. Benzoyl peroxide comes in different concentrations, but benzoyl peroxide with a 2.5% concentration is just as effective as 5-10% solutions, and it's less irritating to the skin to boot. Benzoyl peroxide also helps peel away layers of dead skin, leaving brighter, more rejuvenated skin in its place.  , Like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid kills bacteria responsible for pimple growth. It also causes skin cells to shed more rapidly, promoting the growth of new skin. Put small amounts of salicylic acid onto affected areas before you go asleep, after you have washed your face.  , Toothpaste contains silica, which is the drying agent you find in bags of beef jerky, among other things. Basically, toothpaste will dry out your pimple overnight, reducing it in size.  , Some toothpastes containing sodium lauryl sulfate can irritate the skin. Watch out for it before applying.  , Tea tree oil is an antibacterial essential oil that can blast the microbes that have started to make a home inside of your pores. With a dropper, dab a Q-Tip with a bit of tea tree oil and apply to pimples as needed, being careful not to put on too much.  ,, Crush up an aspirin tablet and add just enough water to make it into a paste. With a Q-Tip, add the aspirin paste to the pimple(s) lightly, covering entirely. Let dry. Aspirin is another anti-inflammatory, meaning it will help the skin fight against inflammation, making the pimple less visible. Let the aspirin paste fight the pimple overnight.  , Astringents are agents that cause the skin to contract or get smaller. Some pharmaceutical astringents contain antimicrobial ingredients that will help fight the pimple in addition to reducing the size of the pimple. Here are some astringents to consider using:  , These come in different types and sizes. Look for one that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Ask for astringents that are gentle on the skin.  , They include:  , The citric acid here kills the bacteria that cause acne and act as a skin-tightener. Many people swear by it. Slice a lemon and gently rub it over the affected area.  , Banana peels are helpful in treating insect and mosquito bites, and may be helpful in reducing the size of some pimples. Gently rub the banana peel over the affected area.  , Another great astringent with a ton of applications. Look for witch hazel that doesn't contain alcohol. Apply a small bit over affected area and let dry.  , Green tea is an astringent that's packed with lots of antioxidants, which help reduce signs of aging by fighting free radicals. Steep a tea bag in some hot water, remove the tea bag along with all the liquid, and place onto affected area briefly.  , Rub an ice cube over the acne on your face until the area goes numb. When your face goes numb, stop; leave your face alone until it's warm again.  , If your acne is painful, it should help ease the pain.  , When one section goes numb, move to the next section.  ,, Eye drops, at least the ones that reduce redness in the eyes, can be helpful in reducing redness and signs of irritation in acne. Drop a few eye-drops onto a Q-Tip and apply as necessary onto the pimple(s).  , The cold Q-Tip will soothe as it reduces inflammation.  , Antihistamines suppress the swelling effect in the skin tissue of people. Most of these remedies can be ingested in pill form, but some can be consumed as tea or used as a topical agent. These should offer a reduction in redness. Natural herbal antihistamines include:  , This may sound weird, because touching nettles in the wild can produce a rash not unlike small pimples. Some doctors, however, recommend taking a freeze-dried preparation of stinging nettle, which is known for its ability to reduce the amount of histamine the body produces.  , Europeans have a long history of using the plant to cure skin conditions. The leaves can either be ground up into a paste or coltsfoot extract can be ingested in pill form.  , Heat a couple sprigs of basil leaves up under some steam and apply gently to the hives. Basil may help reassure the body that the foreign agent causing the hives is not something it should be fighting.  , There are antibiotics and other oral acne medications that can target infected skin and clear it up very fast.

Agents and editors don't take well to book's that are ""for all ages."" If you want to write a bestseller, it's important to have a niche age range in mind.Things like picture books and stories with only a few words are usually for ages 2 to 6. Middle graders are generally ages 8 to 11. These would be stories targeted at mid-elementary school and early middle school. If you want to write for very young children, you can consider doing a picture book or a baby book.  , You do not want to go into the market without a clear genre. Many popular children's books are fantasy-based in nature, or feature talking animals. If you want to write a bestseller, fantasy may be a good idea. However, some famous children's books, like Kevin Henkes's Lily's Purple Plastic Purse, feature an animal character that faces a realistic setting. It can be nice to write a children's book with a story children can relate to.Pick a genre that interests you. You're unlikely to stick with a project if you do not enjoy the genre. You're vastly more likely to produce an interesting product people will want to buy if you're passionate about your work. If you're a lifelong animal lover, for example, think about writing an animal book for children. Include animals as the main characters.  , There is a lot of competition in the world of children's books. If you're going to survive and become a bestselling author, figure out what makes your story unique. What unique experience can you bring to the table? What's a story that only you can tell?Look at what's already out there. Familiarize yourself with the more popular children's stories so you don't produce a replica of an already established work. Try to see where there's room for diversity. Look at what the market is lacking. Think about your own life, experience, and passions. Maybe there's something unique about you that could help your work stand out. For example, there are lots of children's stories about animals, but how many stories feature a sugar glider? Maybe you own a sugar glider, and could tell a unique story from your pet's perspective.  , Reading as much as you can is a vital part of the prewriting process. Surround yourself with the most popular and prominent works in children's literature. Look into your target age range. Stop by a local library and ask a librarian for recommendations in that range.Pay attention to how the stories begin. Does the work begin with action, dialogue, a scene? How does the author get you interested in the story? What makes the characters compelling right away? Focus on characters. In a children's book, characters may be somewhat simple in nature. Focus on language. Children's books are often written in very simple prose. They may also make use of things like rhyme, as they're often meant to be read out loud. Watch how the story ends. What resolutions are made? How have the characters changed? Is there room left for a sequel, or are all ends tied up?  , Children need to be able to become invested in the main character in your book. As you write your children's book, focus on creating a main character with a lot of attitude. A fun, charismatic main character will get children invested quickly.Look at Kevin Henkes's Lily in Lily's Purple Plastic Purse. Lily is cute, charismatic, and excitable. She is a character children can get behind. Give your character flaws, however. Every story needs a conflict. Lily, for example, is overeager and somewhat temperamental. This is what causes her disagreement with her teacher. Figure out one or two flaws your character can have that will ultimately drive the story's conflict.  , One of the things that makes bestsellers compelling is they present a relatable experience, but find a way to make it extraordinary. Oftentimes, otherwise ordinary settings, like a boarding school or a small town, turn out to be dangerous. Children feel they are being let into the adult world when innocence is removed from a typical setting.Think about Roald Dahl. Much of his stories take place in an ordinary setting that suddenly becomes frightening. In Matilda, for example, a conventional boarding school turns out to be a terrible place for the students. If you're doing a longer children's book, one that's the length of a chapter book, you could think of a similarly unexpected setting. Think about a setting children are familiar with. For example, you could write about a school. A young child could discover his school is haunted, for example. This takes a setting children are familiar with and adds something a bit scary to it.  , Children face challenges in their day-to-day lives. They must overcome fears, confront challenges, deal with conflicts with friends and parents, and so on. Children want to read a book that reflects the conflicts they face. Think about a conflict you could introduce that your character must overcome.Look at something like the Berenstain Bears series. Most of the books center around a conflict related to young children. In ""The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with Junk food,"" for example, the children learn about healthy eating after a stressful doctor's appointment. The conflict is usually fairly easy to overcome, and helps teach kids a lesson. Think about a conflict that will get a child emotionally invested in a story. If you know any children, think about the kinds of conflicts they have. For example, maybe your niece Rosa struggled to fit in during Girl Scout meetings. Her friend Harper helped her overcome her shyness by sticking by her side during meetings. You could easily write a fun and relatable children's book based on this experience, focusing on themes like friendship and community.  , Most children's books teach something to children. Sometimes, that message is practical. Children's books sometimes teach things like proper manners, or vocabulary. However, the message can also be more abstract. Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, for example, teaches about appreciating people over products. An inspiring message like this can really help your story resonate with kids.Think about what children need to learn. What did you have to learn as a child? Think about a memorable moment that taught you a lesson. Maybe, after your grandmother entered hospice care, you realized you never valued her enough. Through this, you learned to gain wisdom from past generations. You can work this lesson into a story. Talk about a young child who learns to value the stories his grandmother told him more, teaching him the importance of history and family.  , If you want to write a children's book, work on getting organized. You should form a writing schedule for yourself. Work writing into your weekly routine, like exercising, doing your dishes, and brushing your teeth.   Clear out a space to write in your home. Clear off a corner of a desk, or pick a spot in your bedroom. You can also write at a local coffee shop. It's important you pick a space free of outside distractions so you can focus on your work. Schedule time for writing. Think about when you feel most energetic. Some people feel invigorated in the mornings, while others feel enthusiastic later at night. Write during the time of day you feel most energetic. Set goals each day. You can have a specific word count, such as 100 words per day, or you can write a set number of pages each day. If you do not have time to write each day, set weekly goals. For example, you can promise you'll have 5 pages by the end of any given week.  , Children have a limited vocabulary, so you do not want to use too many big words. You should also minimize excessive language. Stick to simple sentences that convey the basics. Things like rhyming and rhythm can also help. Think of the works of Dr. Seuss. He makes excellent use of rhyme to make his stories compelling to a young audience.   You can use some big words in a story. In fact, children may benefit from learning new words in a book. If you choose to use large words, find a way to explain them. Weave high-brow vocabulary words into your story in a smooth fashion.For example, maybe you can have a character who works very hard at school and is a bit of a show off. He or she could use big words on occasion, and make a point of explaining these words to others.  , Almost all children's books are illustrated. If you're not artistically inclined yourself, team up with an illustrator. The two of you can create compelling images for your story that will make the book aesthetically pleasing.Go to your friends who draw and ask them for advice here. Ask them if they would be willing to work with you. You can also post an ad online, on a site like CraigsList, seeking out illustrators for your book. Due to modern technology, you are not limited by location. You can find illustrators across the country. You can browse websites where people share their art. If you find an artist you like, reach out to him or her. Keep in mind a lot of artists will expect payment for their work. Budget for this.  , Much of writing takes place during revision. After finishing a draft of your story, do many, many revisions. Most successful books were revised multiple times before publication.   It's a good idea to have a print copy of your manuscript to revise. That way, you can make notes as you go. Ask yourself if the story moves quickly enough, if the plot is relatable to children, and if the conflict is solved in a rational manner. Evaluate your writing. Does the dialogue feel natural? Are the characters, settings, and scenes described in a compelling manner? In addition to major overhauls, watch for easy fixes like grammar issues. When you start sending your manuscript to publishers, it should be free of obvious grammatical errors.  , Children's stories should not be simplistic in nature. Many people think you have to teach a lesson in your story. However, children are complex. Avoid simple lessons. Instead, explore a variety of complex themes. Many children's books explore wide-reaching themes like bravery, war, conflict, and parent/child relationships without explicitly providing their readers with a lesson about such subjects. It's okay to leave ambiguity in your work., You're more likely to land an agent if you build a relationship with fans ahead of time. You can start a website or a blog about your book, and offer promotional materials like sneak previews, character profiles, and more. A lot of modern authors get their start online.You can use free sites like WordPress to create a blog. Work on updating your blog regularly and try to post content that people will share. Readers often respond to easy-to-read content, such as lists. Create a social media presence as well. Link your blog to your Twitter, a Facebook fan page, and your Tumblr. You can try starting a YouTube channel, making short videos where you discuss writing, your book, and children's literature in general.  , Networking is one of the main ways people get into publishing. If you get a short piece published in a journal, stay in touch with the editor. If you have an MFA in fiction writing, talk to your professors and colleagues. Attend reasonably priced writing conferences and try to meet agents and publishers.  , It is very hard to get a children's book published without an agent. Many big publishing houses do not look at unsolicited submissions. You will need an agent if you want to write bestsellers.You can find agents online through sites like Writers Market, Agent Query, and Query Tracker. Write a query letter to potential agents. This should briefly overview your publication history, online presence, and include a brief biography. You should also provide a synopsis of your book. Include a few sample chapters in the envelope you send to the agent. Follow all submissions guidelines carefully. Make sure you send in your chapters in the manner the agent prefers, following all the guidelines for formatting your manuscript exactly as requested.  , The process to becoming an author, especially a bestselling author, is long and difficult. You will get a lot of rejections from agents and publishing houses along the way, so learn to cope with rejection.Send out work frequently, and to a lot of different places. You're less likely to be stung by a rejection if you have a lot going on. A rejection from one agent will hurt less if you've already submitted to five. Also, keep in mind rejection is rarely personal. Most authors get rejected a lot, especially early on. Your work may not have been the right fit, it may have been too similar to another title, or the agent simply may not have had time to read it closely. A rejection does not mean you are a bad writer.

Whether you’re trying to convince your spouse, your parents, or your siblings, you’ll first need to have a frank talk. Ask your loved ones to sit down so you can communicate your desire with them.Let your loved ones know that you want to have an important talk, i.e. “Bill, I have something really important that I want to talk about with you. Can we sit down together?” This will help them focus their attention and also communicate that they should take what you have to say seriously. Pick a good time and place for your conversation. Choose a moment when your loved ones are not busy but can give you all their attention. You might approach them in the evening, for example, after they return from work and are settling down. Choose a moment when your family members are relaxed and at ease. Avoid bringing up the subject in a public place or if you are fighting.; , The whole point of talking to your loved ones is to propose family counseling, so be direct and to-the-point. At the same time, be prepared for some possible push-back. Approach the topic gently and with patience and try not to get angry or defensive.Try saying something like, “Maria, I’ve been thinking and wonder if we might communicate better with some help. What do you think about family counseling?” Show empathy, i.e. “I know this is a hard conversation, but I’m only saying this because I care about you and our relationship. I wouldn’t be asking if I didn’t love you and want things to be better between us.” Since your loved ones might not be receptive to what you say, consider using “I” statements, i.e. “I think that family counseling could help us” or ""I'd really try and find a way to stop fighting with you, and I think having some help would be useful for me."" This wording can help you express your feelings but avoid language that assigns blame to others.  , Your loved ones might be more receptive to the idea of family counseling if you focus on how it can solve problems. Stress the practical element: how therapy together will teach you to fix problems in your relationships and communication, rather than the chance it gives you to vent your feelings.For instance, you might say something like “I want to get counseling so that we can learn to get along better and find compromises” rather than “I want to go to counseling so you can understand me better.” Point out that family therapy can show you problems in your behavior and family roles, teaching you how to work through issues. Family therapy can also allow you and loved ones to improve your ability to communicate, express thoughts and emotions, and solve problems together.  , Your loved ones ultimately have a choice: they might be receptive to counseling or they might not. People may be afraid, distrustful, or skeptical that therapy can work. But even with a refusal, don’t lose hope. There are still other alternatives to family counseling that can help you and loved ones improve your relationships.For instance, propose a weekly family meeting where you can talk about the state of your relationship. Or, promise to spend 10 minutes every day listening to your loved ones’ feelings. You can also try self-help material. Books like Getting the Love You Want and The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work explore things like communication and dealing with conflict and power struggles in relationships. Don’t forget that you can seek counseling on your own, too. Every member contributes to a family’s dynamic and is responsible on some level for the quality of relationships. You can learn a lot, even if your other loved ones aren’t present.  , In general, family therapy is useful in dealing with problems that arise in family relationships. However, there are different focuses. Family therapists can help parents cope with a child who acts out, for example, or improve spouses’ person-to-person communication. The type that’s best for you largely depends on your needs.Are you dealing with an at-risk child? There are family therapies that focus on kids and adolescents who show behavioral problems, delinquency, or substance abuse. Does a family member have a drug or alcohol problem that is affecting the group? This can be another focus of therapy. There are also family therapists who work on marriages or help families cope when a member has a severe physical or mental illness.  , Your primary care doctor should be able to refer you to a therapist, if you express the desire to see one. You might also get advice from another medical professional like a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, or nurse. Just ask. They should be able to give you advice, suggest names, and to help you find someone in your area.Ask plenty of questions about potential therapists. What are his or her training and credentials, for example? Are they licensed and do they specialize in family psychotherapy? Ask too about location, availability, and format. How long is each family counseling session? How many sessions are usual? Is the therapist available in emergencies? Inquire about cost and insurance, as well. How much does the therapist charge per session? Does she require full fees paid up front? Will she accept payment from your insurance provider?  , Check online for family therapists and family therapy resources, too. Start with a general search in your area, like on Google, i.e. “Family therapists in Baltimore,” but don’t neglect other specialized search engines. There are a number of therapy websites with special tools to find practitioners around the country.Psychology Today hosts a Therapy Group search engine on its website, for instance. You can search your locality and then narrow the results to find specialists in things like divorce or family conflict. A second tool is the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy’s therapist locator. Search by the name of your area to find lists of nearby licensed Marriage and Family Therapists.  , Apart from your doctor and online resources, you might also consult with local health organizations in your area. Contact places like hospitals, mental health clinics, community centers, or even university counseling services to see if they offer family therapy sessions. You can either call, inquire in person, or send an email.For example, call your local hospital and ask what kind of family counseling services they can provide. Some places, like the Rhode Island Hospital, run family therapy clinics for help in a range of psychological issues. Most universities also have counseling services – including family therapy – on campus for students and staff. Contact a college or university near you to see if you can make use of their programs.  , You’ll also want to know what sort of methods your potential therapist will use in treatment. Family counseling can draw on a number of techniques, each with their own assumptions and goals. The method may depend on your situation or on the therapist’s preference.Ask if Structural Family Therapy is for you. SFT assumes that problems are inside of the family structure – that is, the therapy focuses on interactions in the group rather than on the individuals. The idea is for the therapist to change the family’s ingrained ways of interacting.You might also ask about Brief Strategic Therapy. This form of counseling is short and tries to take stock, again, of how the family interacts as a system. The therapist will try to identify problems and will then set goals for change, alongside “tasks” for members to do outside of sessions. Consider Functional Family Therapy, too, especially if you have an at-risk child. FFT tries to lower the negativity that’s often found in such families, by focusing on changing behavior at the individual level. This can take place by working on members’ skills in parenting, communication, and problem solving., Most people think that family counseling involves the entire family (or both members of a couple) in the same room. This is only part of it. Family therapy can take place in group sessions, but the therapist may also want to meet individually with each member of your family. Be prepared to participate, whether on your own or as part of the group. In fact, the cooperation of each member will be key to the counseling’s success.Some therapists prefer to have the whole family together in sessions. More often, though, you should expect to have some full sessions in addition to some apart or in smaller groups with the therapist. Sessions typically last for about 50 to 60 minutes each. Family therapy courses are also usually fairly short and last no longer than 6 months.  , One of the basic ideas behind family counseling is to see you and your loved ones as a unit. Families are not just isolated individuals, but made up of people who are part of social groups and systems. Each member of a family influences the behavior of the other members, father, mother, sister, brother, and other relatives.Say that you are in therapy to address behavioral problems with your child. A therapist can help connect the child’s problems to what he experiences as a member of the family. Perhaps he is doing poorly in school because a parent has been laid off; perhaps he acts out because he overhears arguments and is afraid his parents are going to divorce. A family therapist might also ask you to change your behavior and relationships with other members of the group. For instance, she might ask you to change how you communicate with loved ones.  , Family therapy has to include a good deal of exploration of you, your loved ones, and your roles in the larger unit of the family. Getting family counseling may well teach you a lot about how you interact, express your thoughts and emotions, and solve or create conflicts.One of the therapist’s aims is to help you see how you and your loved ones interact, i.e. what are the family roles, rules, and behavior patterns. Then, with this knowledge, you can find ways to work out issues more effectively. A therapist can also point out your family's strengths and areas that need improvement. Perhaps you are close knit and loyal to each other, but do not express emotion easily. The therapist might then focus on encouraging you to communicate more easily and openly. Armed with knowledge, family therapy should help you find ways to cope with family conflict and, ideally, gain a better sense of understanding with your loved ones.

Quite possibly, this other person hurt you dearly. You'll want to grow from this situation by turning lemons into lemonade, but to do so, you should take a little time for yourself.   In the heat of the moment, your emotions can cloud your judgment. That means that it's hard to think straight, and you could end up saying things that aren't exactly helpful in fixing the situation. How you feel is very important, and it's a big part of regaining trust, but it's also not productive if you don't step away for a little bit. It's going to be hard not to think about what happened, but try to. At least for a little while. Do something so engaging that you become completely enthralled in the now — go away to a cabin by the lake with your friends, go rock climbing and sweat a little, or have a great conversation with a total stranger. For the time being, forget what happened.; , You are a victim of the circumstances, but don't become the victim.Do you see the difference? The victim of circumstance understands that the betrayal of trust was one incident, while the victim feels like the entire relationship — all the good along with the bad — is now affected. The victim of circumstance wants to get over the incident; the victim wants to wallow in the pain that the other person caused them. Staying the victim sets up a big roadblock to regaining trust in someone.  , Especially after a betrayal in a relationship, it's easy to feel like the world is being turned upside down and you're in a free fall, disconnected from everything you thought you knew. It's a very disheartening feeling. But it's not the truth. There's still plenty of brightness in your life if you know where to look. Reminding yourself of this simple notion can do a lot to help rebuild trust.   Take a look at the simplest things in life that you still have. Your friends, family, and health are three profound things that you most likely still have, even if the person who betrayed you feels connected to each one of those things. Fall in love again with just how lucky you are to have these things. Try to look at the positive side of things. It may seem funny to think of a betrayal as having positive aspects, but it's certainly possible. Here's the big one: You've learned a lot about the other person as well as about yourself. If you choose to continue the relationship, you'll want to use these teachings to make sure it doesn't happen again.  , When someone we care about deeply betrays us and misplaces our trust, one of our gut reactions is to try to punish them for hurting us. If our boyfriend cheats on us, we go out and get cozy with that guy we once had a thing for; if our friend lies to us, we justify lying back to them. Try not to do anything crazy before thinking about it first. Here's how you might go about it in your head:   Ask yourself: Are you doing this for yourself or in order to hurt the other person? If you're doing this for yourself, then go ahead — you earned it. But if you're doing something in order to hurt the person who hurt you, ditch the need to ""get back at"" the other person. When you try to put back together the pieces of your relationship, these actions will only stand in the way of making everything good again.  , After taking a little time for yourself to sort through things, get social again. There's nothing quite like social contact to remind you that the world goes on. And while no one is forcing you to move on with your life quite yet, it's a good idea to get some perspective on things. Perspective helps. Friends, colleagues, and even total strangers will help you get that.   Listen to your friends, but take anything they say with a grain of salt. They're probably somewhat disconnected from what happened, and they have a natural tendency to want to comfort you. (That's part of what they're there for.) Just don't take for granted that they know everything that's going on, or that they know what's best for your relationship.  , While it’s sad to see any relationship go — whether it's a friend or lover — sometimes the betrayal is a wake up call and a sign that there are many fish in the sea. Looking at the relationship as a whole should help you decide whether you want to regain trust in the person or whether you'll probably want to move on.   What was the relationship like before the incident? Did you have fun and laugh frequently? Or did you feel like it was a constant chore and you were doing most, if not all, of the work. Did you feel listened to? Was your word as important as theirs? Were lines of communication free and open, or closed and constrained? Did you feel that you could rely on this person? Was the relationship balanced or was it one-sided and not in your favor? Was the betrayal out of character or, in retrospect, might you have seen this coming? Does the person have a history of breaking the trust of their friends or lovers?  , This is another important exercise in self-discovery you should try to complete before you decide to allow yourself to trust the person who betrayed you. After all, if you're looking for the right things in the wrong places, you might do better to ditch this person and find someone else. It's hard to say, but it's tough medicine.   Are you in a relationship because you need someone to complete you? This may be a problem. Asking someone to complete you is an impossible task. Only you can do that. If you're in a relationship because you need one in order to feel ""whole"", you should probably consider taking a break from dating. Are you asking for people to hurt you? Do you always date the same kind of person — the person who ends up hurting you in a fiery, dramatic spectacle? You might subconsciously be asking to be hurt because you don't think you deserve better. Well, you do. Improve your self esteem and don't settle for the kind of person you know will hurt you.  , Sure, grading someone sounds callous, but it is an effective and honest way to assess whether or not this person meets your needs. Besides, we deserve five-star relationships, so make sure that's what you've got.   Identify three to five things you value most in a relationship. For some people laughter and emotional support will be among their top needs. For others, intellectual stimulation is a top priority. Using your grading system, determine whether or not this person is meeting your needs and is compatible with your values. For example, if the person shares all your values and did an excellent job of meeting your needs except for the betrayal, it might be a good idea to give them a second chance. On the other hand, if the person doesn't really share any of your values but is an overall good person, the betrayal might mean it's time to move on.  , Indeed, some people are not deserving of your trust. But sometimes, a mistake hurts because it reminds us of previous a wound. A betrayal that is calculated or born of malicious intent is a clear indication that this person is no one you can trust. But mistakes that are accidental and out of character may deserve forgiveness. Consider the following:   Was it a calculated deceit, for example a cheating spouse, malicious gossip or sabotage by a co-worker? Was it accidental, like crashing your car or spilling the beans on a secret? Was it a one-time slip, or does the incident represent a long-standing pattern of behavior? Consider the circumstances: Is your friend or loved one going through a particularly trying time and could this have played a part in the injury?  , Was it mild, moderate or severe? The severity of the betrayal is often going to be a good sign of the degree of pain the other person put you through.    Mild offenses include blurting a secret, telling 'white' lies (lies that are told to spare your feelings, as opposed to lies told to deceive you) and complimenting your romantic partner in a way that may have seemed flirtatious. These tend to be accidental and one-time incidents. Generally, if you express your concerns, they are met with an immediate and sincere apology and a promise to be more mindful of your feelings in the future.  Moderate offenses include gossiping about you, regularly borrowing money but rarely repaying you and regular disrespect. These behaviors reflect a lack of consideration and selfishness. It can be difficult to confront someone who seems indifferent to your feelings, but sometimes people are just oblivious. These flawed behaviors can be sometimes be talked through and resolved.  Severe betrayals include stealing a significant amount of money, infidelity, spreading malicious gossip or lies, and sabotaging you at work or in some other endeavor. These are calculated betrayals, the perpetrator is aware of the grief he or she will cause and does it anyway. In such cases, you may need to seek professional guidance to salvage the relationship, if indeed you decide to forgive.  , If you’ve decided to forgive and move forward, one of the best ways to let go of resentment, anger and suspicion is to remind yourself of all of the wonderful things this person brings to your life. There's probably a reason — hopefully a lot of reasons — why you stayed in the relationship. Think about those as you begin to let the other person in.  , It's hard to do, and it's not necessarily expected of you, but it will help save the relationship if that's what you want to do. Try to imagine what drove the person to betray you, indirectly or directly. Try to think about how the person feels at this very moment. You shouldn't make any decisions just because you pity someone, but showing empathy is an olive branch that will mean a lot to the other person.  , Be clear about your feelings, and give the other person a chance to speak. At the same time, know that asking for specific details can make the pain even worse.This can make the healing process even harder.   Discuss the event. Explain how you interpreted the event and why you were hurt. Avoid accusatory language. Give the other person the opportunity to explain the situation from their perspective. Establish your expectations and ask what is expected of you. This will help clarify the cause of the current problem, as well as avoid future disagreements. Don't expect to get through talking about the incident in one sitting. Make that clear to your friend or partner. The healing process is going to take some time, and that person should be prepared to talk about it for some time. If they're not prepared to, that's a sign that they may not care as much about mending the relationship as you do.  , Often, hurtful behavior has much more to do with the other person than it does with us. Rather than face their own issues, people project them onto a close friend, family member or partner. If the incident was borne of the other person’s insecurity, help him or her deal with the pain. This will help you view the incident with compassion and help you to forgive. Here are a few examples of hurtful behaviors that are not personal attacks:   Someone makes a snide comment about your appearance because he or she feels unattractive. A partner flirts to feel desirable, not because you are unloving or unlovable. A friend is hyper-competitive because she feels inadequate. You are sabotaged by a co-worker because he fears his work is inadequate.  , If you fear the relationship or friendship just isn't going to work, but want to try anyway, you may as well throw in the towel right now. If you decide to give it another try, believe that it will work, not because you want it to, but because the other person has earned it.   Don't constantly live in fear of the same betrayal happening again. Try to get back to normal as much as possible. If you find yourself living in the constant shadow of the betrayal, that's a sign that it's time to get out — both for your sake and for the other person's.  , Likely, forgiveness gave you the opportunity to be a kind and more responsible human being. Forgiving another allows you to pass that gift on to someone else.

People might be hesitant to admit that they have used a debt relief lawyer. However, they might know of someone else who has. In this situation, people might tell you the name of the lawyer that person used.; , Your local or state bar association probably runs a referral program or can point you in the direction of an approved referral program.Contact the bar association and ask for a referral for a debt relief lawyer.   You can find your bar association by searching the Internet. Type “your state” or “your city” and “lawyer referral.” The referral service may give you the name of one attorney, or it may host a database that you can browse.  , Lawyers are another great source for referrals.If you used a lawyer on a real estate matter or to write a will, then you can ask him or her to recommend a debt relief lawyer.   Lawyers often know the reputations of other lawyers in the community, so they should only refer you to someone that the lawyer feels is qualified. Reconnect with your attorney by stopping in or calling. Briefly explain your situation and ask if they know a debt relief lawyer you could call.  , Once you have the names of several attorneys, you should do some preliminary research. You want to find lawyers who are experienced in debt relief and who run professional law firms. As you browse each lawyer’s website, look for the following:   Relevant experience. You want to hire a lawyer who has handled debt relief matters before. Some lawyers might specialize in only debt relief. If the lawyer runs a more general practice, then look to see if any debt relief experience is specifically mentioned. A lawyer’s profile should contain information about his or her experience.Client testimonials. Lawyers often include a few sentences from former clients testifying to the good experience they had with the lawyer. Grammar and spelling. The website should be free of grammatical or spelling errors. Also, if the website talks about legal concepts, it should do so in an understandable way. A lawyer who doesn’t care how he comes across on his website will probably be sloppy in his legal representation.  , You should narrow your list of attorneys to two or three. If none of the lawyers look appropriate based on your review of their websites, then you should contact your bar association again and get more referrals.   Try to keep your list short. You need to set up consultations. You might not have enough time to meet with more than three lawyers.  , Once you have narrowed your list of attorneys, you can set up consultations with each. Most lawyers offer 15-30 minute consultations.Depending on the lawyer’s schedule, you might need to set up a consultation by telephone.Although a telephone consultation is not as ideal as meeting with a lawyer face-to-face, you should consider a telephone consultation if you liked the lawyer’s experience and website. Many lawyers now offer free consultations. However, some might charge a modest fee (around $25-35). You shouldn’t automatically dismiss meeting with a lawyer who charges a small fee. These lawyers sometimes are more willing to share information about how to defend yourself. If you are thinking about representing yourself, then paying a small fee might pay off down the road.  , You should prepare for your consultation by pulling together relevant documents which will give your lawyer a good sense of your debt. For example, you should gather copies of the following:any letter or email you have received from the creditor any communication from a debt collection agency information on the debt, e.g., the original loan documents financial information, such as how much you make and your monthly expenses  , There should be time during the consultation to ask the lawyer some questions. You should prepare a half dozen questions. Try to avoid asking a question if you can find the answer on the attorney’s website. For example, most lawyers should include information about what law school they went to and how long they have been admitted to practice. Instead, think about asking these questions:How much of the lawyer’s caseload involves representing clients on debt matters? Has the lawyer handled a case like yours before? Has the lawyer negotiated with your creditor or the collection agency before? What percentage of cases successfully settle? (Say upfront that you know the lawyer cannot promise a result.)  , Always remember to talk about how much the lawyer charges.Typically, lawyers have charged by the hour. They set an hourly rate and then bill you every month for the amount of time they have spent on your case.  , Lawyers are very busy and often try to squeeze consultations in between trips to court. You should try to arrive fifteen minutes early. Give yourself enough time to find parking.   If you are running late, then be sure to call the lawyer’s office as soon as possible. You may have to reschedule the consultation or conduct the consultation over the phone.  , Every lawyer belongs to at least one state bar. Each state has set up a disciplinary commission to investigate allegations of attorney misconduct. If the commission finds that the lawyer has violated the code of ethics, it will discipline the lawyer.Lawyer ethics cover such things as keeping a client’s confidences, billing and handling a clients’ money appropriately, and not representing clients if there is a conflict of interest. When a lawyer violates any of these ethical rules, he or she can be sanctioned. Find your state’s disciplinary commission on the Internet and search for the lawyer’s disciplinary history. There should be a notation of any discipline.  , Many websites now host reviews of lawyers and law firms. These should pop up on the first few pages when you perform a web search for the attorney. Clients now leave reviews on websites such as Avvo, Yelp, and Google.You should certainly look at these reviews. However, you should take them with a grain of salt. Because many reviews are anonymous, there is no way of knowing whether the reviewer was actually a client or not. Also, some clients are impossible to please. A negative review might not actually reflect the lawyer’s skill. However, be on the lookout for repeated complaints about the same thing. If more than one person complains that the lawyer doesn’t bill accurately, then this could reflect a real problem.  , There are some signs, or “red flags,” that you are dealing with a bad debt relief lawyer. Pay attention to the following and avoid the lawyer if he or she did any of the following during your consultation:The lawyer promises a quick resolution. No lawyer can guarantee that settlement negotiations can be conducted quickly. Generally, it can take several months of back and forth before reaching a result. The lawyer swears that you need a lawyer. Actually, you can negotiate on your own behalf. Although you might not be as experienced at negotiations as a lawyer, it is false for a lawyer to suggest you absolutely must have a lawyer. The lawyer wants to bill a set amount each month. This is not a productive way of charging a client. Flat-rate billing actually increases the amount of time it can take to settle a matter because the lawyer has an incentive to drag out negotiations.  , A lawyer is ethically prohibited from telling clients that he or she can “guarantee” a result.Instead, a lawyer can generally discuss your chances based on the lawyer’s experience and the strengths and weaknesses of your case.   For example, a lawyer can say, “I have negotiated settlements with that credit card company before, and the company was very eager to settle. I think your case is about as strong as the other cases. So it depends on whether the credit card company is still as eager to settle as they used to be in the past.” An unethical attorney would say, “I can guarantee that I will reduce your debt by 50%.”  , There are many quality debt relief lawyers who can help you. Just as you must guard against hiring a bad lawyer, you should be on the lookout for these signs of a good attorney:Explains the case in a way that you can understand. This shows that the lawyer cares about your opinion. You can’t actively participate in your own settlement if you don’t understand what is happening. Only tries to charge you for work done. The lawyer should send you an itemized bill, showing what tasks were performed and how much was billed for each task. Promises to work diligently on your behalf, but doesn’t promise specific results. Describes the bankruptcy process and the fact that your entire debt could be wiped out in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is always an option. If you want to pursue bankruptcy, then the debt relief attorney should be able to provide you with a referral to a bankruptcy attorney.  , Once you have eliminated any bad lawyers, you should review the remaining candidates. If all of the candidates you consulted with were bad, then you will need to start over and get more referrals. However, if you found some acceptable, then make a choice about who to hire.   It is important that you feel comfortable with whatever lawyer you choose.You will be working closely with the attorney, and you need to hire someone you feel at ease with. Think back to your consultation. Did you feel comfortable asking the lawyer questions? Did she answer them in a way that you understood? You should trust your gut. So long as the lawyer has sufficient experience, charges a reasonable fee, and makes you feel comfortable, then you can’t choose wrong.  , After notifying the lawyer that you want to hire them, you should receive a letter in the mail. This is called the “engagement letter” or “employment agreement.” It tells you exactly what work the lawyer will perform, and explains fees and expenses. The agreement should also explain your obligations as a client (such as being cooperative and paying bills in a timely manner).Once you receive the letter, read it carefully and make notes about anything you don’t understand or anything you disagree with. Contact your lawyer to discuss these problems. Once you have resolved any differences, ask the lawyer to send you a clean engagement letter and sign it. Keep a copy for your records.

They can advise you about your options: abortion, adoption, or keeping the baby.   Your doctor should not pressure you in any direction. They should simply provide you with information about what options are available to you. If you are considering an abortion, you may wish to prepare a list of questions to ask your doctor. You may feel embarrassed or shy about talking to someone about an abortion, but your doctor is there to help you. If you feel pressured by the doctor to not have an abortion (for a reason that doesn’t directly pertain to your health), consider looking for another doctor.; , If you are an adult, you do not need to tell anyone about your decision to have an abortion. You may, however, wish to tell a trustworthy friend or family member to help support you during the procedure.If you are under 18 and wish to have an abortion, you may be required to get a parent’s permission, or, if you do not wish to inform your parents, a judge’s permission, before you may have the procedure. This policy varies by state, and most states have parental notification laws. Know your state’s parental consent policies., Because abortion is a controversial procedure, there is a lot of misinformation floating around about abortion and its effects. Do your research. Talk to your doctor. Look for information from government publications or reputable news sources.   Use caution when doing online research. Beware of any website that seems to push an overtly pro-choice or pro-life agenda. Know that abortion is safe. Only one percent of abortions have complications.Know that abortions will not cause breast cancer. Additionally, an uncomplicated abortion will not cause infertility or trouble for future pregnancies.Abortion will not cause “post-abortion” syndrome or other mental health issues. It is, however, a stressful event, and some women find themselves having a more difficult time following the abortion, due to preexisting mental health conditions or a lack of a support network, for example., Medical, or non-surgical abortions, can be done up to ten weeks (70 days) from the first day of the woman’s last period. Your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam, usually including an ultrasound, and then prescribe mifepristone (or sometimes methotrexate) and misoprostol.If you are able and willing to pursue a medical abortion, you will first take the mifepristone, which blocks your body’s production of progesterone, a hormone necessary for pregnancy. After 24-48 hours, you will take the misoprostol, which causes the uterus to empty. You will have cramps and heavy bleeding, usually within 4-5 hours of taking the medication. Once this is complete, you will need to see your doctor to make sure your body has expelled all of the tissue. Follow-up is absolutely necessary, to ensure that the pregnancy was successfully expelled. Failure to expel the pregnancy completely could lead to serious complications and infection.The benefits of a medical abortion are that it can be done at home, and can be done early in the pregnancy (as soon as you know you are pregnant). However, there are also risks of the abortion being incomplete. If it is, then you would likely need a surgical abortion., A surgical abortion, also known as suction aspiration abortion, can be performed if you are under 14-16 weeks pregnant (this may vary by provider). The procedure involves dilating the cervix and inserting a small suction tube into the uterus to remove the pregnancy tissue.The actual aspiration, or abortion procedure, takes only a few minutes. Most of the time spent in the clinic or doctor’s office will be spent waiting for pain/relaxation medication to begin to work, as well as dilating your cervix to create an opening large enough for the suction tube to fit through. Your cervix may be dilated with metal rods of increasing thickness, medication, or dilators that expand through fluid absorption.You will spend at least an hour in recovery to ensure there were no immediate complications from your procedure. You may be asked to schedule an additional follow-up appointment. If you are over 16 weeks pregnant, you will have a procedure known as a dilation and evacuation (D&E). This is similar to the aspiration abortion, though it requires more time and equipment. You will likely have a slower recovery than with an aspiration abortion., As you consider what to do about your pregnancy, think about what is currently going on in your life and consider how a pregnancy or baby would impact it. You may want to spend some time thinking through some issues on your own.   Consider your financial situation. Are you able to afford having a baby and raising it? Think about your personal beliefs about abortion. If you do not feel comfortable with abortion, would you consider putting the baby up for adoption? Think about your health. Would being pregnant be harmful to your body or mental state? Would you be able to handle the emotional and physical impact of having an abortion? Think about your support network. Who would help you raise the child? Would the baby’s father be involved? If you had an abortion, who could be there to support you?, Talk to your partner, loved ones, or friends who you know won’t judge or influence your decision. Many women feel alone when dealing with an unwanted pregnancy. Talking to trustworthy members of your support network may help you feel less isolated.If the father is present and involved in your life, you may wish to speak to him about what he would like to do. Remember, you do not need his permission to get an abortion. If you feel he may pressure you one way or another, however, you may wish to avoid telling him. Don’t let anyone pressure your decision. If your friend says something like, “If you have an abortion I won’t be able to be friends with you anymore, because I believe abortion is wrong,” you could say, “I’m sorry you feel that way, but please don’t put pressure on me. I need to do what is best for me.” Talk to someone who has had an abortion. If you know of anyone who has had an abortion, ask what their experience was like, and how they look back on it positively or negatively. You could ask, “Are you comfortable talking about your abortion? Could I ask you a few questions about it? I’m pregnant and I’m not sure what to do.”  , Your doctor, family planning clinic, or community health agency may know of counseling services that can help you decide what to do. Make sure the resources they give you are unbiased, nonjudgmental counseling services that do not attempt to push the woman toward one option or another.   Do your research on any names or agencies you receive to make sure they are unbiased. Look for any affiliations that may seem questionable to you (political or religious). Understand that any reputable agency or counselor will help you explore all your options without judgement or coercion. If you feel pressured into making a particular decision, find someone else to talk to., If you are considering abortion, you do need to make a decision as quickly as possible. While you want to be certain of your decision, also understand that the earlier in the pregnancy you decide to terminate it, the easier your procedure will likely be. You will also have more options available.   In most states in United States, you cannot get an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy, unless the pregnancy is a risk to the mother’s health., If you are still unsure of what to do, you may wish to write a list of the pros and cons of terminating your pregnancy. Seeing your thoughts and feelings on paper may help you reach a decision more easily.   Write down the positives and negatives, no matter how big or small they seem. Compare your lists. You may want to weigh all three options (parenting, abortion, or adoption) or just two if you know you are not ready to be a parent, for example.  , Once you have made your decision, take your next steps quickly. If you are choosing to continue with the pregnancy, you will still want to follow up for prenatal care as soon as possible. If you decide to have an abortion, schedule it as soon as you can.   Keep in mind that you may need to travel to a clinic, and factor in some states’ mandatory waiting periods as well. Consider any financial needs you may have in order to pay for the abortion. If you are planning to continue the pregnancy, be sure that you are not smoking, drinking, or using drugs, eating well, and are taking a prenatal vitamin that includes folic acid -- a necessary nutrient for a developing fetus., Consider discussing your future birth control needs with your provider or at your family planning clinic at your next appointment. Research options online and speak to your doctor about options that may work best for you.   If you decide to have an abortion, you may be able to have an IUD (intrauterine device) inserted at the time of your abortion procedure. Check with your doctor about this option. While it prevents pregnancy, it does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.If you have a regular sex partner, discuss with them what protection you’d both like to take going forward.

If you've never exercised before or are returning to exercise after a few weeks or months off, talk to your doctor first. Get a clearance from them that you can be active. Ask your doctor if there are any exercises you should avoid, how long you can exercise for and at what intensity. For example, ask: what exercises should I avoid? Is there a time limit on my exercise routine? How many days a week can I exercise?; , Also consider seeing a personal trainer to make sure you're on the right path with exercise. These fitness professional can give you hands on guidance on how to safely return to an exercise routine.   After meeting with your doctor and getting a clearance for activity, sign up for a few sessions with a personal trainer. Make sure to relay any guidance provided by your doctor so the trainer knows what they can and cannot suggest for you. You might want to schedule just a few sessions to help get professional guidance as you ease back into a good routine. A trainer can make sure you're doing exercises correctly, using proper form and doing a variety so you don't overwork your body.  , To help you layout your plan and help you be consistent, create an exercise plan. This can help give you a vision and pathway as you ease into a new exercise routine.To help you figure out how much exercise to do, when your rest days are and how long you're exercising for, make an exercise schedule. This will help you stick to your routine and make sure you have the time to exercise during the week. Studies have shown that you're more likely to stick with an exercise routine if it's been pre-scheduled into your week. Write in what exercise you plan on doing, for how long, at what time and where. Use your date book or calendar and do this for at least one week in advance.  , When you're planning out your new exercise routine, try to choose activities or exercises that you'll actually enjoy. This is important so that you can ease into a routine you'll stick to long-term.When you're thinking about easing into an exercise routine, you'll have to think about what types of exercises you want to do. For example, do you want to run? Do you want to incorporate aerobics classes? Do you want to bike? If you choose exercises that you don't really like, that are too expensive or are too difficult, you're more likely to stop or give up over time. Really consider what is realistic for you and what you enjoy. That way, as you ease into an exercise routine, you'll stick with it.  , When you're easing back into an exercise routine, you might be excited for your new plans. However, you need to make sure you take it slow and don't overdo it initially.   Going slowly when you're easing into an exercise routine is important. You'll be able to focus on your form while you exercise and take extra time to listen to your body. The quality of exercise is much more important than quantity and how much you do.If you exercise too long or too hard to start, you're risking an injury or excessive soreness. This is an essential component of easing into a routine. For example, choose lower intensity, lower impact exercises (like walking) and only do them for 15 to 20 minutes. Or if you're restarting strength training, use a 5 pound dumbbell instead of the 10 or 15 pound dumbbell you were using previously.  , One essential component to consider when you're easing into an exercise routine is your body's signals. Listen to your body and take care to keep yourself safe as you become more active.   When you're just starting with an exercise routine, it's essential that you really pay attention to how your body feels during and after exercise. Your body will tell you when you've done too much or are working too hard. Pay attention to signals like: nausea, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, sharp pain, excessive soreness or extreme fatigue.If you're noticing any of these symptoms, you've most likely pushed yourself too hard. Lessen the time or intensity of your exercise until you build up more strength. If you have any chest pain, difficulty breathing, dizziness or pain that doesn't go away, call your doctor immediately and do not restart exercise until cleared.  , When you're easing back into an exercise routine, you may find it difficult to stick to your routine. It takes a while to get into a routine and a friend can help you.   Studies have shown that when you have work outs planned with a friend or family member, you're more likely to go and be consistent long-term.Ask friends, family members or co-workers if they'd be interested in exercising with you a few days a week. Consider getting together with someone who is also considering easing into an exercise routine. It'll be fun to do this together.  , When you're easing back into an exercise routine, you have to think beyond your activity. Choosing appropriate exercises and being safe is important, but so is getting adequate rest each night.   Exercise is physical work and stressful to your body. Although it's beneficial and healthful work, it's still work and your body needs to get adequate rest after being active.When you're easing back into exercise, your body will be burning more calories, using more energy and engaging muscles more strenuously. Make sure to get at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. And if there are days where you feel more tired, go to bed early or sleep in occasionally for a rest day.  , If you're just starting back with exercise, one area that you can focus on initially is your lifestyle activity. You can make a lot of changes here without worrying about overdoing it.   Lifestyle activities are those exercises that you do as part of your normal daily routine. They can include things like: walking to and from your car, taking the stairs at your office, doing household chores or lifting the laundry basket.Lifestyle activities are generally not overly strenuous and are not done for long periods of time. This makes them a safe way to increase your activity without worrying about injuring yourself or doing too much too quickly. Think about your typical day and consider when you can add in more movement. Can you take more steps? Can you use the stairs more often? Are there times when you could be standing instead of sitting?  , When you're working on finding the right combination or right type of exercise to do, don't forget to include a warm-up and a cool-down. These are essential as you ease yourself back into a routine.A warm-up and cool-down are designed to help your body get ready for exercise and recover after performing exercise. Not including them, especially when you're initially restarting exercise, can increase your risk of injury.A warm-up should be done immediately prior to your exercise routine. In general, do something light and slow for about five minutes. For example, your warm up could be a slow walk or using the elliptical without any resistance. After you've completed your workout, end with a cool-down. Slowly bring down the level of your exercise and finish with stretching. Again, this should last for about 5-10 minutes.  , Walking is one of the oldest forms of exercise and it's perfect for easing back into an exercise routine. Start walking more regularly to help build up your strength and conditioning.   Walking is a low intensity and low impact exercise. It's perfect for a variety of fitness levels and ages.If you're just starting out with exercise, try going for a 10 minute walk in your neighborhood or on the treadmill. As this becomes easier, slowly increase your distance or time. Try increasing your time or distance by 10% each week.  , Another great exercise to try is water aerobics or swimming. Again, this is a low impact exercise that can make easing into workouts a little bit easier.Water aerobics and swimming will give you a great cardiovascular workout. However, the buoyancy of the water takes your weight off your joints which can help prevent excessive force and pounding on your body. This is great if you feel like you might have some joint pain or soreness associated with exercise. Many water aerobics classes can be 45 to 60 minutes long. If you're just starting out, tell the instructor you're new and are planning to only stay for half the class or until you feel fatigued.  , Another fun aerobic exercise you can add in is biking. It's easy on your joints and you will have full control over the resistance and difficulty of this exercise.Biking is considered a good beginner exercise because there is no pounding on your joints. It's also great if you're easing back into a routine. You can choose to either bike outdoors or try out a spin class. Biking outdoors allows you to go at a leisurely pace. Spin classes are typically higher in intensity. However, you can do a spin class and let the instructor know you won't be using a lot of resistance or do higher intensity bouts since you're getting back into your exercise routine.  , Yoga is a well known low impact and low intensity exercise. This is a great form of activity to start with especially if you want to work on improving your strength, balance and flexibility.Like walking, yoga is great for a variety of people. You don't have to be in great shape, you don't have to be strong or overly flexible. It's perfect for varying fitness levels. To start, take a beginners yoga class or even yoga for arthritis. These easier forms of yoga can get your body moving without increasing your heart rate or having you do poses that may be too advanced.  , When you're easing into your exercise routine, strength training might make you a little nervous. Some people opt for weight machines because they seem easy to use, but using a pair of light hand weights when you are just starting out might be a better option.   While there are benefits to both free weights and weight machines, using free weights offers you more options for exercises, more range of motion, and a more effective strength training workout.Try using a pair of light hand weights to do some basic strength training exercises, such as bicep curls, shoulder presses, and tricep presses. You can do these exercises at home or at a gym. If you are not sure where to start with free weights, and you feel more comfortable using weight machines instead, then that is also fine. Just keep in mind that it is important to use these machines properly to avoid injury. Ask a gym employee if you are not sure how to use any of the machines.  , Once you've been cleared by your doctor and are slowly getting back into the routine of exercise, work on meeting the recommended amounts of cardio each week.   The CDC recommends that healthy adults include at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardiovascular exercises each week.You need to be doing these exercises for at least 10 minutes at a time for them to count towards this goal. Moderate intensity exercises are those that increase your heart rate and blood pressure slightly. You should be able to talk while you exercise, but only in short sentences before taking a breath. Remember, you may not be able to meet this goal initially. That's OK. This could be a moderate or even a long-term goal to work towards.  , In addition to cardio, it's also important to include adequate amounts of strength training. These exercises offer additional health benefits and should be included weekly.   Again, the CDC has recommended that healthy adults include one to two days of strength training every week.These exercises should be done for at least 20 minutes total and should work every major muscle group in your body. In addition, it's not recommended to do strength training of the same muscles or muscle groups two days in a row. Always separate days of strength training of the same muscles or muscle groups by a day of rest or cardio activities only. This recommendation can also be a long-term goal if you cannot do this level of activity initially.  , Stretching and flexibility exercises are always an important component of your exercise routine. However, they become more important when you're easing into or back into your exercise routine.Don’t worry about stretching before you exercise. It is best to wait to stretch your muscles until after they are warmed up, so focus on stretching after you are finished with your workout. Stretching helps to improve your flexibility. In addition, you're more likely to be sore and tight when you're starting in with exercise again. Stretching after your workouts can help to alleviate these symptoms.  , In addition to getting in all the right amounts of activity and including regular flexibility training, you also need to give your body a rest.   When you're easing into an exercise routine, it's essential that you take your time and go slowly. This means including adequate rest days. In fact, you may need to initially include more rest days than you will later down the road. It's during rest that your body and muscles recover. Your muscles grow in strength and size while performing essential repair functions.Initially include two to three rest days a week. Once you progress and get stronger, you can knock this amount down to one to two rest days a week.

The basic field compass, also sometimes called a baseplate compass, features the following simple components you should familiarize yourself with as soon as possible:   The baseplate is the clear, plastic plate on which the compass is embedded. The direction of travel arrow is the arrow in the baseplate pointing away from the compass. The compass housing is the clear, plastic circle that houses the magnetized compass needle. The degree dial is the twistable dial surrounding the compass housing that displays all 360 degrees of the circle. The magnetic needle is the needle spinning within the compass housing. The orienting arrow is the non-magnetic arrow within the compass housing. The orienting lines are the lines within the compass housing that run parallel to the orienting arrow.  ; , Place the compass flat on your palm and your palm in front of your chest. This is the proper compass stance, when traveling. If you're consulting a map, place the map on a flat surface and place the compass on the map to get a more accurate reading.  , For a quick basic exercise to orient yourself, it's good to find out which direction you're currently facing or traveling. Look at the magnetic needle. It should swing off to one side or another, unless you're facing North.           Turn the degree dial until the orienting arrow lines up with the magnetic arrow, pointing them both North, and then find the general direction you're facing by looking at the direction of travel arrow. If the direction of travel arrow is now between the N and the E, say, you're facing Northeast.  Find where the direction of travel arrow intersects with the degree dial. To take a more accurate reading, look closely at the degree markers on the compass. If it intersects at 23, you're facing 23 degrees Northeast.  , While it might seem confusing that there are two kinds of ""North,"" it's a basic distinction that you can learn quickly, and it's an essential piece of information to learn to use a compass properly.True North or Map North refers to the point at which all longitudinal lines meet on the map, at the North Pole. All maps are laid out the same, with True North at the top of the map. Unfortunately, because of slight variations in the magnetic field, your compass won't point to True North, it'll point to Magnetic North.  Magnetic North refers to the tilt of the magnetic field, about eleven degrees from the tilt of the Earth's axis, making the difference between True North and Magnetic North different by as many as 20 degrees in some places. Depending where you are on the surface of the Earth, you'll have to account for the Magnetic shift to get an accurate reading. While the difference may seem incidental, traveling just one degree off for the distance of a mile will have you about 100 feet (30.5 m) off track. Think of how off you'll be after ten or twenty miles. It's important to compensate by taking the declination into account.    , Declination refers to the amount by which North on your map and North on your compass differ at any given point, given the Earth's magnetic field. To make using the compass much easier, you can correct for declination by either adding or subtracting the declination amount from your bearing in degrees, depending on whether you're taking a bearing from a map or from your compass, and whether or not you're in an area with East declination or West declination.          In the US, the line of zero declination runs up through Alabama, Illinois, and Wisconsin, at a slight diagonal. East of that line, declination orients toward the West, meaning that Magnetic North is several degrees West of True North. West of that line, the opposite is true. Find out the declination in the area in which you'll be traveling so you can compensate for it. Say you take a bearing on your compass in an area with West declination. You'll add the number of degrees necessary to get the correct corresponding bearing on your map. In an area with East declination, you'll subtract.  , When you're hiking around in the woods or in the field, it's good to periodically check your bearings to make sure you're going in the direction you intend. To do this, move the compass until the direction of travel arrow is pointing in the direction you've been traveling and will continue traveling. Unless you’re heading north, the magnetic needle will spin off to one side.          Twist the degree dial until the orienting arrow lines up with the north end of the magnetic needle. Once they're aligned, this will tell you where your direction of travel arrow is pointing. Take off local magnetic variation by twisting the degree dial the correct number of degrees to the left or right, depending on the declination. See where the direction of travel arrow lines up with the degree dial.  , To do so, simply hold the compass in the proper stance, turn your body until the north end of the magnetic needle once again aligns with the orienting needle, and follow the direction of travel arrow. Check your compass as often as you need to, but be sure not to accidentally twist the degree dial from its current position.         , To accurately follow the direction of travel arrow, look down at the arrow, then focus on a distant object like a tree, telephone pole, or other landmark, and use this as a guide. Don’t focus on anything too distant, like a mountain, as huge objects aren’t precise enough to navigate by accurately. Once you reach each guide point, use your compass to find another.   If visibility is limited and you cannot see any distant objects, use another member of your walking party (if applicable). Stand still, then ask them to walk away from you in the direction indicated by the direction of travel arrow. Call out to them to correct their direction as they walk. When they approach the edge of visibility, ask them to wait until you catch up. Repeat as necessary.   , Place your map on a horizontal surface, then place the compass on the map so that the orienting arrow points to true north on the map. If you know your current position on the map, slide your compass around so that its edge passes through your current position, but its orienting arrow continues to point north.          Draw a line along the compass edge and through your current position. If you maintain this bearing, your path from your current position will be along the line you just drew on your map.  , To find out which direction you need to travel to get somewhere, place the map on a horizontal surface and place your compass on the map. Using the edge of the compass as a ruler, place it so that it creates a line between your current position and where you intend to go.         Rotate the degree dial until the orienting arrow points to true north on the map. This will also align the compass’s orienting lines with the map’s north-south lines. Once the degree dial is in place, put the map away. In this case, you'll correct for declination by adding the appropriate number of degrees in areas with West declination, and subtracting in areas with East declination. This is the opposite of what you'll do when first taking your bearing from the compass, making this an important distinction.  , Hold the compass horizontally in front of you with the direction of travel arrow pointing away from you. Use this arrow to guide you to your destination. Turn your body until the north end of the magnetic needle is aligned with the orienting needle, and you'll be properly oriented toward the destination on the map.         , One of the most difficult and advanced things you can do with a compass, but one of the most important, is finding out where you are when you don't know your exact location on the map. By locating distinctive landmarks you can see on your map, ideally as widely spread around your field of view as possible, you can get yourself re-oriented.         , Unless the landmark is north of you, the magnetic needle will spin off to one side. Twist the degree dial until the orienting arrow lines up with the north end of the magnetic needle. Once they are aligned, this will tell you where your direction of travel arrow is pointing. Correct for declination, depending on your area.         , Place your map on a horizontal surface and then place the compass on the map so that the orienting arrow points to true north on the map. Then, slide your compass around so that its edge passes through the landmark on the map, while the orienting arrow continues to point north.         , Draw a line along the compass' edge and through your approximate position. This is the first of three lines you will draw to find your position by forming a triangle with the other two landmarks.         Repeat this process for the other two landmarks. When you’re done, you will have three lines that form a triangle on your map. Your position is inside this triangle, the size of which depends on the accuracy of your bearings. More accurate bearings reduce the size of the triangle and, with lots of practice, you may get the lines to intersect at one point.

Babies’ immune systems are not as well-developed as those of adults, so bacteria that wouldn’t make older people sick can be harmful to an infant.  Scrub your hands thoroughly with soap. Don’t forget to include under your nails and between your fingers. Rinse your hands in warm running water. Let the water run over your hands and wash away any dirt or bacteria that may be there. Dry your hands with a clean towel.; , If you express or pump at the times when your baby would normally feed, this will help you to continue making milk on schedule for your baby. You do not need to wash your breast or nipple before expressing milk. You can start the milk flow by sitting in a quiet place and thinking about your baby. If you have trouble, you may want to try:Looking at a photo of your baby Holding a blanket or item of clothing that smells like your baby Gently massaging your breasts or nipples Putting warm, wet compresses on your breasts  , This technique has the benefit that it is convenient and free. You don't need to bring any specialized equipment with you. It may require some practice. Once you are good at it, it can be as fast as pumping.Put your thumb and forefinger on opposite sides of your areola. Move them backwards against your chest. Gently squeeze your fingers together while moving them slightly towards your nipple. Your fingers should not slide along your skin. Release the pressure. Continue this process while moving your fingers to different positions around your areola. Collecting the milk can be difficult when expressing milk by hand. Try expressing into a large, clean bowl or a sterilized container with a large mouth — you may want to place these containers on a table that is about hip-height or hold them with one hand. You can also express into a milk storage bag, holding the bag with one hand and using the other hand to express the milk., There are two main types of pumps: manual and electric.Manual pumps require that you work it with your hand. It requires some skill and practice. This option is generally best if you only need to pump occasionally. It may also increase your risk of a breast infection. Manual pumps generally cost $50 or less. Electric pumps run on batteries or electricity. They can also pump both breasts simultaneously. They usually cost between $150 to more than $250. Pumps must be washed with soap and water between uses.  , There is a difference between pumps that are available for purchase and pumps that are available to rent. Rental pumps are closed system pumps, which means that there are certain parts of the pump that never come into contact with the milk. A purchase pump is an open system, which means that the pump motor comes into contact with the milk. Unfortunately, the way the open system pumps are built means they cannot be completely sterilized, like a rental pump. So, if you use a secondhand pump, your baby may receive particles of another mother's milk.Viruses such as HIV (AIDS) can be spread through breast milk. Rental pumps can be obtained from hospitals or breastfeeding organizations. Breast pumps must be covered by health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.  , It is important that the container be sterile and strong enough that it won’t break. It should also be BPA-free.You can store the milk in a sterile bottle. The cap must be water- and airtight so that it cannot spill or get contaminated. Bottles with screw tops work well. Bottles have the advantage that they are stronger and less prone to tearing and leaking than bags. Because milk expands as it freezes, do not fill the container to the brim. Bottles can be sterilized by using a commercial cold water sterilizing solution, steam sterilizing, or boiling. Follow the bottle manufacturer’s directions for how to sterilize your bottles. The directions may instruct you to boil the bottle for several minutes. Steam sterilizers can be purchased at your local pharmacy. You can purchase bags designed for storing breast milk at your local pharmacy or any store that carries baby items. Bags can be put into a plastic container to protect them while they are stored. Do not use ordinary thin plastic bags or formula bottle bags because these are not as strong. They are more prone to tearing. Write the date on the container so that you will know how long it has been stored. If you are providing the milk to someone else, like a day care agency, label it with the child’s name. You may also want to write how many ounces you pumped so that you will know how many bags you need to thaw at a time.  , The fresh milk is warmer and it will cause the frozen milk to partially thaw, providing the opportunity for bacteria to grow.If your baby does not drink all of the milk from one feeding, do not save the milk to be used again. Some people find it useful to store each 2 to 4 ounces separately. This means that you only need to thaw the amount for one feeding.  , The amount of time that you store milk depends upon the temperature at which it is stored. The following guidelines are for healthy infants that were carried the full term. For premature or sick infants, follow the guidelines provided by your hospital or doctor.Milk can be kept at room temperature (77°F or 25°C) for no longer than six hours. It should be kept cool and covered. If the room is warmer, you should not keep it for longer than four hours. Milk can be kept in an insulated cooler bag (5 to 39°F or -15 to 4°C) for 24 hours. Ice packs should be in the insulated bag with the milk. Milk can be stored in a refrigerator (39°F or 4°C) for five days. The temperature will be the most constant at the back of the refrigerator.  , If you store the milk at the back of the freezer, the temperature will be the most constant. This will minimize temperature fluctuations that occur when you open and close the freezer. If milk is stored for longer than the amount of time listed, it starts to degrade and is less nutritious.Milk stored in the freezer section of a refrigerator (5°F or -15°C) can be stored for two weeks. Milk stored in a separate freezer section of a refrigerator (0°F or -18°C) can be kept for three to six months. The freezer compartment should have a separate section so that the temperature doesn’t rise every time someone opens the refrigerator. Milk stored in a deep freezer (-4°F or -20°C) can be kept for six to twelve months.  , This will help you to avoid storing milk too long or wasting it. In addition, the nutrients in human milk change over time so that the milk provides your baby with what it needs at the current time. This means that by preventing some milk from getting too old, you make sure that your baby gets what they need at each feeding.After three months, the fats in frozen milk begin to degrade, reducing the nutritional quality of the milk.The milk loses vitamin C over time, so the sooner you use it the better.  , The milk should be fed at body temperature. If your baby will drink cold milk, you can also feed them directly after taking it out of the refrigerator. Thawed breast milk may look a little different or have a consistency that is a little different from fresh milk. This is okay and it is still safe to feed to your infant. Thawing can be done either in the refrigerator or using warm water.If you plan to use the milk the next day, you can put it in the refrigerator to thaw overnight. Milk can also be thawed by running the closed, watertight container under warm water or putting it in a bowl of warm water. Milk that is thawed should be used within 24 hours or thrown out.  , A microwave will heat the milk unevenly. This means that some of the milk might be too cold and some might be so hot that it might burn the baby.Bottles that are heated too quickly may explode in a microwave. If the milk is heated too much the nutrients may start to degrade, making it less nutritious for the baby. Heating the milk too fast may damage the antibodies in the milk that help build up the baby’s immune system.  , Breast milk can be given warm or cold; however, if it is too hot it may burn the baby.Swirl the milk gently to mix it. This will mix and distribute the cream part, which rises to the top, throughout the milk. Do not shake the milk because that can cause some of the nutrients to break down. After swirling, apply a few drops to the inside of your wrist. It should be warm but not hot. It should not feel uncomfortable.

In making this determination, consider:   Are you seeking to file bankruptcy for an individual or a business? A bankruptcy attorney will most likely have more experience in one classification or the other. If you are having difficulty with personal finances and do not have the ability to pay existing debts, you may be looking to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If you want to restructure your debt so that you can make monthly payments, and you have a steady income, you may want to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. If you do not qualify for Chapter 13 bankruptcy because your debt is too great (with unsecured debt of more than $336,900 or secured debt of more than $1,010,650), you may be able to restructure your debt through Chapter 11 bankruptcy. ; , Someone you know and whose opinion you value may know of a good bankruptcy attorney. A personal referral can let you know how it was to work with a particular attorney and whether they would recommend that person. , If you know any attorneys or tax preparers, you should ask them whether they can recommend a good bankruptcy attorney. Often professionals maintain a list of other professionals whose services their clients may need. They may be able to provide you several names of attorneys in your area whom they recommend to their own clients.  , There are a number of ways to find experienced attorneys in your area. Most state and local bar associations provide attorney referral services. Bankruptcy associations also maintain lists of bankruptcy experts. You can find a list of state and local bar associations at: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx. The Consumer Bankruptcy Association maintains information about referrals and attorneys on its website at: https://nacbanow.com.  , In compiling your list of bankruptcy attorneys, you should narrow your list by area of practice. You want an attorney who specializes in the type of bankruptcy that you need. For example, if you need an attorney who handles bankruptcy for businesses, eliminate any attorneys who specialize in consumer/individual bankruptcy. , Once you have gathered the names of several bankruptcy attorneys, you want to examine their experience. Consider the following:   Focus not only on how long an attorney has been practicing law, but also how long they have been practicing bankruptcy law. Whether bankruptcy is the main focus of their practice? Do they have specialization certificates in bankruptcy? Are they members of bankruptcy organizations?, You should be able to find a lot of information about attorneys online. Conduct an Internet search for each attorney’s name, and evaluate the search results with an eye towards whether or not the material indicates specialization, success, and experience in bankruptcy law.   Read through any client reviews. Closely evaluate an attorney’s website for professionalism and indications of areas of practice. Consider the attorney’s educational background. Read articles or blog posts they've written. , Contact state and local bar associations to determine whether the attorney has ever been disciplined or if any complaints were filed against them. If unhappy clients filed the complaints, you may want to consider using a different lawyer.   You can also ask whether the bar association certifies bankruptcy attorneys and, if so, ask whether the attorneys you are researching are certified bankruptcy experts. , After you have completed your research, narrow your list to the top three or four candidates. You should contact the attorneys to see whether they offer free or discounted initial consultations. If none of the attorneys offer those services, begin by making appointments with just two of them (to save yourself some money).   When making your appointment, consider how you were treated on the phone. Was the staff courteous and professional? Their conduct reflects on the law practice as a whole. , In an initial consultation you'll probably have only an hour with the attorney, so come prepared with questions you want to ask (discussed below) and also with copies of your financial documents. When gathering these documents, be sure to:   Compile a list of all present and past debts, property that you own, and all of your financial accounts with balance information. Bring a copy your tax returns and paycheck stubs. Bring a copy of the deed to your house, if applicable. , When you meet with the attorney, notice how they are treating you, whether they meet with you personally (rather than having a staff member do it), and whether they answer your questions clearly. Additionally, evaluate their level of experience in handling bankruptcy cases like yours. Some questions that you should ask the attorney include:   Have they handled bankruptcy cases similar to yours? How long have they been practicing bankruptcy law? How many bankruptcy cases do they file each month? You want an attorney with significant experience in bankruptcy cases but not one who files a lot of cases a month, because they may not be able to provide you with individual attention. , Once you discuss your financial background with the attorney and show him or her your financial documents, you want to evaluate how the attorney would proceed with your case. The strategy may change once the attorney has more time to review your materials, but you can still get a sense of their approach, style and knowledge.   Ask the attorney what type(s) of bankruptcy may be right for you. This provides you with additional information about types of bankruptcy and gives you an opportunity to evaluate the attorney’s legal knowledge and demeanor in speaking with clients. Ask who would be handling your case and whether they would be available to answer your questions on a moment's notice. You want to make sure that the attorney isn’t going to pass your case to someone outside of the law firm. Some firms, known as bankruptcy mills, take more cases than they can handle and then retain outside lawyers to take over cases. You do not want to retain a bankruptcy mill. , When making your appointment, you can ask what the attorney charges for a typical Chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy. Realize that many attorneys want to evaluate a case and meet with a client before discussing the particulars of their fees. When evaluating fees, you should:   Call several attorneys in the area and ask what they charge for a typical Chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy. This will give you a starting point to evaluate the reasonableness of the fees. When discussing a fee, ask what specifics the fee will cover. Generally for Chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy filings, a flat fee should include: a consultation and evaluation of your financial situation; preparation of all court filings; and representation at the bankruptcy hearing. Most flat fees will not include representing you at a contested hearing. If the attorney is offering a fee that is much lower than that of other attorneys, consider the possibility that s/he is quoting a fee without properly considering your specific case. Attorney’s fees vary by location. Nationally, between the years 2005 and 2009, average attorney’s fees for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy ranged from $1,080 to $1,200. Recently in Idaho, fees have ranged as low as $700, while in Arizona they've climbed to as much as $1,530. Generally fees between $1,200 and $2,500 are considered reasonable. In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, attorney’s fees between $2,500 and $5,500 are typical depending on location.Most bankruptcy attorneys will expect you to pay your fees even before they file your Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, attorneys may allow you to pay some of your fees through a payment plan after they have filed your case. , After meeting with the attorneys you should take some time to compose your thoughts on each one. It is important to consider the following for each candidate:   Whose background and skills seem most in line with your needs? Who seemed to exercise the best judgment when offering advice? With whom did you feel most comfortable interacting? Whose fees seemed reasonable and fair compared with those of other attorneys? Will you receive individual attention? , When choosing a bankruptcy attorney you must look for certain warning signs that indicate that an attorney may not be reputable or experienced. During your initial consultation watch for the following warning signs:   Was the initial meeting run by the attorney or by another staff member such as a paralegal? If you did not meet with the attorney, the firm may be a bankruptcy mill that will not provide you and your case individual attention. How long did the meeting last? If the meeting was 30 minutes or less and the lawyer did not get into the specifics of your case, this may reflect a bankruptcy firm that will not provide you with individualized attention. Most initial meetings should last around an hour so that the lawyer has a chance to understand the specifics of your case. After the meeting did you understand your options for filing bankruptcy? If you leave the meeting without having a good sense of options, the attorney did not provide you with enough information. Did you feel pressured to sign a fee agreement? Attorneys realize that you may need time to consider all of your choices. If an attorney pressures you to sign a fee agreement immediately, they may continue to exert pressure on you throughout the case, which is not conducive to a good working relationship. , After you have weighed the pros and cons of each attorney, choose the one that will meet your needs, provide individualized legal services, and with whom you feel most comfortable.   Once you have decided on an attorney, sign the fee agreement and pay your retainer. If you don’t feel comfortable with any of the attorneys you've visited, trust your instinct and interview others.

To qualify for SSDI, on the other hand, you have to have earned a certain number of work credits before you became disabled.   Income for SSI purposes includes any money being paid to you such as wages, rental income, investment income. Other benefits you're receiving such as worker's compensation are also included in your income.; , To qualify for SSI disability benefits, your income must fall below the FBR, which in 2015 was $733 a month for individuals or $1100 for couples.   All income of anyone living with you is considered, not just yours., SSI allows a single person to have $2,000 in resources, while a couple can have up to $3,000 in resources. Resources include property such as land, vehicles, or stocks and bonds that can easily be converted to cash.You're allowed to exclude the house you live in and the land it sits on, as well as one vehicle. Everything else should be listed and appraised if necessary so the claims representative has all the information she needs to assess your qualifications., To be eligible for SSDI, you have to pass both a recent work test and a duration of work test. These tests prove you've worked long enough before filing to have contributed a specific amount of money to the Social Security system.   You can earn a maximum of four work credits each year, or one per quarter. The amount of money changes each year, but in 2015 you earn one work credit by earning at least $1,220 in a quarter.The older you are, the more work credits you need to be eligible. For example, if you're 31 years old or more, you won't be eligible unless you've worked at least five of the last 10 years before you became disabled. However, if you are between the ages of 24 and 31, you are eligible for benefits if you worked at least half the time between the onset of your disability and when you turned 21.In addition to the recent work test, you must also meet the duration of work test, which requires you to earn a certain number of credits for a certain number of years of work. For example, if you're between 31 and 42 years of age, you need to have earned at least 20 work credits over the course of five years of work.If you haven't earned enough work credits to qualify for SSDI, you may still qualify for SSI if your income and assets fall below the benefit limits., You must meet the financial need and work history eligibility requirements before your application can move forward in the process. Your claims representative won't send your application on for a disability determination unless these requirements are met., The SSA allows you to apply for benefits in person at your local SSA office, over the phone, or online.   The SSA requires all SSI applicants to meet with a claims representative, so if you're also filing for SSI it would be more efficient for you to apply over the phone or in person than to apply online.You can apply over the phone by calling 1-800-772-1213. You don't have to call ahead and make an appointment before you go to apply in person, but doing so could decrease your wait time., The SSA requires you to submit certain documents to prove statements you made in your application.   You will be required to show a birth certificate, Social Security card, or other proof of identity and U.S. citizenship. You should also bring any medical records or doctors' reports you already have in your possession. If you don't have all your medical records, you can still apply for benefits. The SSA will help you get the documents you need to complete your application.If you're applying for SSI and need proof of income and assets, bring financial documents such as bank account statements and pay stubs, as well as tax documents such as tax returns and W-2s or 1099s., Before the SSA grants you SSI benefits, you must meet with a claims representative who will ask you questions about your medical treatment, work, and personal finances.   If you're also applying for SSDI, the same claims representative will review both applications at the same time.If you have problems with memory or concentration, write down information about your work history and medical treatment so you'll be able to answer any questions the claims representative has.You should also write down dates and locations of important life events, such as marriages or the births of any children.Make a list of all your doctors and their addresses and phone numbers, as well as the dates of all your appointments with them and what treatment you received on each occasion., Meet with your claims representative when your interview is scheduled and bring along any documents or other information that could support your application or anything you plan to say to the claims representative.   The claims representative will ask questions about your previous work history, what duties you performed at work, what you were paid, and how your disability has affected your ability to perform those duties at that level. She needs to determine if you also are unable to do any other types of work for which you may have applicable education or experience.You will also be asked basic questions about yourself such as your name and address, gender, and age. You'll go through a basic biographical history, including a summary of your marital history, education, and work background., Every application for disability benefits is different, so there are no guarantees as to when you'll hear back on your application. The initial application process could take anywhere from a month to two years., Even if you meet the income or work requirements, you must have been disabled for at least one year before you are eligible for disability benefits for depression.Be wary of notes in your medical records where your doctor says your condition has improved or that you are feeling better. These are points where you may want to ask your doctor for more explanation, so it's understood that your condition is ongoing despite the fact that you had a few good days.Review the treatment recommendations provided by the medical professionals who've worked with you and make sure you've been following their advice, or that you had a legitimate reason for not following it. For example, if your psychiatrist tells you to attend weekly therapy sessions but you are unable to comply with that advice because therapy is expensive and not covered by your insurance, SSA probably would consider that a legitimate reason., You won’t get disability benefits from depression unless you are seeing a medical professional such as a psychologist or a psychiatrist who has diagnosed you with and is treating you for clinical depression.   You must show more than a diagnosis, however. Your doctor must testify regarding the severity of your depression and the ways in which it prevents you from working. The opinion will be stronger if she can provide medical explanations for each event. For example, if you miss work several times in one week because of your depression, go see your doctor and get a report from her on your mental status at that time., The SSA handbook lists disability criteria for affective disorders including depression. These listings are for disabilities that are so severe they automatically warrant benefits without further review.   To meet the criteria for automatic benefits, you have to show medical evidence that proves your symptoms of depression caused at least two of the following: a marked limitation in your ability to perform everyday tasks of living such as getting dressed or bathing yourself, a marked limitation in your ability to relate to others, and a marked limitation in your ability to focus and maintain a regular work pace.A claims examiner associated with SSA determines whether you meet the SSA impairment listing. If you do not, that claims examiner will forward your application to a medical consultant for further review.If you've only seen a social worker or a therapist, understand that the claims examiner who reviews your application will give their opinion less weight than a doctor's opinion. For this reason, you should consider getting another opinion from a psychologist or a psychiatrist before applying for disability.Your doctor's medical opinion should include a psychiatric evaluation with a formal diagnosis, a detailed list of prescribed medications and dosage amounts, and an evaluation of your ability to perform work. If true, your doctor should also make a statement that drug or alcohol dependency were not a factor in your disease. If depression coincides with drug or alcohol dependency, the SSA often uses that as a reason to deny disability benefits., If you don’t qualify under the SSA disability listing for depression, you can still qualify if your residual functional capacity is significantly diminished as an effect of your disability.   At this stage of the process, your disability and treatment history is analyzed by a doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist working as a consultant for SSA. Most disability applicants are approved through a medical-vocational allowance rather than through the disability listings.Your residual functional capacity (RFC) is an analysis of how your depression limits your ability to perform the tasks normally required in a work environment. You would be considered disabled if all of your limitations meant there was no work available that you could reliably do.The medical consultant looks for evidence that your disability causes such a significant restriction of your capacity to function that you are essentially prohibited from working as a result.Once the medical consultant has evaluated your RFC, your file will be returned to a claims examiner, who will evaluate your work history to determine if there are any jobs out there that you could reasonably do, or if your disability truly keeps you from working.The claims examiner will analyze your RFC in light of your age, work experience, and education to make a final determination of whether you are disabled enough to qualify for benefits.Claims examiners make final determinations of disability using a complex system of grid rules that are defined by the age of the applicant. These rules also are subject to a number of exemptions, such as the ""worn out worker"" rule, that grants disability for applicants who've done many years of hard labor and have little to no education., Most applications for disability benefits are denied after the initial application, and this is especially likely if depression is your only disability.   Hiring or consulting with an attorney who specializes in disability will help you understand what sorts of information you need and what you can do to stand a better chance of approval on appeal. Nearly half of all appeals for denial of disability benefits result in benefits being granted on further review, but it takes time., You must file your request for reconsideration within 60 days of receiving the letter denying your application. It is in your best interest to file your appeal as soon as possible.   Reconsideration involves a second review of your application by an SSA employee who hasn't seen it before. Typically you don't need to be present, although you can meet with someone if you want, or if you are having trouble understanding the reasons for your denial.You can file your initial appeal online. If you choose to file a paper form instead, you must also include the disability report form and the disclosure form. Expect to wait three to four months after you file your request to hear back from SSA about your reconsideration., If your claim is denied after being reconsidered, you can request a hearing before an ALJ, an independent government officer outside the SSA.The ALJ's office will let you know the date and time of your hearing, which is typically held within 75 miles of your home.This hearing is more formal, and the ALJ will ask you questions about the information in your application and the documents you've submitted to support your application, including your medical records. You may bring witnesses, including doctors who've treated you and anyone else who has an understanding of your depression and how it effects your life.After the hearing, the ALJ will make a decision based on all the information presented to her before and during the hearing. The SSA will mail you a letter summarizing the decision along with a copy of the ALJ's full decision for your records.The total decision time varies from state to state, but ranges from seven months to nearly two years from the date you request a hearing., If the ALJ doesn’t rule in your favor, you can have his decision reviewed by the Appeals Council.   If you're unsure how to request this review and you don't have an attorney, the SSA will help explain the process and ask for a review. The Appeals Council will review your request and make a preliminary decision whether the ALJ's decision was correct. If the Council finds no fault with the ALJ's decision, it will deny the request for review. You will receive a letter from SSA explaining this decision. If the Appeals Council finds something in your case merits further review, it will either review your case and make a decision itself, or it will return your case to the ALJ who decided it with instructions to correct the problems.Since the Appeals Council is a national body located in Washington, D.C., your presence is not required at their review.If the Appeals Council decides to review your claim, it can take up to a year for them to render their decision., If the Appeals Council affirms the ALJ’s decision, you can file a federal lawsuit.You have 60 days from the date the Appeals Council made its decision to file a civil complaint with your local district court.The SSA can't help you with your federal court case.At this point, if you haven't already done so, you should find an attorney who specializes in Social Security disability to help you with your case. Federal rules of procedure are exceedingly complex and difficult to navigate without experience. When your complaint is filed, the court issues a summons that you must serve on the SSA along with a copy of your complaint. When the SSA has notice of your case, one of the agency's attorneys will file an answer explaining why the agency was correct to deny you benefits.Both you and the SSA will then file briefs with the court that outline your respective positions. Sometimes the court also will schedule an in-person argument.Generally, a federal district court takes about eight months to decide a disability appeal from the date you file suit.",2457,"['degree', 'assets', 'reconsideration', 'alj', 'appeals council', 'lawsuit', 'disability interview', 'ssa', 'requirements', 'administrative law judge', 'enough work credits', 'federal benefit rate', 'statements', 'decision', 'disability benefits', 'hearing', 'work history', 'overall process', 'disability', 'necessary documents', 'benefits', 'medical-vocational allowance', 'income', 'documentation', 'review', 'application', 'household', 'federal district court', 'depression', 'history', 'impairment listing', 'request', 'medical opinions']"
"['review all orientation materials', 'discuss logistics with your parents', 'establish your transportation', 'pack your backpack', 'set out your clothes and toiletries', 'get to bed early', 'wake up early', 'get ready for the day.this is the time for you to get ready for the day with your usual morning routine', 'check that you have everything', 'arrive at your school', 'meet up with your friends', 'request your schedule', 'obtain your identification (id) card', 'obtain your textbooks', 'find your locker', 'find your classrooms', 'talk to fellow students']",How to Survive High School Orientation," It is likely that you received materials from your school regarding orientation. These materials should direct you on where you need to go and what you will need to do.   Thoroughly review any instructions from the school regarding where you need to go and what time. These instructions will save you from being in the wrong place at the wrong time and potentially being embarrassed, as well as missing important information.; , The night before orientation is a great time to review with your parents what is going to happen the next day while you’re at orientation. This is important because you’ll need a thorough understanding of where you need to be and when. You may also need money to pay for certain things, depending on your school and its requirements, so you should discuss that with your parents.   If your parents are required to be involved in orientation, they will need to work that into their schedules and be aware of dates and times. You can start a conversation with your parents by saying, “Can we talk about my orientation tomorrow? I’d like to go over a few things.” If you would like some extra time to walk around the school to find your classrooms, talk to your parents and let them know that you would like an extra hour or so to do this. You can say, “I’d like extra time at orientation to be able to walk around and see my classrooms” to start a conversation with your parents about this.  , Work with your parents or guardians to determine who will pick you up and drop you off or how to use the public transportation in your area, if applicable. Maybe you will even choose to walk or bike to your orientation if you live close enough.   If your parents will be picking you up and dropping you off, work with them to determine what time you need to be there and what time you should be leaving the house to be there on time. Then work to determine how long you will be there and what time they should plan to pick you up. You can ask, “What time should we leave the house in the morning so that I get to orientation on time?” If one of your friends is going to orientation at the same time as you, you can ask if their parents would mind picking you up and/or dropping you off. Your parents and your friend’s parents may even coordinate times that they can pick up and drop off you and your friend. Ask your parents’ permission before doing this. You can also arrange to be with your friend at orientation, which could make it much more fun. If you will be using public transportation, look at bus/train schedules to find out what time you need to be at the bus or train stops. Google Maps will often provide routes via public transportation, which can be very useful and save you time.If you are walking, make sure that you know exactly how to get there. Talk to your parents about which route to take if you are unsure. If you plan to ride your bike, look it over night before. Make sure that the tires have air in them and that your bike is in working order. It would be a good idea to take it for a test ride if it’s not too dark out. If the bike is broken, you will need to repair it yourself, ask a parent to assist you repair it, or take it to a shop.  , It’s a good idea to bring a backpack to orientation because it is likely that you will be bringing home plenty of books and papers.   Make sure to pack any forms that you or your parents filled out. Designate a special folder for these forms so that you don’t lose them in the bottom of your backpack or get them mixed in with other papers. You can ask your parents if they have filled out the necessary forms by posing the question: “Have you filled out the forms for my orientation? I’m getting ready to pack my backpack.” If your high school provided you with a list of things that you’ll need for orientation, review the list and make sure that everything is in your backpack and ready to go. If you need assistance, ask a parent or guardian for help with the task by saying, “Can you please help me make sure that I have everything on my list for orientation?”  , It’s a good idea to have the next day’s outfit picked out and ready to go the night before so that you don’t spend too long deciding what to wear the next morning and end up being late to your orientation.   Pick out your outfit and set it aside on a hanger or neatly folded somewhere in your room. Pick out what shoes you would like to wear and set them near your outfit so that you know where they are and they are ready to go. Decide how you plan to style your hair for orientation. If you need to prepare anything for your hair the night before, you will be able to do so by already deciding how you plan to style your hair. Set out your toiletries in the bathroom or bedroom (depending on your preference). This is a good time to determine which shampoo, conditioner, soap, hair products, makeup (if applicable), and hair brushes you would like to use in the morning and have them ready to go. If you shower at night, make sure that you have the toiletries for your morning routine ready to go in your bedroom and/or bathroom to save time by having to look for things or not knowing what you would like to use.  , It’s a good idea to get plenty of rest the night before orientation so that you are well-rested and ready to face the day. If you have a nightly routine, start it a little earlier than usual and take your time so that you can prepare your mind and body for sleep.   If you have trouble sleeping, a great way to fall asleep is to read while you are in bed. If you are worried about falling asleep quickly, try sipping on a warm drink before you go to bed, such as warm milk or chamomile tea. The warmth of the drink will help you relax. Taking a warm shower or bath before bed can help you fall asleep quickly. This is because the warmth of the shower or bath raises your body temperature and the subsequent cooling effect of stepping out of the shower or bath lowers your body temperature, inducing drowsiness., Waking up early will ensure that you will have plenty of time to get ready and prepare for the day ahead. Waking up early in general can be correlated with better grades.Set your alarm clock an hour earlier than you normally do so that you do not have to rush and can have a relaxing morning routine. Using an alarm clock will help wake you up at the desired time. If you have a phone, you can set an alarm using your iPhone or Android phone. This is generally done by using the default alarm application or downloading a third-party alarm application to use. Avoid hitting the snooze button. It’s an important day and you need to make sure that you are able to leave your house on time and not be late to your orientation.  ,   Eat breakfast. Brush your teeth. Shower, if you choose to. Get dressed with the clothes you set out the night before. Style your hair, if you choose to. Apply makeup, if applicable.  , Before leaving the house, check your backpack to make sure that you have all the required forms, documents, and materials for orientation.  , If you have a schedule, look at it to see where you need to be at the time you have arrived. You may have to wait around for a bit, depending on how early you are.   Follow all directions and listen carefully in the orientation. Take notes if you feel you need to. Remember that you can socialize with friends anytime, but the information you are getting at your orientation is critical to understanding how your school works and what the expectations are for its students.  , If you know that some of your friends are going to orientation at the same time as you, arrange a time and place for you and your friends to meet. This way, you’ll have someone familiar by your side while you are learning about your new school.   Call, text, or message your friends the night before to find out what time they are going to be at their orientation. If they are going at the same time as you, ask if they would like to meet somewhere and go through orientation together. Being with a friend can make orientation much more fun! Remember to pay attention to information being given to you, even though you are with your friends. You don’t want to miss out on anything important.  , If you do not already have your schedule for school, it is likely that you will be receiving it at orientation. Follow the instructions given to you at your orientation to obtain your schedule.   Once you receive your schedule, look it over to make sure that it is correct. If the classes look incorrect, ask a nearby teacher or instructor for help. You can say, “Excuse me, would you mind helping me? It looks like I have the wrong class on my schedule.” Review your schedule carefully to see what time your classes are and what classrooms they are located in. If you are with friends, you can compare your schedule with theirs to see if you share any classes. This can be the most exciting part of receiving your schedule!  , This often involves standing in a line to get your picture taken. You may or may not receive the card the same day that you get the picture taken.   When it is your turn, follow the photographer’s instructions. They may tell you to face your body a certain way or to tilt your head in a certain direction. This is so that the pose in the picture looks consistent with the other students’ pictures and so that your posture looks nice in the photo as well. After the photo is taken, depending on how your school works, you may receive the photo ID a few minutes afterward. If that is the case, you may be directed to stand in line again to receive your ID. After you receive your school ID, be sure to store it in a safe spot in your backpack or wallet.  , If you are receiving your textbooks at orientation, follow the instructions provided to you for getting them. Your school may have a “book room” that holds all of the textbooks. You may have to wait in a long line to receive your textbooks.   When it is your turn, give your name or present your schedule to the teacher or school employee working there. They will retrieve the books for you. When you receive your textbooks, store them in your backpack.  , Once you have your schedule and information about your locker, you can find where it is located and make sure that the combination provided works and that the locker opens.   Look over your locker to see if there is any damage. If there is, report it to a teacher or school employee. Practice opening and closing your locker a few times so that you are familiar with it.  , Once you have your schedule, and you are finished with your orientation activities, walk around the school to find your classrooms. This can be a fun activity to do with your friends.   Obtain a map of the school if you do not know your way around. You can ask teachers or school employees if they have any maps or where you can find one. Once you know the location of your classrooms, try walking to them in the same order as your schedule. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with the routes you will be taking to classes every day.  , If you have time, ask some students what grade they are in (even if you already know) to start a conversation. This is a great way to meet and introduce yourself to new people!   You can start the conversation by saying, “Hi, my name is Sarah. I’m going into 10th grade. What grade are you going into?” After you have started the conversation, you can ask what teachers they have and if they have any favorite teachers. Try talking to at least two or three different people you don’t know. It’s good to step out of your comfort zone and talk to new people. You never know when you will have things in common with them and make a new friend! If your friend’s friends are there and you haven’t met them, try talking to a couple of them and getting to know them more. This is a great way to grow your circle of friends and meet new people, and it doesn’t require you to step out of your comfort zone as much. You can say, “How do you know Michael?” which should start up a conversation and lead to talking about other things.

They don't bog down sentences with extra words and long, winding sections. They cut to the chase and make their point in the simplest language possible. Sometimes it's best to break longer sentences into 2-3 smaller ones.    Original Sentence: ""The philosophy of Existentialism resists descending into the lofty, theoretical arguments that plagued many early philosophies, and thus gains it’s power.""  ""Existentialism became powerful because, unlike earlier, more theoretical philosophies, it is grounded and practical.""    Original Sentence: ""Was the bomb not to ever come to being, America might never have overcome the long, drawn out war in the Pacific.""  ""Who knows how long the US would have had to fight in the Pacific without the bomb.""    Original Sentence: ""Wandering in the desolate wilderness, Dave sat on a dusty, crepuscular rock and thought about his past while drinking from his almost empty canteen.""  ""Tired of aimless wandering, Dave sat on a dusty boulder to rest. He opened his canteen, but there were only a few drops left. Tired and thirsty, his mind drifted to his past.""    , People are visual animals - we see things when we read and orient ourselves with images. Give your reader enough specifics to visualize your writing whether you're writing stories, scripts, or speeches. Use 1-2 powerful images or senses to put the reader in your scene, paragraph, or shoes.   I felt tired → ""My arms and muscles trembled, and my eyelids fluttered shut no matter how hard I tried to stay awake.""Gina is a nice woman. → ""Gina was the kind of woman who baked you a plate of cookies (hot, gooey, smelling like home), just because you said you had a rough day."" To him, the city was terrible. → ""He couldn't stand the city - the endless lights, the clatter of cars and pavement, the way all eyes turned downward when you looked at them as if you were the ugliest man in Manhattan and not just another stranger.""  , Comparing two things, either with a metaphor, simile, or direct comparison, helps your reader make connections and deepens your writing. It gives them something to hold onto that they already understand, which helps them understand your writing. You can even make connections to your own stories, like in the third example here:""In many ways he was like America itself, big and strong, full of good intentions, a roll of fat jiggling at his belly, slow of foot but always plodding along, always there when you needed him, a believer in the virtues of simplicity and directness and hard labor"" (The Things They Carried, Tim O'Brien). ""Like the waters of the river, like the motorists on the highway, and like the yellow trains streaking down the Santa Fe tracks, drama, in the shape of exceptional happenings, had never stopped there"" (In Cold Blood, Truman Capote). ""Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice"" (One-Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez). “For poems are like rainbows; they escape you quickly"" (The Big Sea, Langston Hughes).  , Adverbs, the words that end in -ly and modify actions, are the bane of many great writers. They give a sing-song feel to writing and bog down the meaning of a sentence in useless little modifications. Notice how, in most cases, the adverbs and filler words (like ""really"" or ""very"") don't add a lot to the sentences.   ""Jaime was really sorry, and ran quickly over to his friend's house just to apologize."" ""What's up?"" She asked, happily. ""Nothing much,"" he answered tiredly.She picked her face absently and said, ""I wanted to talk about something."" ""I don't have time,"" he responded curtly.   , Great paragraphs should be self-contained. They have a beginning, middle, and end. Otherwise, they don't actually move the story or essay along. Thought of another way, every paragraph and scene should end in a different place than where it started.Ernest Hemingway was the master of economy. It is hard to find an extra paragraph or scene in any of his short stories or books. Everything adds up.  Great journalism is a good way to see how each smaller part pushes the story forward. Read your favorite newspaper, but stop after every paragraph -- what did it accomplish? Though not strictly a paragraph, Shakespearean monologues are a masterclass in growth and power in a short span. Listen to Hamlet's famous first monologue -- note how different he is in beginning and end.  , Sometimes, the best way to get your point across is a long, winding sentence that packs in a multitude of meaning. Occasionally, you really do need adverbs and silly filler words to make a point perfectly. A direct point can be better than an indirect comparison. Sometimes a paragraph is there to provide tone, to slow down the pacing, or pause on a beautiful description, even if it ""accomplishes"" nothing., You may prefer to write a new short scene every day, or work on a long-term, writing project. You might have a daily minimum of one paragraph, or an entire page. But if you take any advice from this page, stick to one important habit: write every single day.   If you can't find room in your schedule, try getting up early or going to bed late, even if you can only spare fifteen minutes.  , Don't be so afraid to write something ""bad"" that you end up staring at a blank document.Getting anything on the page at all can help you get started. Write about how you're stuck and can't think of something to write, or describe an object in the room in painfully exhaustive detail, or rant about something that irritates you. A few minutes of this will often put you in ""writing mode"" and lead you to another idea.   Look online, in bookstores, or in libraries for collections of writing prompts. These are designed to give you a starting point to work from, and are often ridiculous to spark your imagination and get you started.  , If you've been writing for a while, chances are good that you keep getting drawn back to a particular style, topic, or format. Practicing a favorite type of writing is a great way to keep yourself motivated, but make an effort to vary your writing exercises once in a while. Deliberately tackling new and difficult challenges is vital for improvement in any field.Try these challenges as exercises, whether or not you're interested in polishing the end result:   If your writing projects or your narrators all sound similar, try a different style. Imitate another author, or combine the styles of two authors.If most of your writing is for a blog, or for one long project, take a break from it. Think of a topic that could never fit into your usual writing project, and write about it. (For a followup challenge, rewrite the piece so it could fit into your project.)  , Invite feedback on your writing, and offer to read other writers' drafts. Welcome honest criticism offered as advice for improvement, but keep your writing away from friends who act dismissive or negative.There's a big difference between useful critique, and disheartening negativity.   Look for online communities such as Scribophile or WritersCafe, or search for a more niche community on a specific type of writing. Check your local library and community centers for information on local writing clubs. You could even practice writing on a wiki, such as wikiHow or Wikipedia. This lets you help people as you practice, and might be one of the largest communal writing projects you ever undertake.  , If you have trouble getting around to your writing projects, make a commitment to other people to give yourself external motivation. Get a pen pal to write letters to on a regular schedule, or start a blog with weekly updates. Find a writing contest a few weeks in the future, and promise to submit an entry. Join a writing challenge, whether that's a single writing session with a group of friends, or NaNoWriMo's annual ""novel in a month"" extravaganza.  , The first draft of a story always has room for improvement, and often ends up looking quite different after a few revisions.Once you've written a piece that attracts your attention, go through the ""finished"" piece of writing and find sentences, paragraphs, or whole pages you're dissatisfied with. Rewrite a scene from a different character's perspective, try out alternative plot developments, or change the order of events. If you're not sure why you dislike a passage, rewrite it without referring to the original, then see what you like best in each version.   Scrapping a beloved passage and starting again can be incredibly tough, so much so that writers have been phrasing this advice as ""murder your darlings"" for over a century., Writers have a passion for the written word, and there's no better way to stoke that passion than to read. Read as widely as possible, from magazines to young adult novels to history dissertations, although you don't need to feel pressure to finish everything you pick up.Reading builds vocabulary, teaches grammar, provides inspiration, and shows you what can be done with language. For the beginning writer, reading may be just as important as the actual writing.If you're not sure what to read, ask for recommendations from friends, or visit a library and pick a couple books from each section.  , While you're reading, keep a dictionary and thesaurus on hand, or write down unfamiliar words to look up later. World class writers have argued over whether to use simple words, or employ sesquipedalian verbiage. That's something for you to decide in your own writing, but not before you learn which tools are available.   Dictionary definitions often don't provide an intuitive sense of how to use a word. Search for the word online and read it in context to get a better understanding.  , Sure, there are plenty of famous, excellent books written in non-standard grammar, but learning grammar isn't just about memorizing a set of rules. Studying how a sentence is put together, and how punctuation is used to structure it, gives you the knowledge you need to express yourself the way you intend. If you think this may be a weak point for you, study an English textbook, or find a writing tutor.    Learn how to write without informal grammar if you are not used to formal, written English. If you have a question about grammar, refer to a grammar book, such as The American Heritage Book of English Usage.  , Just as you change your clothing for the weather and the occasion, you should also change your writing for your audience and your message. Flowery writing, for example, might fit better in a poem than in a status report. Make sure that your word choice and sentence length is not too difficult (or too simplistic) for your audience, if you are addressing a specific group. Avoid specialized jargon when speaking to someone unfamiliar with the topic.  , While thinking about what to write, put down any idea that comes to you, even if it seems far-fetched or unlikely to be successful. One mediocre idea may lead to a better one.  , Find a topic that grabs your attention and thrills you. Your excitement and interest will make it easier for you to keep the project going and keep it to a high standard, and hopefully it will rub off on the reader as well.  , A serious writing project doesn't need to be a full-length book. Crafting a short story can be a difficult and rewarding challenge, and may be a more time-effective way to practice your skills.  , Keep a notebook for writing down observations, overheard conversations, and sudden ideas encountered in your daily life. When you read or hear something that makes you laugh, think, or want to repeat it to someone else, write it down and think about what makes it effective.   You may use this notebook to write down unfamiliar words as well.  , Use whatever technique works best for you, or try out several if you don't have an established process yet. You can make an outline, put a collection of notes on cards and arrange them until they are in order, or draw a tree or map. Your outline may have nothing but a rough order of the events or topics covered, or it may be a more detailed scene-by-scene summary. Building some kind of structure in advance can help keep you going on days when you're feeling low on creativity.There are many types of organizational software for writers, such as Scrivener or TheSage. It's fine to deviate from your plan, but if you abandon it entirely, stop and consider the reasons behind the chance. Build a new plan to guide you through the altered work, and keep you thinking consciously about how you want to get through it.  , While a work of nonfiction requires you to know your subject, even a fiction book will benefit from research. If your main character is a glassblower, read a book on glassblowing and use the right terminology. If you are writing a book set before you were born, interview people who lived during that time, or who spoke to parents and grandparents who did.   In the case of fiction writing, you may be able to dive in to the first draft before you start your research.  , Try writing without pause for as long as you can. Do not stop to change your word choice or correct your grammar, spelling, or punctuation. This is one of the most common recommendations for making sure that you actually finish what you start.  , Once you have a first draft, reread it and rewrite it. You are looking for errors in grammar and spelling as well as style, content, organization, and coherence. If there are any passages you dislike, get rid of them and write them again from scratch. Critiquing your own work is an important skill, and it takes plenty of practice, just like writing itself..   Give yourself time between writing and editing, if at all possible. It is better to wait a good length of time, but even a short break can give you some of the necessary distance and detachment to edit well.  , Get feedback on your work in progress from interested readers, whether they are friends, fellow writers, or readers of your writing blog. Try to accept criticism without getting angry or upset; even if you don't agree with the specifics, knowing what parts of your work people dislike can be valuable for focusing your editing.  , Don't be afraid to make drastic changes, even cutting whole sections of the project or rewriting it from a different character's perspective. Continue the cycle of feedback and editing as you explore how to perfect your work. If it feels like running in place, remember you are practicing skills that will help you in all your future writing. You can always take a break to write something fun and ridiculous, just to remind yourself that writing can be a blast.

Writing this speech is going to be a process and brainstorming is an important part of that process. Additionally, it is helpful to verbally brainstorm with your family and friends about what to write. However, once you start the writing process, it is a much more effective to brainstorm through writing. Once you have ideas from talking to your friends or family or thinking about what you want to say start writing down experiences that match those ideas. For example, if you were driving toward the theme that David Foster Wallace used of learning how to think instead of what to think. You might have brainstorm about a time that you decided to learn how to knit to make all of your friends and family gifts for Christmas instead of buying them gifts. Talk about how much your grandmother loved the scarf you made her and how that ended up bonding you two together. When you think back to why you care so much about making gifts instead of buying them you realize that you want to question the pressure that is put on you to spend a lot of money to buy everyone Christmas presents. That is your theme.  , Think about what you want your message to your audience to be, and write it down in one sentence. If you know what your message is, you will be able to write a more effective speech. Starting from your main idea and developing a speech from there will save you a lot of time and rewriting.   For example, I want to talk about how giving your time to volunteer work will end up making you a happier and healthier person. Write out your most important life experiences and lessons learned, and decide what a main take away from those stories/lessons could be. For example, after working at the soup kitchen every weekend during my senior year, I learned life lessons from people I never expected to learn from. Homeless people who I saw freely give others some of their prized possessions ended up teaching me how to give freely. Some examples of common themes in graduation speeches are: believing in/liking yourself, taking risks/putting yourself out there, failing is necessary for success, giving back helps you as an individual, being persistent pays off, being okay with not being perfect, overcoming adversity, good friendships save, and there are different paths to take through life/there is no one right answer. Giving thanks and congratulations is another style of graduation speech you can choose to write. In these graduation speeches individuals talk about all that they have come through as a class to get to graduation. They also might take more time to talk about and thank the individuals who helped them along the way. These speeches tend to be less focused on giving advice and the individual giving the speech and more focused on the group as a whole. Listed here is a wikiHow article on writing a graduation thank you speech. , If you are having a hard time getting started, research good graduation speeches and start taking notes on the way they show their main ideas. Do not become intimidated by these great speeches, instead let them inspire you to write about something you really care about.   See if you can pick out a few main themes in the graduation speech, usually it will not be very difficult to find because it will be repeated several times. Writing those down will help you see how they craft their speech around those ideas. For example, you could take note that David Foster Wallace uses a simple metaphor to get across his main idea. He uses the metaphor of a fish being aware that he is in water as compared to a person who realizes that he is in a society that influences us to think and act. This metaphor shows us how important it is to be aware of the obvious realities of being in society that others might miss. It also how shows us how isolating it can be to be aware. #*Likewise, think about using a similar convention, for example, a short joke or a metaphor that illustrates your main point.  , Below are a few common graduation speech structures that have have been used with success many times. Consider using any of the following speech structures that have been used successfully by many others. In the first speech structure, you highlight a few, typically one to four, main take-aways, or themes. You show address those ideas through personal anecdotes or nonfiction stories to impart some wisdom to the graduating class. The people who choose this structure generally feel that they have simple, yet important wisdom that might help the graduates succeed in life. For example, Steve Jobs used this structure and told just three stories about his life. The first story he told was about how he “connected the dots” in his life. In the second structure, make a list of five to ten tips that you have acquired that you give as advice to the graduating class. If you had trouble honing in on one to three themes or take-aways, this might be a good option for you. You can highlight important things that are both big and small in this kind of speech. For example, an admiral gave a speech about the ten essential life tips he learned from the Navy that including tips to both make your bed, and never, ever give up. In the third, you tell a condensed version of your life story. Go for this option if you feel like you have a very powerful personal story that illustrates some important ideas about how to be successful or how to overcome adversity. You don’t have to start with the beginning of your life, instead talk about the important things that have made you who you are. For example, music producer Jimmy Iovine used this structure and started his speech by talking about a rebuke John Landau gave him. Jon said, ¨this is not about you¨, and that advise gave Jimmy the courage to keep working when his ego was fed up. In the last speech structure, you develop one main idea as an argument and use observations from life, your personal history, etc., to support this main idea. This option is good if you are really passionate about conveying one central idea to your audience that you are entirely convinced needs to be be heard by everyone. This is perhaps the most difficult speech to write because it is much like writing an argument; your ideas need to be logical and well organized. For example, David Foster Wallace follows this structure. He makes a claim that the real value of education isn’t learning what to think but gaining the freedom to choose how to think. He stays with this theme and develops his ideas like an argument. , This means that the way you write or tell stories matches your style. Showing your personality will help your audience relate to you and will help you feel more like yourself while giving the speech.   You can use humor to convey your personality. For example, Sumner Redstone, giving a speech to DeVry University, starts his speech with some self-deprecating humor that points out that people won't enjoy sitting through his speech. Redstone says that he is glad to go first in the program, and he quotes Mark Twain who recommends swallowing a frog at the start of the day to get the worst thing out of the way. Here Redstone makes himself the toad to make his audience laugh.  , Believing in what you are saying is essential to giving a good speech, don’t be afraid of writing a simple speech so long as you believe what you are saying. For example, Joan Didonato wrote her speech about ¨four little observations¨, and her first observation was as simple as ¨commit to the journey¨. Being passionate about what you are talking about will show in your delivery, as long as you practice. Speeches involve much more than the words you say, and oftentimes much more can be said through the emotions you convey when you deliver your speech. Think about all of the ways you can put emotion into a simple phrase like ¨I would die for you."" A lot of meaning balances on the way you say those words. Practice putting emotion into your speech to give it meaning. Rehearse what you will say in front of a mirror several times to see how you look, and don't be afraid to use gestures.  , This is a graduation ceremony, and everyone will be excited to be graduating. Depending on the tone of your speech, you can use this excitement to your advantage by throwing in references that the audience will cheer for.   Because everyone has gone through a lot to get to this point, you may want to take a minute to genuinely congratulate them on their accomplishments.  , Cliches may be true but they are also probably uninteresting to your audience. There are many graduation speech cliches: the future is yours, today is your day, discussing unemployment rates, and talking about how much the world has changed because of globalization and technology.   You should avoid these cliches because they have been overused, and the people in your audience will most likely not be inspired by these topics. Do not confuse universal themes for cliches. Some of the best, most powerful speeches have very simple messages. For example, giving back helps you grow as an individual. Even though this theme that has been explored before and will be explored again, the theme still rings true and bears repeating.

Accepting that you have negative thoughts and feelings, and that you don’t enjoy how you’re currently responding to them, can help you begin the process of change.Try not to judge yourself for your thoughts or feelings. Remember: the thoughts that pop up or the feelings you experience are not inherently “good” or “bad,” they’re just thoughts and feelings. What you can control is how you interpret and respond to them. Accept the things about yourself that you can’t change, too. For example, if you’re an introverted person who needs quiet time alone to “recharge,” trying to be an extrovert all the time will probably just make you feel drained and unhappy. Accept yourself for who you are right now, just as you are. You can then feel free to develop that self into the most positive self you can be!; , Goals give us a more positive outlook on life. Research has shown that setting a goal can make you feel immediately more confident and hopeful, even if you don’t achieve the goal right away.Setting goals that are personally meaningful to you and align with your values will help you achieve them and move forward in your life.Start small with your goals. Don't shoot for the moon right away. Slow and steady wins the race. Make your goals specific. The goal “be more positive” is great, but it’s so huge you probably won’t have any idea how to start. Instead, set smaller specific goals, like “Meditate twice a week” or “Smile at a stranger once a day.”Word your goals positively. Research shows that you’re more likely to achieve your goals if you word them positively. In other words, make your goals something you’re working toward, not trying to avoid. For example: “Stop eating junk food” is an unhelpful goal. It can cause feelings of shame or guilt. “Eat 3 servings of fruit and vegetables each day” is specific and positive.Keep your goals based on your own actions. Remember that you can’t control anyone else. If you set goals that require a certain response from others, you may end up feeling down if things don’t go as you hoped. Instead, set goals that depend on what you can control -- your own performance., Also known as metta bhavana or “compassion meditation,” this type of meditation has roots in Buddhist traditions.It teaches you to extend the feelings of love you already feel for your closest family members and extend it to others in the world. It’s also been shown to improve your resilience -- your ability to bounce back from negative experiences -- and your relationships with others in just a few weeks.You can see positive effects in as little as five minutes a day.Many places offer courses in compassion meditation. You can also check out some guided MP3 meditations online. The Center for Contemplative Mind in Societyand the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Centerboth have free downloadable loving-kindness meditations. It turns out that loving-kindness meditation is also good for your mental health. Studies have shown that compassion meditation decreases symptoms of depression, suggesting that learning compassion for others may also help you extend compassion to yourself., Recent research suggests there’s actually a mathematical formula for positivity: three positive emotions for every negative emotion seems to keep you in a healthy balance.Keeping a journal can help you see all of the emotional experiences in your day and determine where your own ratio needs adjustment. It can also help you focus on your positive experiences so that you’re more likely to remember them for later.Keeping a journal should be more than just a list of things you didn’t like. Research suggests that focusing only on the negative emotions and experiences in your journal will reinforce them, leading you to feel more negative.Instead, write down what you felt, without judging it as either good or bad. For example, a negative experience might look like this: “I felt hurt today when my coworker made a joke about my weight.” Then, think about your response. How did you respond in the moment? How would you choose to respond now, with a little distance? For example: “In the moment, I felt horrible about myself, like I was worthless. Now thinking back on it, I realize that my coworker says insensitive things to everyone. Someone else can’t define me or my worth. Only I can do that.” Try to think about how you can use these experiences as learning experiences. How can you use this for personal growth? What will you do next time? For example: “Next time someone says something hurtful, I will remember that their judgments do not define me. I will also tell my coworker that his comments are insensitive and hurt my feelings so that I remember my feelings are important.” Remember to include the positive things in your journal too! Taking even a few moments to note down a kindness from a stranger, a beautiful sunset, or an enjoyable chat with a friend will help you “store” these memories so that you can recall them later. Unless you focus on them, they’re likely to pass right by your notice.  , Gratitude is more than a feeling, it’s a doing. Dozens of studies have shown that gratitude is good for you.It changes your perspective almost immediately, and the rewards keep growing the more you practice.Gratitude helps you feel more positive, enhances your relationships with others, encourages compassion, and increases feelings of happiness.Some people are naturally higher in “trait gratitude,” the natural state of feeling thankful. However, you can foster an “attitude of gratitude” no matter what level of “trait gratitude” you naturally have!In relationships and situations, avoid approaching them like you “deserve” something from them. This doesn’t mean that you believe you deserve nothing, and it doesn’t mean you put up with mistreatment or disrespect. It just means that you should try to approach things without feeling like you’re “entitled” to a certain result, action, or benefit.Share your gratitude with others. Sharing your feelings of gratitude with others helps you “set” those feelings in your memory. It can also inspire positive feelings in the people you share with.See if you have a friend who’ll be your “gratitude partner” and share three things for which you’re grateful with each other every day.Make an effort to recognize all the little positive things that happen throughout the day. Write them down in a journal, snap photos for your Instagram, write about them on Twitter -- whatever helps you recognize and remember these small things for which you’re grateful. For example, if your blueberry pancakes turned out just right, or the traffic to work wasn’t bad, or your friend gave you a compliment on your outfit, note these things! They add up quickly.Savor these good things. Humans have a bad tendency to focus on the negative stuff and let the positive things slide right past us. When you note the positive things in your life, take a moment to mindfully acknowledge them. Try to “store them” in your memory. For example, if you see a beautiful flower garden on your daily walk, stop for a moment and tell yourself, “This is a beautiful moment, and I want to remember how grateful I feel for it.” Try to take a mental “snapshot” of the moment. Doing so can help you remember these things later, when you’re having a hard time or a negative experience., Self-affirmations may seem a little cheesy, but research suggests that they work on a fundamental level; they can actually form new “positive thought” neuron clusters. Remember: your brain likes to use short-cuts, and it will short-cut to use the pathways that are used most frequently. If you make it a regular habit to say compassionate things to yourself, your brain will come to see that as the “norm.”Positive self-talk and self-affirmations can also reduce stress and depression, boost your immune system, and increase your coping skills.Choose affirmations that are personally meaningful to you. You might choose to use affirmations that show compassion to your body, to your thoughts about yourself, or to remind yourself of your spiritual traditions. Whatever makes you feel positive and tranquil about yourself, do it! For example, you might say something like “My body is healthy and my mind is beautiful” or “Today I will do my best to be kind” or “Today my deity/spiritual figure is with me as I go through the day.” If you struggle with a particular area, try actively focusing on finding positive affirmations in that area. For example, if you have body image issues, try saying something like, “I am beautiful and strong” or “I can learn to love myself as I love others” or “I am worthy of love and respect.”  , Researchers in the 1970s discovered that among people who had won the lottery -- an event that most of us probably think of as incredibly positive -- were no happier after a year than people who hadn’t. This is because of hedonic adaptation: humans have a “baseline” of happiness to which we return after external events (good or bad).However, even if your natural baseline is pretty low, you can actively cultivate optimism. Optimism improves your self-esteem, overall sense of well-being, and relationships with others.Optimism is a way of interpreting the world. Thanks to the human brain’s flexibility, you can learn different ways of interpreting!Pessimistic outlooks view the world in unchangeable, internalized terms: “Everything is unfair,” “I’ll never be able to change this,” “My life sucks and it’s my fault.” An optimistic outlook views the world in flexible, limited terms.For example, a pessimistic outlook might look at the big cello recital you have next week and say, “I already suck at cello. I’m going to botch the recital anyway. I might as well just play Nintendo.” This statement makes an assumption that your cello skills are innate and permanent, rather than something you can influence with hard work. It also makes a global blaming statement about you -- “I suck at cello” -- that makes it seem like your cello skills are a personal failing, rather than a skill that needs practice. This pessimistic outlook could mean you don’t practice the cello because you feel like it’s pointless, or you feel guilty because you’re “bad” at something. Neither is helpful. An optimistic outlook would approach this situation something like this: “That big cello recital is next week, and I’m not happy with where I’m at right now. I’m going to practice an extra hour every day until the recital, and then just do my best. That’s all I can do, but at least I’ll know I worked as hard as I could to succeed.” Optimism doesn’t say challenges and negative experiences don’t exist. It chooses to interpret them differently. There’s a big difference between true optimism and “blind” optimism. Blind optimism might expect that you pick up the cello for the first time and get admitted to the Juilliard School. This isn’t realistic, and such expectations could leave you disappointed. True optimism acknowledges the reality of your situation and allows you to prepare yourself to face them. A truly optimistic perspective might instead expect that you’ll need to work hard for several years and even then you might not be admitted to your dream school, but you will have done all that you can to achieve your goal., One of the mistakes people make is trying to avoid or ignore negative experiences. This makes sense, on some level, because they’re painful. However, trying to repress or ignore these experiences actually damages your ability to deal with them.Instead, consider how you can reframe these experiences. Can you learn from them? Can you view them differently?   For example, consider inventor Myshkin Ingawale. In a 2012 TED Talk, Ingawale told the story about how he invented technology to save pregnant women’s lives in rural India. The first 32 times he tried to invent his device, it didn’t work. Again and again, he was faced with the opportunity to interpret his experience as failure and give up. However, he chose to use these experiences to learn from past challenges, and now his invention has helped reduce deaths of pregnant women in rural India by 50%.As another example, consider Dr. Viktor Frankl, who was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp during the Holocaust. Despite being faced with the worst of humanity, Dr. Frankl chose to interpret his situation on his own terms, writing that “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”Instead of letting yourself immediately respond to a challenge or negative experience with negativity, take a step back and examine the situation. What really went wrong? What is really at stake? What can you learn from this to do differently next time? Has this experience taught you to be kinder, more generous, wiser, stronger? Taking a moment to reflect on the experience, rather than automatically seeing it as negative, will help you re-interpret it.  , Your body and your mind are intimately connected. If you’re struggling to feel positive, it could be because your body is working against you. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy has shown that your posture can even affect the levels of stress hormones in your body.Try standing up straight. Hold your shoulders back and your chest forward. Hold your gaze in front of you. Take up space. This is called a “power pose,” and it can actually help you feel more confident and optimistic.Smile. Research suggests that when you smile -- whether you “feel” happy or not -- your brain elevates your mood.This is particularly true if you use a duchenne smile, which activates the muscles around your eyes as well as your mouth. People who smiled during painful medical procedures even reported less pain than people who didn’t.Dress in a way that expresses yourself. What you wear affects how you feel. One study showed that people who wore lab coats while performing a simple scientific task performed much better than people who didn’t wear lab coats -- even though the coat was the only difference!Find clothes that make you feel good about yourself and wear them, no matter what society tries to say about it. And don’t get hung up on investing your size with any meaning: clothing sizes are completely arbitrary, and one store’s size 4 is another store’s size 12.Remember, no random number determines your worth!  , When you exercise, your body releases powerful endorphins, the body’s natural “feel-good” chemicals.Exercise can help fight feelings of anxiety and depression. Studies have also shown that regular, moderate exercise increases your feelings of calmness and well-being.Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day.You don’t have to be a bodybuilder to get the effects of exercise, either. Even moderate exercises like jogging, swimming, or gardening can help you feel more positive overall. Exercises that include meditation, such as yoga and tai chi, can also help you feel more positive and increase your overall health., If you want more success, focus on all the ways that you are already successful. If you want more love, focus on all the people that already care about you and the abundance of love you have to give to others. If you want to create greater health, focus on all the ways that you are healthy, and so on and so forth.  , Everyone in life is confronted with things that seem important at the time but aren't really an issue if we step back and have proper perspective. Research has shown that those material things that may be getting you down won’t actually make you happy.In fact, focusing on things is often a way to make up for other needs that aren’t fulfilled.Research suggests that we need five basic things to flourish in life:Positive emotions Engagement (getting really involved or swept up in something) Relationships with others Meaning Accomplishment Remember that you can define what these things mean for yourself! Don’t get hung up on what others have defined as “meaning” or “accomplishment.” If you don’t find personal meaning in what you do and how you act, you won’t feel good about it. Material objects, fame, and money really won’t make you happy.  , Our activity and thoughts are positive or negative like magnets. As we avoid dealing with a problem, then it continues as it is — or gets worse. Our own negativity rules the day. But, the more we think positively, the more proactively we will act and reach goals and ways to overcome and accept positive options — and these will bring their rewards. In fact, positive thoughts can even boost your immune system!, It sounds simple, but it's hard to execute sometimes. Your life may be very busy, so carve some tasks into your day that consistently make you happy. When you do something that you love, you are distracted from being sad or negative. Some positive activities that you can do are:    Listening to music. Listen to the genre you like. Reading. Reading is good for you. It can even teach you empathy.And, if you’re reading non-fiction, it can help you learn new information and perspectives on the world. Creative expression, e.g. painting, writing, origami, etc. Sports, hobbies, etc. Being with friends and family. The awe-inspiring. Studies show that the feeling of awe or wonderment you experience when you’re walking in nature, viewing a stunning painting, or listening to your favorite symphony is great for your health, both physically and mentally. Find ways to incorporate a little wonder into your life whenever you can., Appreciate the people in your life who have stood by you through thick and thin. Enlist their support to help you become more positive, and in the process you will probably help them too. Friends help each other through both the good and bad times.Studies have shown that people who surround themselves with friends who have similar values and outlooks are more likely to feel happy and positive about their lives than people who don’t.Interacting with people you love causes your brain to release neurotransmitters that make you feel happy (dopamine) and relaxed (serotonin). Spending time with friends and loved ones will actually make you feel more positive on a chemical level!You can also encourage your friends and loved ones to become your gratitude partners. If you foster a network of sharing things you’re grateful for, imagine the positivity that you can help each other develop!  , Compassion is doing something kind for someone else, especially if that person is less privileged than you are. It can really boost your positivity. For example, research has shown that when people give to charity, they actually feel as happy as they do when they get money themselves!Think of ways that you can serve others, whether it’s on an individual level or in your community, and practice showing compassion. Not only is it good for others, it’s even good for your health!Like leads to like. If we do something nice for someone else, especially if it's unexpected, there's a higher chance that person will pay the favor back, maybe not directly to us, but to someone else. Eventually, in a direct or indirect way, it'll make its way back to us. Some people call this karma. Whatever it’s called, scientific studies have shown that the “pay it forward” principle is a real thing.Try tutoring, volunteering, or ask your church how you can get involved. Make a microloan to someone in need. A microloan of even a few dollars to a person in a developing country can help her grow her business or become economically independent. And most microloans have 95+ repayment rates, too.Try giving little gifts to people around you, even strangers. Buy a random person in line a cup of coffee. Send a friend something you made with him in mind. Giving gifts stimulates the production of dopamine in your brain -- in fact, you may even get a bigger “happiness rush” from it than the person getting the gift!, When you're a little unsure or feeling like a pick-me-up, check it for a quick reference. Here are some famous quotes you might start off with:How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world. ― Anne Frank The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds; and the pessimist fears this is true. ― James Branch Cabell The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude. ― Oprah Winfrey If you hear a voice within you say “you cannot paint,” then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced. ― Vincent Van Gogh  , A common misperception is that people only “need” to see a counselor or therapist when there’s something “wrong.” But consider: you go to the dentist for cleanings, even when you don’t have cavities. You go to the doctor for annual checkups, even if you’re not sick. Seeing a therapist can also be a helpful “preventive” technique.And if you want to learn how to think and behave more positively, a therapist or counselor can help you identify unhelpful patterns in your thinking and develop new, positive strategies.You can ask your physician for a referral, or check out directories online. If you have health insurance, your provider can tell you about counselors in your network. Low-cost options often exist. Check online for mental health clinics, community health centers, even public-service counseling centers run by colleges and universities.  , Humans are highly susceptible to “emotional contagion,” meaning that the feelings of those around us influence our own.Steer clear of bad behavior and negativity so that it will not rub off on you.   Choose your friends wisely. The friends we surround ourselves with can have an overwhelming impact on our outlooks — both good and bad. If your friends are always being negative, consider sharing your own positivity process with them. Encourage them to learn ways of being positive, too. If they’re still bent on staying negative, you may need to detach from them for your own sake. Do only what you feel comfortable with. If you don't feel comfortable doing something, you're likely to feel bad, guilty, or concerned about doing it. That doesn't make for a positive experience. Learning to say ""no"" to things you don't want to do can help you feel stronger and more at ease with yourself.This is true with friends and loved ones and in work situations., It’s easy to get swept up into a pattern of “automatic” or habitual negative thinking, especially about ourselves. We can become our own harshest critics. Each time you encounter a negative thought, take the time to challenge it.Try to turn it into a positive thought, or find the logical flaw in the negative thought. If you do this long enough, it will become habitual, and it'll make a tremendous difference in improving your positive thinking skills. Say ""I can!"" more than ""I can't!"" Remember, everything can be framed positively; make a relentless effort to do so.For example, if you get angry and snap at a friend, your instinct might be to think, “I’m a horrible person.” This is a cognitive distortion: it makes a general statement about a specific incident. It creates feelings of guilt but not anything that you can use to learn from. Instead, accept responsibility for your action and consider what you should do in response. For example: “I snapped at my friend, which probably hurt her feelings. I was wrong. I will apologize to her, and next time, I will ask to take a little break when we’re discussing something intense.” This way of thinking doesn’t generalize yourself as “horrible,” but as a person who made a mistake and can learn and grow from it. If you find that you frequently have negative thoughts about yourself (or others), make it a habit to find three positive things to say about yourself for every negative one. For example, if the thought shows up that you’re “stupid,” challenge that thought with three positive ones: “I’m having the thought that I’m stupid. But just last week I finished that big project to rave reviews. I have solved difficult problems in the past. I am a capable person and am just having a hard time right now.” Even when we don't get what we want, we gain valuable experience. Experiences are often much more valuable than material things. Material things slowly waste away; experiences stay with us, growing, our entire lives. There are both positive and negative aspects to most situations. We get to choose which ones we will focus on. We can try to catch ourselves when we're being negative and try thinking the opposite. There's no sense in worrying about the negatives if they cannot be changed. Some parts of life are ""unfair."" That's because life just ""is."" If we waste energy and happiness on the things we can't change, we'll only make ourselves more frustrated.  , If you find yourself feeling consistently unhappy, upset, or negative, you may have some underlying issues that need to be dealt with. Seek professional help in dealing with traumas, such as past abuse, exposure to stresses, natural disasters, grief, and loss.Look for a licensed mental health professional, particularly one who specializes in treating trauma if you can find one. Working through your traumas with a counselor or therapist can be difficult, even painful, but you will emerge stronger and more positive at the end., To paraphrase Franklin D. Roosevelt, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. We will fall down and make mistakes. It's about how we get back up again that counts. If we're expecting to succeed, but not afraid of failure, we have the best chance of staying positive throughout it all.

Try to think of food as the fuel and energy for your body instead of something you need to avoid or restrict to lose weight.   Food is something your body needs. It provides you with the energy and nutrients to fuel you through the day and nourish you from the inside out.Try to keep this in mind when you're dieting. Overly restricting foods or thinking foods are ""bad"" or ""unhealthy"" can lead to negative thoughts about your diet or what you choose to eat. All foods are good in moderation. However, focus on nutrient dense foods to provide your body with the most nutrition. Think about all the great vitamins, minerals or antioxidants that your body is getting every time you choose a nutritious food like fruits, vegetables or whole grains.; , Diet plans or diet foods are not always the tastiest or the most satisfying. That's why many people ditch their diets and go back to their typical way of eating.   Choosing foods that you actually enjoy and that are nutritious is the best bet when you're trying to lose weight. If you don't like your diet or the foods you're choosing for your diet, you won't stick to it very long. Diets don't have to be boring or tasteless. Choose flavorful, creative, enjoyable foods and recipes for your weight loss plan.  , Many times, extra weight gain is caused by emotional or stress eating. When you're not aware of when or how often you're doing this, it can cause some stumbling blocks to your long-term weight goal.   Emotional or stress eating is when you snack, graze or over eat when you're not truly physically hungry. It's fueled by some emotion like stress, anger, depression, boredom, sadness and loneliness.If you're not experiencing physical hunger when the desire to eat or food craving hits, think about why you have the urge to eat. Did you have a stressful day? Is there an on-going stressful situation at home? Are you bored? These types of questions can help you figure out why you're eating. If you think you're having difficulty with emotional eating, consider seeing a behavioral therapist for additional help.  , Extreme exercising means that you're working out for an excessive amount of time or at excessively high intensities. Although you may think this works to your benefit, this is also considered an unsafe method of weight loss.   Exercise at this level may lead to injury and an inability to eat enough to support a high level of exercise. A recent study showed that extreme exercise has been linked to higher levels of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries.In addition, extreme exercising, especially after a large or high calorie meal may be considered exercise bulimia where you're using exercise to ""purge"" your body of the calories you've consumed.It's typically only recommended to do about 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercise each week. There are benefits of increasing this amount to 300 minutes weekly, but you do not need to exceed this amount., Even if you think you're following a diet, there are some eating patterns or styles that are more than likely an eating disorder or considered a disordered eating pattern.   If you are eating very few calories daily, skipping meals regularly, avoiding large amounts of foods and/or several food groups, you may be dealing with an eating disorder.If you feel the need to exercise excessively after eating a large meal, need to throw up or take laxatives to reduce how many calories your body absorbs, this is another form of an eating disorder.Also, believing you have a variety of food allergies without an official diagnosis, food sensitivities or follow an overly restrictive diet may be caused by an underlying eating disorder. If you are struggling with disordered eating patterns, speak to your doctor immediately so that you can seek the appropriate treatment.  , Fad diets or crash diets are very popular today. They promise quick weight loss results with little effort. However, most fad diets don't work and many may actually be unsafe.You need to be able to recognize a fad diet, so you don't end up following an unsafe or extreme diet without knowing. Even if it sounds like a great plan or a good deal, it still may not be an appropriate method of weight loss. If a program promises large quantities of weight loss, weight loss in very short periods of time, or weight loss without you having to change your diet or exercise, you can almost be 100% sure this is a fad diet.Many fad diets promote a method of eating that can make you ill or interfere with current health conditions or medications. In addition, if you do lose weight, you'll typically gain it back very quickly once you discontinue the diet., Some diets may promote skipping meals or eat meals that are much too small for your body. This is not only extreme, but can be unsafe as well.   If you're skipping meals regularly to try to lose weight, you're actually working against your body. When you skip meals your body's metabolism naturally slows and burns fewer calories. Overtime, this may be less weight loss overall. In addition, by skipping meals, you may end up being overly hungry at your next eating session. You're more likely to overeat and eat higher fat foods when you skip meals.It's important to eat at least 3 meals daily. You may do better with 5 or 6 small meals a day or the traditional 3 meals with a snack or two. Whatever you decide, you should consume something every 4-5 hours.  , Other diets suggest following a very, very low calorie level to lose weight. This is not only unsafe, but you typically feel tired and fatigued during these types of diets.   Very low calorie diets are any program suggesting you eat less than about 800 calories daily.When you do not eat enough calories daily, you typically feel ill, tired and your body is not able to function normally. These types of diets are generally unbalanced as well which can lead to long-term health problems.Cutting out some calories is important when you're trying to lose weight. However, never eat less than 1200 calories total each day., There are also many diets and diet programs that advise avoiding entire food groups or many specific foods in order to lose weight. This is not balanced and is an extreme method of weight loss.   When you're diet is unbalanced due to a lack of a variety of foods or food groups, you're missing out on key nutrients that support a healthy body and weight loss. Again, this could lead to long-term health problems.Even if a diet says that certain foods cause inflammation, bloating or weight gain, you shouldn't avoid entire food groups or a large variety of foods unless you have a diagnosed food allergy or intolerance. On the flip side, a diet that suggests eating large quantities of only a few foods - like bananas or cabbage soup - are also unfounded and unsafe. Always strive for a balanced diet by including a large variety of foods from each food group: protein, dairy, grains, fruits and vegetables.  , A very trendy fad diet is a liquid diet or cleanse. Whether you're only drinking juice or a concoction of lemon juice and cayenne pepper, these diets are very unsafe and ineffective for weight loss.   Liquid diets and cleanses are unsafe for a whole host of reasons. However, they're mainly nutritionally inadequate and way too low in calories. Again, this can result in nutrient deficiencies, poor functioning overall and a high likelihood of regaining any weight you lost.If a diet suggests using a cleanse, juice diet or other liquid diet, this is an extreme and unfounded method of weight loss. Skip these at all costs. Diets advertising their detoxifying effects have no scientific justification. There is no evidence that toxins accumulating within our bodies can be removed through any cleansing diet. These diets are effective at weight loss because of calorie restriction, but they are actually a type of fasting.  , You may see commercials or internet ads for dieting pills or supplements. The idea being you take these supplements and it'll lead to weight loss.   Diets that suggest using these types of pills or supplements may be even more dangerous than a juice cleanse or overly low calorie diet. These pills and supplements are not regulated by the FDA for safety or efficacy which is why these are very dangerous.In addition, you will not know how these supplements will make you feel, interact with any medications you're taking or health conditions you have. These supplements are often released into the market without having been through legitimate clinical trials. Some contain substances that have never been associated with weight loss through research. It is unlikely that these will help you. You should never take a diet pill or supplement for weight loss (even if it seems like a natural herb or a vitamin or mineral). These should always be avoided at all costs.  , Whenever you're trying to lose weight, it's a good idea to meet with your doctor first. They'll be able to help you decide how to lose weight safely and effectively.   Make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your desire to lose weight. Ask them how much weight they recommend you losing and if they have any resources or a diet they recommend. You may also consider asking for a referral to a registered dietitian. These are nutrition and weight loss specialists that can help you design a personalized diet to fit your lifestyle and goals.  , Don't be discouraged if it takes you a long time to see visible results. Weight loss of ten pounds may be enough to result in noticeable health benefits for you, such as improved energy level and better sleep  Look for other people who are trying to lose weight with similar methods to yours. Keep each other motivated by sharing tips and experiences as well as discussing your progress and setbacks. Set mini-goals for the week or month. Celebrating small achievements can boost your motivation and help you track your progress. Accept your setbacks. Every day will not yield results. There will be some days when your program is disrupted for reasons out of your control, but the most important thing is not to allow one day or one week to break your weight loss journey. Get back on track at your earliest opportunity and problem solve if possible to prevent deviation in the future.  , Although following a very, very low calorie diet is considered extreme, you'll still need to cut out some calories in order to induce weight loss.   It's typically only recommended to cut out about 500 calories daily from your current diet. This generally results in 1-2 pounds of weight loss per week.Try keeping a food journal for a few days prior to making any changes to your diet. Tally up your total calorie intake to get an average idea of how many calories you typically eat. Subtract 500 from this amount to get a new goal to help you lose weight. Again, make sure to never go below 1200 calories daily. If you do the above calculation and get a value under 1200, you should use 1200 as your lowest level of intake.  , When you're attempting to lose weight, it's important to eat adequate amounts of protein each day. Protein is essential to weight loss and maintaining your health.   Protein is important for weight loss because it fuels and supports your metabolism. Plus, its more satisfying than other foods so you'll feel less hungry throughout the day when you're meeting your daily protein needs.Aim to include 1-2 servings of lean protein at each meal or snack. Measure out about 3-4 oz or a piece about the size of your hand.Include lean protein as these sources are lower in calories. Try: poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork, seafood, legumes, tofu or low-fat dairy products.  , Both fruits and vegetables are integral to any balanced diet, but especially in a weight loss diet.   Fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories, but high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Filling up on these foods helps you stick to a lower calorie diet while allowing you to meet your daily nutrient needs. Include 1-2 servings of fruits and vegetables at each meal to help you meet your daily recommended intake. Measure out 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens and a 1/2 cup of fruit per serving., Another food group that provides health benefits and supports weight loss is the grain group. These foods are filling and satisfying which can help you stick to your diet.   Whole grains are preferable to refined grains as they are less processed and contain more fiber, protein and other minerals. Refined grains have these nutritious parts removed during processing.Include at least one serving of whole grains at most of your meals, and try to make at least half of all grain servings whole grains. Make sure to measure out 1 oz or about 1/2 cup per serving.Whole grains to try include: whole wheat bread, millet, quinoa, oats, whole wheat pasta, brown rice or barley.  , Although not a food or food group, water is an essential nutrient that you need everyday. Ensure you're drinking adequate amounts to stay adequately hydrated.   Most health experts recommend drinking at least 8 glasses of water daily, but even up to 13 glasses daily. The more active you are, the more fluids you need each day.In addition, make sure you're only consuming calorie-free, caffeine-free fluids. This will help you stick to your diet and stay hydrated. Water, flavored water, sparkling water, decaf coffee and tea are appropriate.  , If you're looking for a diet plan to follow that isn't extreme, consider following the Mediterranean diet. This method of eating is not only healthy and well balanced but also supports heart health.The Mediterranean diet is based off the eating patterns of the people who live in countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. It's been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.The types of foods that are featured in this particular diet include: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, olive oil, seafood, the occasional red wine and herbs and spices.Foods like red meat, dairy products, and poultry are still consumed, but much more in moderation and typically not on a daily basis., The Ornish diet was constructed by Dr. Dean Ornish. This diet is also very well-balanced and may help reduce your risk of heart disease.   The Ornish diet is most well known for helping significantly reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure.The types of foods that the Ornish diet recommends include: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, eggs and low-fat dairy. This diet is lower in fat with only 10% of your total calories daily coming from fat sources. It suggests getting more of your protein from legumes, nuts, dairy and eggs over higher fat animal proteins.  , Although the DASH diet is typically prescribed for those with high blood pressure, it's a well-balanced diet that can also help you lose weight safely and effectively.The DASH diet also can help reduce your risk of osteoporosis, cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes.This eating plan focuses on foods like: whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy and lean protein (including seafood and legumes). It's a very well-balanced program. The DASH diet discourages the consumption of sodium in foods like fried foods, fast foods and processed foods. In addition it suggests limiting sweets and alcohol., If you're interested in losing larger quantities of weight or are having difficulty losing weight by yourself, you might want to consider signing up for a medically supervised weight loss program.   These weight loss programs are only available through a qualified physician's practice. It may include prescription weight loss medication (regulated by the FDA), protein supplements and vitamin and mineral supplementation.In addition, these programs require regular follow-up with a weight loss doctor, registered dietitian and exercise physiologist. They work to modify diet, exercise and lifestyle to help induce weight loss.Each medically supervised program is different. You may want to spend some time researching programs in your area to find one that fits your budget and lifestyle.

Even if your buddies from elementary school are still around, things will still feel different. Chances are you will make new friends and they will too, the dynamic is totally different. Go into it with an open mind. Embrace the chance to try things in a new way. You adapted well to school once, if you can remember that, so you can certainly do it again.   People you’ve known for years may start to seem different to you. You may start to seem different to them as well. This is a natural part of growing up.; , Is it academic achievement? Being a good person? Perhaps ideally it should be a combination of both of these. The best judge of whether or not you are a success in middle school is you. But you have to know your criteria. A good thing to do is to get the inside scoop from an older sibling or friend who went there to, to make the best first impression.   Your parents will have their own ideas of what success means for you. This is, of course, important as well. Talk with your parents about your goals for middle school and how you can work together to achieve them. Remember: you may disagree with your parents priorities but if you stay professional and don't throw a big tantrum if you don't get what you want you can usually work out a reasonable situation with both sides still happy and talking to each other.  , The middle school years are always a time of awkwardness. You are growing, your body is changing, and your interests are evolving. Yes, you’ll get pimples, trip over your own feet, feel embarrassed to get changed in the locker room, get rejected by that boy or girl you like, and so on. Don't worry it happens or has happened to all of us. A good thing to do is to imagine yourself in other people's shoes and try to imagine how you would feel in their situation and realize no one is analyzing everything you do. So chances are if you have one of those days where everything goes horribly and terribly wrong it's probably not going to be the talking point of the whole school for 5 years after. So just take a deep breath and relax.   For a good list of “survival skills” for common awkward situations in middle school, check out Survive Middle School. Also, don’t be embarrassed to talk to your parents, a teacher, the guidance counselor, you're friends or someone else who can help.  , The pressure to conform, or to be like everyone else, grows as you become a teenager. Don’t let peer pressure dictate who you are or what you want to achieve. Although if it does, don't freak out. It's ok to fit in a little bit despite what all the books say. Do what is right for yourself and what you’re interested in.   Stick up for what you believe in and what you know is right. For instance, turn in someone who is bullying you or other kids. If this costs you a childhood friend, don’t worry. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to make new, better friends in middle school.  , Teenagers may not have the reputation for being the neatest, most organized bunch. But you can work to keep yourself and your school materials in order. Doing so will increase your ability to be successful in school. A student planner book is a calendar where you can write down when assignments are due, when you have soccer or choir practice, and when you have sleepovers with friends. Keep track of your schedule and look at your planner every day. Writing in it after every class can be a good way to start the habit if you're having trouble. , Have one notebook for each of your classes. You may even want to color-code them, so you know that the blue notebook is for History and the red notebook is for Algebra.   Keep these binders organized. Use dividers to separate notes from assignments. The less time it takes you to find your notes, homework, and study guides, the more time you have to actually get things done.  , Go ahead and decorate your locker to show off your personality. Make sure that the things you put in your locker are practical, the biggest mistake is to make your locker an extension of the locker decorations store and not be able to put anything that actually needs to be in there because you decided to buy a locker rug, pool table, chandelier, and minibar. Definitely make sure to organize it so you can be in and out of it quickly. You don’t want to have things spilling out of it every time you open it.  , Carve out a place for yourself at home to do your homework. This will ideally be a desk with a chair and computer or laptop. Keep the desk clear so that you can easily sit down and do your homework after school every day.   Store all your school supplies in one place so that you’re not hunting all over the house for the pencil sharpener.  , Talk with your parents on Sunday afternoon to see what the week looks like. Use this time to remind your parents about your upcoming game or concert. You will also know which nights you might have to help out with dinner.  , It sounds obvious, but it’s a key part of being successful in middle school. Studies show that good grades and consistent attendance in middle school are indicators of future academic success in high school and college.Get to school on time and don’t skip classes.If you need to miss school, make sure you talk with your teacher about the material you missed. While you're gone email him or her and check their website if they have one for assignments. Catch up on your homework as soon as possible.  , Whether you had to do it in elementary school or not, the amount of note-taking you will need to do in middle school will be a new experience. Good note taking doesn’t mean furiously writing down everything the teacher says. Instead, try these strategies to take good notes:Keep your notes organized by starting a new sheet every day. Put the date at the top of the page and what you're learning. Listen for audio cues by your teacher. She will tend to vocally emphasize what is most important. Don’t worry about writing whole sentences. Instead, develop your own shorthand and shortcuts. Remember, no one has to be able to read it but you, go ahead a write a squiggle every time your teacher says ""Mitosis"". It's okay as long as you understand it. Review your notes each day when you’re doing your homework. Rewrite your notes more neatly and fully. This will also help the information stick in your brain better.  , Like note-taking, the amount of studying required in middle school will likely be a surprise. Good study skills do not mean simply memorizing the textbook chapter. Here are some ideas for studying successfully:Learn to identify the most important concepts. Highlight key names, themes, etc., in your notes and put sticky notes in your textbook to mark key passages. Rewrite your notes so that you can organize the information and make your writing neat and easy to follow. Create study aids such as flash cards, diagrams, and so on. Find a study buddy. This is ideally someone who has a good grasp on the material. Working together may help you see things from a different angle. Work hard to stay focused on studying. Talk about music or football another time.  , Tests may be more complicated and you’ll be responsible for knowing more material. To take tests successfully, follow some of these strategies:   Listen to instructions that your teacher gives you. Read all the directions on the test.Pace yourself. Be sure to leave yourself enough time to finish the entire test. Don’t keep looking at the clock, since that might stress you out more. But gauge how long it might take you to answer questions in each section of the test. If a question stumps you, come back to it later.Double-check all of your answers. Reduce anxiety you might feel about taking tests. When you are more prepared and understand the material, your anxiety will lessen. Take deep breaths before the exam and repeat to yourself, “I will do well on this test.”, There are more demands on your time in middle school. You’ll have more classes, more homework, more tests, and more extracurricular activities. Improving your time management skills is key. Make your schoolwork a top priority, so that you get it done on time.   Try to complete all your homework as soon as you arrive home from school. Do this before distractions and responsibilities take over. If you have to attend to other things as soon as school is over, block out a specific time each evening for homework completion. Keep limits on your “screen time.” This includes your phone, TV, computer, etc.Don’t play computer games or text with your friends until your homework is done, for example. Take responsibility for your own learning and homework. Don’t copy your friend’s homework. If you’re having trouble keeping up in a class, talk to your teacher sooner rather than later. Don’t wait until you’ve fallen hopelessly behind.  , As you get older, more of the responsibility for your academic success rests on your own shoulders. But this doesn’t mean you have to go it alone. There are many different people who want to help you, so let them.   If you’re having trouble with pre-algebra or early American history, for instance, talk to your teachers about additional resources that might help. Your teachers may even be able to suggest tutoring options.  , If you haven’t done your homework, don’t lie to your teacher. Instead, tell your teacher that you will work on it tonight and hand it in tomorrow. Your teacher will appreciate that you’re taking responsibility.   Don’t cheat on tests or copy other people’s homework. If you do and you get caught, don’t try to lie your way out of it. Tell the truth.  , In middle school, you’re in more classes with new people. Instead of feeling sad about how things are different, seize the chance to expand your horizons. There are so many opportunities to get active and get involved when you reach middle school.   Join a club. Math clubs, service organizations, and the student council are some of the opportunities in middle school. Meet new people (or old people in new ways) and discover your passions and what the new, more mature you can accomplish. Play a sport. Try out for the basketball or soccer team. Even if you end up riding the bench, you’ll enjoy the camaraderie and competition. Volunteer. Do a trash pickup or help set up a bake sale for a good cause. Recruit old and new friends for the cause. Don’t be afraid to take the initiative.  , As soon as you hit middle school, you’ll be mixed in with new kids as well as older kids. You’ll have opportunities to connect with people who seem exciting and new. But in your preteen and teenage years, it’s important to surround yourself with positive, supportive people. The friends you have in middle school are good indicators of how well you’ll succeed in the coming years, so choose wisely.If you feel like a “friend” isn’t very nice to you, talk with her about it. If she doesn’t change her ways, it’s probably better in the long run to move on. Make sure to stay away from others who are reckless and get into trouble a lot. Even if they are your friends, don't let them drag you down with them and possibly jeopardize your academic success or other relationships and friendships.  , In middle school, kids are experiencing puberty full-force and hormones start up. You’re probably thinking about that cute boy or girl and whether you might start dating. It’s important during this time to understand what a healthy relationship looks like. Studies show that middle schoolers experience sexual harassment and dating violence at high rates, in part because they don’t recognize what is appropriate or not.   Healthy relationships start with respect, trust and friendship. You should also feel free to have other friends and be independent. Don’t feel pressured to start dating yet. You may feel that because your friends are dating, you should be too. But some studies show that when you start dating too early, your attention turns away from academics and you may actually perform worse on your school work., People change as they become teenagers. It may well be that some kid you’ve known for years but never really were friends with has become a natural fit for the older you.   Teenagers naturally seem to organize themselves into like-minded groups or cliques. This isn’t always a bad thing, but don’t be too quick to judge and exclude people. Be welcoming and inclusive to others. Set a positive example.  , Treat other people with kindness and friendliness. Put yourself in the other person’s shoes before you say or do something hurtful.   Stand up for others if you see bullying going on. Don’t stand by and let others be bullied. If you are being bullied or see it happening to someone else, report it to a teacher. Bullying is not acceptable behavior.  , Your middle school years are about the time when you start feeling like you can do everything on your own. But keep in mind that there are plenty of people around you who are ready and willing to help. Your parents are great resources, believe it or not. They went through a lot of the same things you’re going through now.Ask for advice on things like taking notes in class, studying for tests, staying out of trouble, even (gasp!) asking a boy or girl to the school dance.  , Older brothers and sisters have more recently gone through middle school. They’re likely to have good tips about how to deal with each teacher, which lunch line to choose, and so on.  , At the start of the school year, talk to each of your teachers about class expectations and ideas on how to do well in the class. Continue talking with your teachers throughout the year to make sure you are meeting expectations. It’s important to take responsibility for your own learning.   Get to know other adults at the school as well, from administrators and guidance counselors to nurses and librarians.  , There is no shame in seeking help when you need it. The school counselor is there to help you, and is knowledgeable about the issues that are troubling to middle schoolers. This person can give you guidance about academic challenges as well as social and personal issues.If you have thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 800-273-TALK (8255).  , Life gets busier in middle school, and will keep getting busier after that. Being rested, refreshed, energized, and focused is the best way to stay ahead of the curve instead of falling behind. Your body is still growing and going through changes. You need adequate rest to function at your best. If your schedule is especially busy, you’re using up lots of energy during the day and you need to replace it. Aim to get eight to nine hours of sleep every night.If you’re having trouble getting to sleep, turn off all screens about 15 to 30 minutes before bed. Studies show that your brain is engaged when you are looking at information on a screen, which can contribute to difficulty getting to sleep., Proper nutrition will help your memory, concentration, mood, energy level, and self-image. These are all important components of a successful middle school student. So skip the vending machine and eat real food. Try to get lots of fruits and vegetables, proteins, whole grains and low-fat dairy. Stay away from processed and fried foods, as well as foods high in refined sugar.   Start the day with a good breakfast. Studies show that a good breakfast will help you improve your performance on school work throughout the day.Try a fruit and yogurt smoothie, oatmeal or eggs and toast., Exercising regularly is a great way to reduce stress, boost brain function, and improve your mood. Kids and teens should get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day. Skip watching TV after school and instead, head out for a bike ride with a friend., There will be times when it seems like too much – too much homework, too much pressure, or too many annoying kids in English class. But know that you can and will make it. Keep your goals in mind and focus on what you need to do to achieve them. You can be a success.   You’ll figure things out as you go. You learn by trying, and sometimes failing, and always by getting back up and trying again.

Some things that a flash mob is not:   A flash mob is not appropriate as a marketing vehicle for a product or service (despite several attempts at this), political purposes or a publicity stunt. The reason is that these do not carry the element of entertainment or satire without strings attached for the observers. These sorts of events have their motive as an expectation that observers will then do something like buy a product, vote for someone or support a particular cause. A flash mob is not an excuse for violence or damaging property. To participate in something that results in this is to be part of a rioting mob or crowd, not a flash mob. Never have the intent to create a violent or harmful event from a flash mob exercise. (Public authorities in some places have taken to naming crime sprees as ""flash mobs,"" but criminal behavior has nothing to do with flash mobs as performance art.)  , The success of a flash mob event is dependent on the originality, liveliness, and attractiveness of the event. Avoid copying a flash mob event that has been performed somewhere else. Always make alterations to any flash mob performance that has inspired you so that it has your own mark of originality and local relevance. In all cases, the performance must be worked out in advance and either rehearsed or well explained in some manner (such as through online instructions) so that everyone knows their role and interactions with the other performers. The most typical flash mob performances involve such activities as:    Choreographed dance: an example would be a large group all performing a dance in the park to support a lover proposing to his girlfriend. Singing something such as opera, yodeling, or a pop hit. Any style of singing is fine, but make sure it's interesting. An example would be breaking into song about the wonders of fruits and vegetables while in the supermarket. Acting out a particular scenario: such as lots of people walking invisible dogs on leashes.  Mime: An example would be pretending to try to find a way through a wall that isn't there. Using an existing joyful event to spread love: An example would a wedding, graduation or anniversary celebration being taken to a street, mall or other public place to spread the joy!  World Record: Trying to break a Guinness World Record by having the largest gathering doing ""X"" at the same time.  Freeze Flash Mob: All members become living statues and freeze.  , There is quite a collection available to watch and this will provide an excellent source of inspiration. It will also as give you ideas about how to handle your group of people and have the performance come together. Like all performance, timing and execution are critical to the success of a flash mob.  , You'll need willing performers to participate in the flash mob and for that, you can make good use of online resources. Use social media networks, emails, texting and websites to find people for your flash mob. You may also be able to draw on the resources of a class you're in, a performance or dance group you're a part of, or other groups of people you spend time with. Ask your friends and family if they'd like to be a part of it too.   Use Facebook, Twitter, and websites to bring people together. People will be searching for a flash mob with the words ""flash mob"" or ""flash mob"" so be sure to include these in any message you're creating to find people. Improv Everywhere is based in New York City and while not all of its street performances are flash mobs, some are and you might be able to participate with them if you're located in NYC. Check out their website for more information. There are many local flash mob websites; just use a search engine to find them using your location name and the term ""flash mob"".  , The success of your flash mob event will require your participants to know exactly what to do. It is best if you can have a rehearsal beforehand, but if this isn't possible, then at least provide very clear instructions (either online or by email, etc.) as to what to wear, where to be at what time, what to do (for example: Be prepared to freeze, walk, dance, gape like a fish, etc, on the corner of 55th street and 3rd avenue at 7am), and how long to do the act for. If any participants need to interact together, it's best if they rehearse this for the sake of timing and accuracy.   If the instructions are simple, such as everyone stand in one place reading a newspaper they've cut eye holes in, then the simplicity of the action will probably mean you don't need to rehearse. However, it's a very good idea for everyone participating to try to meet up somewhere prior to the event to quickly run over the details, what's expected of the event and participants, and what to do when it's over. It's also helpful to explain what to do if people get annoyed or the police try to shift the group. If the instructions are complex, especially where scenes need to be choreographed and organized, then consider having a smaller group of people you are certain can turn up to rehearsals and keep fairly quiet about the event, rather than having a much larger and harder to coordinate group. About 50 people can be organized fairly successfully, but higher numbers mean that things start getting trickier. It can be easier to coordinate a dance group you're already involved in. For example, getting a group of your Zumba practitioners from the local gym to perform in the street together might be a great chance for the participants to show off what they've learned already.  , It's best to ask the participants to bring their own props or to organize their own costume gear (such as evening wear, swimsuits, wigs, whatever) but sometimes you'll need to provide things for everyone (such as dog leashes a collar for an invisible dog walk).   If the props or costumes are difficult for people to find or make on their own, consider holding a workshop beforehand in which everyone has the opportunity to create the items needed. However, you should aim for simple clothes and items, or things that people already have in their wardrobe or house.  , Do a proper check of the area you're proposing to perform the flash mob in. There may be safety, legal, or physical limits on what can be done in the location. To avoid getting into trouble legally, it's important to not create unsafe obstructions, safety problems, or to hold up people in ways that prevent them from their usual business on non-public premises. While there is obviously a balance between encouraging people to watch and blocking people from getting on with their usual activities, you need to judge that your flash mob won't be the cause of emergency or unlawful situations. For example, if your flash mob would be likely to block emergency exits, then think again about where to locate the event.   As mentioned above, tell your participants what to do in the event that the police or some other authority requests that your group leave. The best option is to do as asked quietly and peacefully. In any case, a well-run, legitimate flash mob will be over and done with before these people even arrive.  , It's definitely worth having the whole event filmed so that you can upload it to YouTube. Who knows? It might even go viral! If nothing else, it will serve as inspiration for other flash mobs into the future.  , trust that the flash mob will go according to plan! As the organizer, you remain responsible for ensuring that the flash mob sticks to the plan and doesn't create problems for the public at the event.  , Once the flash mob event is over, don't allow the participants to sit around and talk or to start talking to the crowd. They need to mingle back with the crowd and head off into the sunset as if nothing ever took place.  , Do you want it to be something up-tempo or more mellow? Do you want something well known or something that displays a certain style of music, such as opera?; , If this is you, great. If not, get someone who knows how to help turn a group dance into something spectacular.  , A park in a major city is a great spot, especially during lunch hour or after work when everyone is heading home.  , Flash mob dances can be any number of people but try to aim for at least 50-75. It may sound like a lot to arrange but the more people you have, the more effective the flash mob dance becomes.  , This way you don't have to get too many people in the same room or area at once and they can also entertain the crowd from different perspectives. This is good for people who can't see the whole scene in front of them.  , This will be the best dancer in the group, the person who sets the beat and provides a following point for the remaining dancers. The leader can start the routine with a solo dance move, then attract the next group of 9 to 15 dancers who join in with the next move. Then, double the group's size with 16 to 30 dancers joining in. The trick to a good flash mob is to gradually get all of the dancers involved in the routine. Get the rest of them to join in in the last part of the song so that the entire group is finally involved.  , As soon as the song has finished, the dancers must disperse as normal members of the crowd to act as if nothing has happened.

If your horse is acting up, it can be hard to prepare the halter in the moment.   Unbuckle or unsnap the crown piece. This is the strap of the halter that goes behind the horse's ears. It should have a buckle or snap somewhere on it. Have your halter clipped to your lead line ahead of time. You want to be able to halter your horse and immediately lead him where he needs to go. You clip the lead line onto a ring at the bottom of the noseband. The noseband is the portion of a halter that slips around a horse's nose.; , Call your horse as you approach him. This helps alert your horse to your presence. This way, he's less likely to get spooked by your approach. Call out his name or call out something like, ""I'm coming in!"" to let him know you're entering his pasture or stall., Make sure you have your halter in your left hand as you approach. You will be haltering the horse from the left side. You want to make sure your horse knows what's happening. If you try to deceive the horse by hiding the halter, he'll learn to be distrustful of your intent. This can lead to a bad relationship between you and the horse., When haltering a horse, you should always approach from the left side. Halters are designed to be buckled on the left. You should approach your horse so you're standing near his head on the left side of his body., You do not want to put the halter on instantly. This can startle your horse. When you are a foot or so away from your horse's head, allow him to sniff your hand. This way, your horse will also familiarize himself with your scent. He'll be able to differentiate your smell from the smell of potential predators in other situations down the road.A nervous horse may benefit from having treats as a reward for staying calm.  , A halter needs to be slipped over your horse's head in a specific manner. Once you've reached the horse, position the halter in the same direction as the horse's head. The noseband of the halter should be facing the same direction as the horse is facing., Once your halter is in the right position, loop the lead rope towards the bottom of the horse's neck. This will provide you some control if your horse gets impatient during the haltering process and tries to run away., From here, gently guide the halter over the horse's nose. Slip the horse's nose through the nose band. Then, slip your right hand under the horse's throat. Use your right hand to place the crown piece behind his ears, gently bending his ears back as needed. Adjust the halter as necessary to make sure it's straight and not cutting into the horse's ears., Once the halter is on, buckle up or snap up the crown piece. Hold the halter in place with your left hand. Use your right hand to buckle the end of the crown piece into the buckle on the left side of your horse's head.Check to make sure the halter is not too tight. It should be tight enough that the horse cannot slip out of it. However, it should also be loose enough that the straps are not digging into the horse's skin. If it's too tight or too loose, you may need to use a different sized halter next time., Your horse may be nervous about being haltered. Reassure your horse as you go. Talk to him in a soothing voice and pet him if he seems agitated or upset.  , You want to make sure you have the right sized halter. An ill-fitting halter can cause your horse pain. If the halter is cutting into the horse's skin or fur, you could resize the crown piece by adjusting the buckles. However, some halters may simply be too small for your horse. Go to a local tack shop and get a bigger halter if moving to the next notch on the buckle does not help.You can measure a horse's head to find the right size halter. Use a measuring tape and place it midway between your horse's cheekbones and nostrils. Stretch the tape to the same point on the other side of your horse's head. Write down this measurement. This is the size noseband you need. If your horse reacts poorly to a measuring tape, wrap string around his nose and then measure the string's length afterwards.Place the end of the measuring tape directly under a horse's cheekbone. Stretch the tape to the cheekbone on the other side of his face. This measurement indicates how big of a crown piece you'll need. Then, place the tape several inches behind the horse's eye and stretch it near the top of his throat. Then, move the tape underneath this throat to the top of his throat on the other side of his face. This measurement shows you how big the halter's throatlatch should be. As with the noseband, you can use string if your horse dislikes the feel of a measuring tape.If you have a horse with special needs size-wise, you may need a particular type of halter. Draft horses need halters specifically made for larger breeds. If your horse has a narrow head, you may have to do some trial and error. Try halters from a variety of manufacturer's until you find a halter that fits., There are some basic safety guidelines you should practice when haltering your horse. You want to make sure your horse is safe during the haltering process.   Never let a horse run loose with his halter still in place. Halters can catch on tree branches and fences, causing injury. Leather halters can easily become damp and gather mildew. This can cause them to slip off your horse easily. Clean them regularly and store them in a clean, dry place when not in use. Never tie or wrap a lead line around a horse's head. If a horse gets startled or upset, this could cause injury.  , It can be difficult to halter break an adult horse. Therefore, if possible, start halter breaking the horse as soon as he is born.   Foals should be handled by adults right away. You want horses used to a human touch as young as possible. Try placing a halter on a foal within his first few days of life.Place the haler on and off your foal each day as he grows up. He will begin to accept the halter as a normal part of life. Later, he will easily go along with being haltered as an adult., If you have an adult horse who is not halter-broken, you'll have to start slow. To begin, handle your horse's head, ears, and neck. Each day, interact with the horse. Pet his neck, ears, and head.Reward the horse for allowing you to touch him. Offer treats, like carrots or apples, if he remains calm when you're petting him.Talk gently to your horse as you go. Provide soothing words to prevent the horse from getting nervous or upset.  , Once the horse is comfortable with your touch, introduce him to the halter. For a few days, simply hold the halter as you pet him. Allow him to sniff the halter and get used to its presence and scent. Then, try gently slipping the halter over his nose and ears.It may take multiple tries. If a horse gets antsy with the halter over his nose, take the halter off. You can try again the next day.It may be a few days before you get the halter on the horse and buckled properly. This is normal. It's important to have patience and let the horse work at a pace that does not frighten him. If your horse develops an aversion to the halter, halter breaking will be even more difficult., Once the horse is used to the halter, you'll need to practice leading. Attach a lead rope to the halter and begin your practice sessions.   During the first few sessions, stand to the right of the horse. Pull on the lead rope, applying pressure, to encourage the horse to move. When your horse turns his head towards you, praise him. Reinforce the good behavior with treats. Give him a slice of apple, for example, when he turns his head.You can teach your horse to step forwards by pulling on the halter until he moves. Stop applying pressure once your horse takes a step forward. Then, pull back on the halter. When your horse steps backwards, stop applying pressure. Consider rewarding your horse with food for good behavior.Work your way up. As your horse gets used to moving forward and backward, try to get him to walk with you. Do a little bit each day. For example, start with five steps. In a few days, increase this to ten steps. Keep going until your horse is comfortable walking with you when wearing the halter., You want halter breaking to be a pleasant experience. Any negative associations with the halter can set you back greatly when it comes to halter breaking. Avoid punishing your horse during the process.   Do not yell at your horse, whip him, or behave in an aggressive manner. The halter is new and unfamiliar and your horse may be scared. Have patience. If your horse acts up, take a break and try again.Each lesson should end on a successful note. Even if all you manage to do is get the halter over the horse's nose, this is still a victory. If you sense your horse getting tense or uncomfortable, stop.",1632,"['halter', 'head', 'left hand', 'nose', 'left side', 'ears', 'lead line', 'neck', 'direction', 'practice basic safety guidelines', 'hand', 'horse']"

If you’re joining a school band, you can usually rent tubas directly. Most concert tubas are available in a few different pitches, which may be more appropriate for the style of music you plan on playing. You can get tubas pitched in BBb, CC, Eb, and F.Eb tuba is used for brass bands (almost exclusively) and some soloing F tuba is used for passages requiring higher notes and solo works. It is also seen in small ensemble settings (brass quintet, brass quartet, etc) BBb and CC tubas are intended for large ensemble playing (band, orchestra, etc.) BBb tubas are more common at the high school, college, and amateur level as sousaphones are pitched in BBb, but professional orchestra players in the U.S. use CC tubas. In Europe it can vary from country to country.; , Mouthpieces come in different sizes, so be sure to get one that is best suited for you and your size. Generally made of fiberglass or composite metal, a good mouthpiece is essential to a properly tuned and played instrument.   If you buy a used tuba, or rent one, make sure you get your own new mouthpiece. A good quality mouthpiece is important to develop the proper buzzing technique and breath support. A fiberglass mouthpiece is sometimes used as an alternative because temperature doesn't effect its intonation as much as a metal mouthpiece. Fiberglass mouthpieces may work and are more inexpensive but you lose some quality sound and overtones.  , Tubas are not generally played standing up, unless you're playing a sousaphone, which is designed for use in a marching band. In order to practice, you'll need a good chair, in which you can maintain proper posture and balance to build the skills that will keep your notes pure.   Get a basic hard-backed chair without any arm wrests, or a stool that you can sit on comfortably. Avoid practicing on the couch, in a recliner, or in otherwise less-than-upright conditions. You can't get the breath-support necessary to play correctly, and you'll build poor habits into your practice routine.  , No point in learning the mechanics of the tuba if you can't read the music or apply what you've learned. While it's difficult to learn to play any instrument properly from a book, it's a great way to get the basics down and figure out how to start playing music on the tuba, as well as how to hold and play it properly.   If you're trying to use a computer to aid you, having a projector connected to it is probably the only way it wouldn't be an inconvenience. It's good to get started online, but finding a professional method book is the best way to learn an instrument. Wait to troubleshoot technique issues online after you've got the fundamentals down.  , Your back should be straight, and your head should be lifted comfortably so that you're looking straight ahead at the conductor, if there is one, or straight ahead if you're playing alone. Your back should not be touching the back of the chair, your feet flat on the floor., Depending on your height, it may be appropriate to rest the tuba on the chair between your legs or rest it on your lap, gently on the top of your thighs. If it's a full-size tuba, you may want to get a stand to set it on.   It's important to position the tuba in such a way that you will not have to bend yourself to reach the mouthpiece. Bring the horn to you, don't bend to the horn. When you try to fill the horn with air, you'll notice a big difference.  , On a right-handed tuba, you'll lean the tuba slightly to the left, using your left hand to support the lean. Place your right hand on the valves, either on the broad part of the pad on a rotary tuba, or with your fingertips on the center of the valves on a valve tuba.   Most tubas have a small ring to put your thumb through. This forces your hand to stay in place and helps give a bit of support from your right hand. Find the ring, if your tuba has one, and position your hand accordingly. On a lefty tuba, you'll be resting the tuba practically on your left leg which is why stands are very important for lefty players. Your right hand has to reach for the valves, but it will also be providing a lot of support. The left hand will keep things balanced.  , Let your lap support the tuba, not your arms. Try to relax your shoulders and let your arms hold the tuba loosely. Treat it like your date, not like your wrestling partner. The more comfortably you can move around the horn, the better you'll be able to play.  , Remember, this is a big instrument, so your air needs to be big and fast to get the sound out out of the horn. Breath deep down into your diaphragm, not up high in your throat. That air has a long way to go, so start it out from a place of power.   Unless you're playing a Sousaphone in a marching band, the goal is not to blow all of your air reserves through the horn at once, but to keep your diaphragm taunt. If someone were to punch you in the stomach, you should stay tight and not collapse. Tense your abdominal muscles while you play and while you blow., While blowing, close your lips to the point that it vibrates in the mouthpiece. Keep blowing and vibrating your lips so that sound gets out of the tuba. As tuba is a large brass, try blowing a raspberry into the mouthpiece. That's the kind of vibration you are looking at. Once you've got your buzz figured out, start your note by saying either ""ta"" or ""da"" into the mouthpiece, depending on how you want to articulate the note.   A properly maintained ""embouchure"" is critical to playing brass instruments. It's difficult to buzz your lips properly when you're first learning how to play. Don't puff out your cheeks. It's a waste of air that should be going into your horn, it looks silly, and you'll end up with very sore cheeks after only a brief period of playing.  , At any given position or configuration of keys pressed and open, you can play a number of notes, usually three. Some beginners have difficulty hitting a note right the first time, but don't worry too much while you're just getting started. Practice feeling where the different registers are.   Pinch your cheeks and your lips as you blow to control the amount of air that comes through your ""buzz."" You can raise or lower the pitch of the note in the same position, accordingly. Try associating how the note will sound, where the note is on the staff, what it feels like to play the note, and the fingering for it. Many beginners only associate the note on the staff and the fingering for it, so they become confused when playing notes with the same fingering but different mouth positions.  , Once you've started to get a feel for the register of the tuba, start experimenting with fingerings. Press the keys and practice doing so in time with the notes that you play. Whether you're studying along with a book or receiving lessons, start practicing fingering the keys fully and playing clear notes with the valves pressed.   Most guide books should come with finger charts, which correspond the fingerings to the specific notes on the scale that you want to play. This is an excellent way to learn to play. Push the valve in the center, not on the rim. Pushing it on the rim can make the valve stuck.  , Start learning your fingerings and playing scales to develop the fundamentals to start playing music.Scales might not be the most exciting thing to learn when you're first getting started, but before you know it you'll be able to hit all the right ones to play the ""Imperial March"" from Star Wars (the ""Stairway to Heaven"" of the tuba) and take off from there.  , The tuba is both a rhythmic and a melodic instrument, providing the big, sturdy, bottom line of the band. To be the best tuba player you can be, it's important to practice playing rhythmically, so you play not only the right notes, but the right notes at the right time. Great tuba players are as rhythmically precise as a drummer and as melodically clear as a trumpet player.   Practice with a metronome. Even when you're playing scales, play them in time. When you're playing your practice songs, play them in time. Learn to internalize that sense of time by tapping your feet and paying close attention to your rhythmic motion. Practice your counting. Sometimes, tuba notes will be spaced out very far, meaning that you'll mostly be counting empty measures on some songs. Develop a good method for counting rests to make sure you're always on time for your big notes.  , Tuba is a much better instrument when you play it with others. Sometimes, the sheet music for a song on tuba involves only a few notes, which you can learn quickly and get bored with just as fast. But when you add the trumpets and the trombones, the flutes and the clarinets, those few notes become so much more. You're making music.   Consider taking private lessons as well. Like most instruments, learning a tuba properly usually requires in-person instruction. Whether you receive that in school band or in private lessons, getting one-on-one instruction is a good way of keeping you from building bad habits and moving forward with your playing.

While this isn't something that you need to start learning when you're first getting to know your way around the tuba, developing the clarity, tone, and speed of your notes can be helped with learning to tongue quickly.   When double tonguing, think either ta-ka-ta-ka or da-ga-da-ga. Try saying it first, and when you try double tonguing, think as if your tongue is moving in one of the two ways described above. Triple tonguing has four approaches: Ta-ta-ka, ta-ka-ta, da-da-ga, or da-ga-da. Try all, and choose the one that works best on you and stick with it.  , A tuba isn't as delicate as say, a violin, but it is still quite prone to denting and scratching. Always transport your instrument in a case and learn to maintain your tuba to get the best possible sound.   Empty the water that is in your tuba frequently by pushing the water key and blowing air into the instrument without vibrating your lips. Check individual valves by pressing down each one in turn and blowing; if there's any water in the tubing, it should sound and feel obvious. You may need to remove the tubing or rotate the tuba to clear everything. Find somewhere for tuba repairs. Professional instrument repairmen might charge you a pretty penny for fixing things, but they know what they're doing and it's better than ruining a giant investment by messing with something you don't understand.

Without the necessary skills, your business may struggle.Different types of work-at-home franchises will require different skill sets. For example, if you plan to do direct sales on the internet under the branding and marketing of an existing franchise, you probably won't have any staff, so personnel management shouldn't be an issue. On the other hand, if you want to open a home cleaning business and operate it out of your home, you will need to be able to hire, manage, and coordinate several cleaning teams as your business grows. Unless you're looking to change fields entirely, your best bet is to buy a franchise in an industry in which you already have extensive work experience. If you are trying to transition to a different career, focus on areas that require similar skills. Many operational and management skills can be transitioned from one industry to another with a little work. However, this is not the place for ego. It's important to believe in yourself and your abilities, but to avoid getting in over your head you should focus on a franchise that will maximize the skills and experience you have and can objectively prove you have.; , If the only reason you're interested in a particular franchise opportunity is that you think you'll make lots of money, you may not have the passion necessary to sustain your business and yourself through the lean months.Especially if you're going to be running your business as a one-person show, a work-at-home franchise can be an isolating and lonely endeavor.  #*If the work you're doing isn't something you're passionate and excited about, you'll burn out quickly. Distinguish between things you're merely interested in and things you're passionate about. If possible, focus on franchise opportunities that speak to your passion – interest may wane in the face of the grinding work of building your business.  , Buying a franchise means you have a ready-made reputation and brand, but it doesn't mean you can just sit back and watch the money roll in. It takes a lot of work to build a small business, and if you lack the self-discipline and ability to motivate yourself, you may find your business floundering.When you go to work every day, you have a supervisor who evaluates your progress, calls you out when you make a mistake, and keeps you on task. Not having someone looking over your shoulder or depending on you to get work done can be a difficult transition to make. Being your own boss doesn't mean you can do whatever you want whenever you want. What it does mean is that you must be able to objectively evaluate and critique your own performance, keep yourself on task, and learn from past mistakes.  , A franchise isn't exactly a ""business in a box."" You likely will have to purchase equipment, materials and supplies to get your business off the ground, even if you will be working from home.Resources include knowledge as well as space and equipment. If you've never operated your own business before, look for franchise opportunities that provide a lot of training materials for new franchisees. Consider how quickly you want to build your business and identify your goals in starting the business. For example, if you're a stay-at-home dad who just wants to earn a little money on the side to help your wife with the home finances as well as stay sharp in your field, you may prefer a slow build and not be interested in building your business into a local juggernaut. On the other hand, if you want to quit your day job and operate your work-at-home franchise as your sole source of income, you may need to build your business more quickly, but you'll also need to be efficient and have strong time-management skills. As far as equipment is concerned, look at things you already own that you could convert to business use. For example, if you already have a computer that you could use, that will save you start-up cash because you won't have to buy a new one.  , For a work-at-home franchise, the franchise fee itself may be your single largest expense – and often the fee itself is just the beginning as it only gives you the right to use the company's brand and images in your own business.Keep in mind that initial fees for work-at-home franchises often run into the low five figures. If you don't have that kind of money lying around, you're going to have to find a way to finance your purchase. Typically the higher the franchise fee, the more you get for your investment. High-dollar franchises, for example, may come with extensive training or substantial starting packages of products and tools. On the other hand, higher franchise fees often mean you're paying for the brand. This isn't a bad thing, as a well-known and established brand is worth more and you'll find it easier to build your business when you can rely on that brand and reputation. Ultimately, the franchise fee is only a single slice of the start-up pie – even if it is the largest slice. While you should look at the amount of any franchise fee with some skepticism, it all comes down to how much money you're comfortable investing in yourself and your business. Keep in mind that in addition to the up-front franchise fee, you may be responsible for continuing royalties to the franchisor for the use of their trademarks.  , Any equipment or supplies you don't already have in your possession, you'll have to purchase – and as your business grows, those expenses may grow along with it. Good start-up costs include at least the first year of operation, when you're unlikely to turn a profit.Include in your estimate any classes or training you think you might need to take before you get started, as well as any licenses or permits you may need to get from your city or state before you can start operations. If you plan to hire an accountant for your business, or want to have a lawyer look over the franchise agreement with you before you sign it, their fees also should be factored into your estimate of start-up costs. One of the benefits of a work-at-home franchise is that you may already own much of the equipment and supplies you'll need to get started. However, you may want to consider new office equipment if what you have is several years old or doesn't meet the technical specifications of the franchisor. You also want to include any other personal costs you'll incur as a result of starting a business, such as needing to hire a nanny a few days a week to care for your kids.  , Before you buy a franchise, you need to have a concrete understanding of your monthly expenses and be able to project your cash flow to produce reliable estimates of the income you'll produce in the first years of your business.If you intend to apply for a traditional business loan, you typically will need a full-scale business plan, of which financial projections are only a part. However, even if you have neither the need nor desire to create a detailed business plan, you'll still need financial forecasts to figure out your true start-up costs. Keep in mind that for the first few months of your business, you can't expect to make very much money. Even though your overhead will be relatively low if you're working from home, your first few months of operating expenses still should be accounted for in your start-up costs. You may want to work with an accountant or business consultant if you're unskilled at creating financial projections.  , If you don't have significant liquid assets, you may be able to get a business loan to cover a portion of your franchise fees and start-up expenses while you build your business.Conventional wisdom tells you to use your own money or borrow from family or friends, but in many cases this simply isn't an option. While traditional business loans are certainly a way to go, keep in mind lending institutions will require significant information about you and your personal finances before they will approve your application. Micro-lending sites are another way to raise the money that you need. Although they don't tend to have the same stringent requirements as banks and other traditional lending companies, you typically will pay higher interest. Another possibility is to talk to franchisors about financing. Many franchisors offer installment payment programs that allow you to pay the franchise fee over the course of several months rather than paying them all of it up front. Franchisor financing may be a solid option, but keep in mind it may tie your hands if you decide the franchise isn't for you and you want out, and the monthly payments may mean that you realize very little income in your first year of operation.  , The franchise agreement – which may be quite lengthy – provides details about exactly what you're buying when you buy the franchise, your duties and responsibilities to the brand and the franchise company, and the basic standards by which you must operate your business.The basic agreement gives you an idea of how much control the franchisor will have over your day-to-day operations and the management of your business. If the level of control goes beyond your comfort level, that might not be the right franchise for you. Make sure the franchisor is ready to substantiate any income projections or profit claims that are made to you while you're evaluating the work-at-home franchise. In addition to the basic agreement, the franchisor is legally obligated to provide you with a disclosure document, which provides you with important information about the current and former franchisees, the business background of the franchise system, as well as the bankruptcy and litigation history of franchise executives. Once you've reviewed all the paperwork, speak to someone in the franchise system and ask any questions you may have. In particular, you want to find out how long they've been in business, how many franchises are currently operating and where they're located, and what types of management or technical assistance the franchisor provides. If you have any questions about supplies, organization, and day-to-day operations, you want to ask these as well. Find out what restrictions there are, particularly in relation to your ability to advertise or promote your business.  , Some franchise agreements have early termination fees and other associated costs if you decide you want to quit before the end of your initial term. You need to know the cost of termination from the outset so you can develop a solid exit strategy.While it's important to have a reliable estimate of your start-up costs, it is perhaps just as important to know how much it will cost if you decide you want to close down your business. Check the term of the original agreement and look for a clause that discusses early termination. You also should review the requirements for renewing your agreement at the end of the term. Some franchisors exercise tremendous discretionary control over whether to approve a renewal.  , Some franchises may excel in some locations but be doomed to failure in others, whether due to a complete lack of demand or market saturation. The best opportunity is not a good opportunity for you if there's no interest in the products or services you plan to sell.Part of the reason you want to ask the franchisor where current franchises are located is to make sure there aren't too many located near you – this could point to a saturated market. At the same time, if there are no existing franchises anywhere near your county, or even in your state, this could decrease the value to you of the franchise. It's difficult to capitalize on the reputation of an established brand if no one in your area is familiar with it. When researching the market, you don't just want to look at that specific franchise, however – you also want to look at other companies providing the same or similar products or services. These companies will be your competitors, so it's important to find a way that your offerings will stand out as different from theirs, or you'll have a hard time getting your business off the ground.  , Even if the franchise looks good on paper, you still can learn from the experiences of people who have their own franchises – particularly those who were unable to make the franchise succeed for them.The company may give you the names and contact information of a few people, but you want to search for others as well. Those offered by the company likely are extraordinarily successful franchisors who have already been vetted and prepped by the company to respond to questions in a certain way. This doesn't mean you can't count on someone whose name was given to you by the company to be honest, but it does mean you should treat everything they say with a healthy dash of skepticism.

A company may claim itself that its products are ""fair trade"" without any independent evaluation of this claim. Keep in mind that there are no legally enforceable minimum standards you must meet to call your product ""fair trade,"" such as those that exist for certified organic products. Labels or symbols indicate that a product has been certified as fair trade by a particular independent organization.; , There is no universal or uniform body for evaluating the principals of fair trade, and different organizations have their own methods of evaluation and qualifications. There are three basic types of labeling organizations.Third party inspection and certification labeling organizations have the highest standards for fair trade. They typically conduct field inspections of growers or processing plants, and compare performance against a set of uniform standards. Membership organizations such as the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) and the Fair Trade Federation (FTF) evaluate the fair trade polices and practice of whole companies using set membership criteria, but do not inspect growers and processing plants themselves. Brand programs such as Whole Trade, the fair trade program for Whole Foods grocery stores, work with third-party inspectors and certify operations using their own brand standards regarding what qualifies as fair trade.  , Each organization has particular guidelines that must be met for products to be certified, including labor law and pricing standards.There are two basic certification standards that are generally recognized, and typically other organizations have some version of one of those, or a combination of both.The international Fair Trade Labeling Organization (FLO) is the oldest fair-trade certification body. The organization developed a number of verifiable indicators of fair trade practices, and are the best-known and most common certifier of agricultural products worldwide. A number of Western countries such as Canada have their own fair trade initiatives which are affiliated with the FLO and use the same standards. The Institute for Market Ecology (IMO), headquartered in Switzerland, is also a well-known and well-respected certifier of fair-trade and organic products. The IMO aims to be more universally applicable than the FLO standards, which typically require producers to be large-scale co-ops or plantations with hired workers. IMO standards, in contrast, allow distributors to purchase products from individual farmers, informal producer groups, and smaller collectives.  , The standards required by the labeling organization should extend to all actors involved in the trade of the product, and include not just employees but also contractors and sub-contractors.Label organizations that use FLO standards typically focus on the hired labor harvesting crops on plantations, with less focus on workers in processing, unless processing is organized by farmers' collectives. In contrast, IMO certifiers evaluate the pay and working conditions of all workers involved in the process of bringing the product to market. IMO certifiers also tend to include contract processors in their inspections, while FLO certifiers limit their evaluation to hired employees.  , Labeling organizations have different requirements – and different labels – to accompany products with several ingredients that are sourced from several producers.FLO certifiers require all ingredients to be certified for the final product to be certified. However, if certified ingredients are not available, at least 50 percent of the product must be fair-trade certified for the whole product to be granted a fair-trade label. If fewer than half of the ingredients are fair-trade certified, the product may carry a label on the front of the package indicating that it is made with a single fair-trade ingredient, or with a few fair-trade ingredients. Keep in mind that these ""fair trade lite"" labels often look exactly like the whole fair-trade certified labels, so with multi-ingredient products you must inspect the label closely. In contrast, IMO ""fair trade lite"" labels may only be carried on the back of the packaging – only whole-product fair-trade labels may be displayed on the front.  , Inspections for fair-trade certifications typically take around six months to complete, and labeling organizations charge fees for the inspection and licensing process that some companies cannot afford.FLO organizations charge inspection fees to producer groups and processors, plus licensing fees for the use of the logo to brands that sell FLO-certified products. IMO organizations charge inspection and certification fees, but do not charge licensing fees to brands that sell fair-trade certified products. The costs of inspection, certification, and licensing may be prohibitive to smaller companies selling items that actually are produced in sustainable ways with workers in fair working conditions being paid a living wage. Additionally, it requires many months of research and analysis for fair-trade organizations to determine fair prices for new crops or products. Although the FLO has a quick-entry program for new products that may fall within existing standards for other products, the organization still must analyze local market conditions to confirm the price is fair. In many cases, although producers or artisans may be paid a living wage, there simply isn't a certification system in place to evaluate the fair-trade standards for that particular product yet.  , If you have questions about how a product is produced or where it comes from and there's no label to assist you, the company may be able to provide some answers.Smaller companies and those that sell products produced by individual farmers or informal collectives may not have the funds or ability to have the products they sell fair-trade certified. Many such companies often have pages on their websites that describe how their products are made and the conditions of the workers who harvest and process them. You also may be able to find answers by calling the company's customer service number and asking about worker conditions. Ask what criteria the company uses to choose its suppliers, and how they verify working conditions and wages for the people who produce the products they sell. Producer organizations that trade directly with nonprofit organizations or other retail collectives may not be certified fair trade, but nevertheless achieve the same goals of finding solutions to poverty and empowering people in developing countries.  , Even if they aren't certified, many companies issue statements on the production standards of the items they sell. Nonprofit organizations such as Oxfam America also investigate and report on global labor and working conditions.Smaller suppliers or collectives may not themselves be certified, but may operate under the same criteria as a larger supplier nearby. Many nonprofits such as Catholic Relief Services have their own criteria to determine whether producers, artisans, and other partners follow fair trade principals and promote sustainable economic growth. Keep in mind that fair trade certification often doesn't apply to goods produced in Western countries, only those imported from the developing world.  , A number of nonprofit organizations as well as fair-trade labeling organizations have lists available online of products that are certified fair trade. Many fair-trade products distributed globally by smaller companies are only sold online.Websites such as fairtradefederation.org and transfairusa.org have lists of products and producers that are certified fair trade. If you're looking for fair-trade clothing, participating brands are more likely to be sold online than in brick-and-mortar stores. You also may be able to find better prices online if you buy directly from the company than if you purchase fair-trade products at a grocery store or other retail shop.  , Retailers may include a fair-trade label on their doors or on the front page of their website for marketing reasons. However, these labels don't guarantee that most – or even any – of that retailer's products are certified fair trade.Keep in mind that stores may continue to display a fair trade lego even though they no longer sell fair trade products. Similarly, stores may express a commitment to fair trade without actually selling certified products. Even if a store does sell fair-trade products, a logo doesn't mean that everything that store sells is fair trade. You still must verify from the product's packaging that each particular item was produced under fair-trade standards.  , If you want to see fair-trade products in your favorite store, fill out a comment card or speak directly to management and make your desires known.Keep in mind that a single voice may not be enough for a manager to start carrying a new product. Talk to your friends who also shop at that store, or circulate a petition in your community to demonstrate demand for fair-trade products. If the store is a chain, individual managers may not have much control over the products they carry. However, you can start a petition online and drum up support using social media to encourage the company to start carrying fair-trade products.  , If you're concerned about fair trade, buying the products you want or need directly from the artisans and growers provides the strongest assurance that everyone is being compensated fairly.Buy produce in season, and shop at your local farmer's market, rather than buying produce in the grocery store that was imported from developing countries. Connect with nonprofit organizations to buy clothing and housewares that are hand-made by artisans who are paid directly for the goods they produce. Find out if there's a co-op or other collective in your area that you can join to purchase locally sourced products from individual growers.

Don't worry about cut-outs for things like sinks right now: just get the shape of the rectangular or L shaped piece that you'll need. Try not to do anything to big all at once, as this will be very difficult to place. If you can, break it down into smaller sections.          Keep in mind that there is usually a 1"" overhang from the edge of the cabinets. Make sure to add this into measurements for any sides not attached to the wall.; , If you need to have a cutout for the sink, measure or trace the shape that you need onto some paper or cardboard. Then, transfer that shape to some high density, firm foam (like what is used in flower arranging) and cut it out.          This cardboard square will help your visualize the sink or other object and cut around it when preparing the countertop.  , Cut a base for your mold using the measurements that you took, but with 3/4"" added all the way around. You can cut the melamine using a table saw or similar tool.          For example, if making a countertop that is 25x60"" big, cut a piece of melamine that is 26 1/2"" x 61 1/2"".  , Cut the side pieces to the desired thickness of your countertop, plus 3/4"" on both ends and one of the sides to adjust for construction. Adjust the measurements for either the short or long ends, depending on how you want the boards to overlap. How this is done doesn't matter, just as long as they make the shape of the base.          For example, if you wanted 2"" thick countertops, the pieces would be cut to 2 3/4"" x 61 1/2"" for the long sides and 2 3/4"" x 26 1/2"" for the short sides. We could then adjust the measurement of the short sides to 25"" so that they can nest between the long side pieces. You could also go the opposite way, and adjust the long sides back down to 60"". Either way, test out your measurements with a tape measure on the melamine base to make sure everything will fit snugly.  , Using basic butt joints, drill pilot holes and then screw the sides of the mold together. You can then attach the sides to the base in the same way.          1 1/4 inch dry wall screws should be more than strong enough.  , Using rubber cement or another strong, even-drying adhesive, glue the foam cutout for your sink to the location it will go for the counter. You need to make sure the foam is as least as high as your mold. When you pour the concrete in, the foam needs to prevent any concrete from getting into the sink area.          If the sink will go at the edge of the counter, it might be better to simply build this into the mold, cutting it out ahead of time.  , Tape around the inside seams of the wooden mold, leaving just a slight gap (about 1/8"") between the two piece directly over the joints. You should then run a line of caulk along all the seams and form it to the joint using your finger. Allow it to dry and then peel off the tape. This will prevent any concrete from leaking out unattractively.          Use paper towels to wipe up any excess as you work.  , Use a carpenter's level to make sure the top edge of the form is level all the way around. If needed, sand it down to make sure it is all nice and uniform. When done, clean the mold with a shop vac and a damp cloth. Let it dry before moving on.         , This little trick greatly reduces the final weight, and the necessity for more concrete. Take some more foam and cut it to be only half the height of the mold. Then, leaving 1-2"" between the walls and foam, glue down the foam. It will take up a lot of the space the concrete would have, but is much, much lighter. When done, caulk it down to the mold.          Take up all the foam pieces together on both sides with packing tape, including the outside edges. Make sure you leave the gap around the edges -- you need to concrete around the entire perimeter.  , This helps for stability and shaping. You may need to cut and bend it a bit to fit it snugly into the molding. You don't want to add it in now -- you just want to make sure it fits.         , Use a mix for the color and additives that is especially designed for countertops or floors. This is important, as you'll want strengtheners and other filler materials to make your concrete function better for this purpose. You will also want to use a pre-mixed, high strength concrete. Your local home improvement store should be able to help you locate both of these products.          Mix the concrete in a moving mixer, in order to get the right volume and consistency. These can be rented from your local hardware store. You want a roughly peanut butter-like consistency. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for mixing the concrete and additives. Generally, less water is used for high strength concrete than normal concrete.  , Using a shovel or scoop, pour your concrete into the form until it reaches the top edge of the form all the way around. Use a trowel or paving tool to even out the top and push all of the concrete out to the sides as you work         , You can also add extra strength by cutting and placing a steel mesh in the wet concrete halfway through the pouring process, so that it is completely entombed in the material. This isn't completely necessary, but is important for preventing cracks and creating a countertop that will last a lifetime.         , Err on the side of having too much concrete in the form. You can always skim some off, but it is much harder to add in later.         , Using the edge of a flat board, lay it across the top of the form on one end and then slide it back and forth as you move down the frame to the opposite end. This will take off any extra concrete and make sure the top is level. You can use the edge of 2x4, or speciality concrete working tools. Work the edge back and forth along the top, like you are leveling floor in a measuring cup, to distribute the concrete evenly.          Take any excess concrete and use it to fill in any low spots. Extra concrete should be held onto for later, as it may help fill in spots.  , Vibrate the whole table your form is resting on if you can, but at a minimum gently vibrate the sides of the form to get rid of any bubbles. You can use a sander on a low setting, without any attachment, and run it along the entire edge of the form, for the easiest solution.          Your goal is to get an nice, even top. Even just lifting and dropping the whole table 2-3"" inches, bouncing it rapidly, is perfect. You can also use a rubber mallet, striking the sides of the mold and bottom of the table.  , Smooth everything out, then create a nice, rounded edge around the entire mold. Then trowel out any imperfections created by the edging tool, and let it sit.          Repeat this process again, especially the troweling, after 2-3 hours.  , Cover the concrete with plastic and then allow it to cure as long as instructed by the manufacturer. This could be anywhere from 1-2 days to a week. However, you don't want the concrete to completely dry. When you can press into it and only create a small dimple, you're ready to move forward.         , Unscrew the sides of the form and gently pry the melamine off of the concrete. If the concrete starts to slump, put it back on. If not, use your trowel to smooth out the outside edge of the counter into a clean, even surface.          If you need, a small spray of water makes the concrete a bit easier to work with. You won't need much. If a little concrete pulls off with the wall, you can trowel some of the excess concrete back on with a spritz of water.  , This final troweling provides some smoothness and character to your countertop. It is not entirely necessary, but will lead to a prettier countertop.         , You need the bottom of the countertop to dry, too. Once you're sure it is dried enough that it doesn't slump (in which case you would still have the side walls on, get a friend to help you raise the top of the countertop. Rip out the foam and pull off the molding, exposing the bottom of the counter top.          Don't rush this. Remember, the concrete should just barely indent under your finger. Let the countertop hang over the edge, at least slightly, to allow air underneath to dry.  , Put on some rubber gloves and then wipe down the countertop with a mixture of 10 parts water to 1 part muriatic acid to remove any remaining residue and prepare the material for sealing. Remove the excess acid with a squeegee.         , Using a sander and increasingly high grit sandpaper (120, 180, 220), sand your countertop and the sides until it is completely smooth. Remove the dust with a cloth and some water.         , If you want to color the concrete, add it after everything has dried. You can use any sort of coloring you want, as long as it is made for concrete.         , Using a penetrative sealer, fold a rag as flat as possible and then saturate it in the sealer. Wipe this in long strokes, overlapping each stroke with the next, until the entire counter is covered. Allow to dry. This usually takes around 2 hours.         , Use a food safe wax and a buffer to finish the countertops. When they're shiny and the wax is absorbed, you're good to go!         , Carefully place the countertops in their final location. If they are small enough not to stay in place using their own weight, use adhesives. Check for level and if they are not, use wood shims underneath to get the desired level.

While it's important to like the job you have, it's equally important to have some natural skill or talent for the type of work you're involved in.   Identify your ""motivated skills."" These include any skills you've actually enjoyed developing, even if you haven't had the opportunity to develop them much. When looking for new jobs, try to find an opening that will allow you to continue using and developing these abilities.The keyword, however, is ""skill."" If you aren't able to do the job correctly, both you and your new employer will be dissatisfied, no matter how much interest you have in the task.; , It's possible to get a good job at nearly any level of experience, but you probably won't get your “dream job” right away. Before you set your sights on your ideal, though, make sure that you can handle the path you'll need to travel on your way there.   For example, most successful authors have faced prolonged periods of financial strain, tedious self-improvement, obscurity, and rejection before achieving their status. If you aren't prepared to do likewise, you probably shouldn't make ""successful author"" your career goal., You can accept a job offer without determining whether or not you'll enjoy the work, but you should avoid dedicating large amounts of time or money to a certain career path before you've made that determination.   Don't be afraid of job hopping while you're searching for the right job, especially if you can demonstrate that each move actually follows along the same path. It's natural to quit when you realize you're in the wrong place, and sticking it out any longer than that is ultimately bad for both you and the company. Avoid going to graduate school if you're still uncertain about that field of study. The amount of time and money you'll spend will force you to look for high-paying work in that field simply for the sake of returning your investment and paying off your debt, even if you end up hating the field once you get into it.  , It's actually relatively common to quit your current job before finding new work, but before you hand in your resignation, you should make sure that you're in a position to stay financially afloat while you search for a new source of income.   If you hate your current job, it's better to quit sooner rather than later. Continuing to stay at that job can drain your energy and lower your self-confidence, making it more difficult to find a new job as time passes. On the other hand, make sure you can afford to quit. If you're unable to support yourself financially while you search for work, you'll feel rushed and may end up settling for another lousy position. If you don't have a current job or already quit your old one, consider looking for temporary work while you continue looking for permanent work. While there's no guarantee, the right contract or part-time position may even turn into a full-time job.  , If you've every searched for a job before, you've probably got the basics down. Oftentimes, though, the really great jobs won't be found in the places everyone else is looking, so you'll need to break away from these basics and try something new.   Skip generic job sites. It's possible to find a good job through these websites, but since they're so popular, they'll be flooded with poor jobs that don't relate to your desired field. Job sites that target your desired field or job type will give you a higher volume of higher-quality results. Search for a good company. A good work environment can be just as important as the tasks you'll perform at work. Search for companies that interest you, then look for reviews or ask current workers if they enjoy the experience there.  , Evaluate how much effort you're currently putting into the job search. If you aren't happy with the current results, you may need to search more actively and more often.Instead of calling five contacts each week, try to call an average of five contacts each day. Attend two to three times more networking events than you currently attend.  , The right position might exist somewhere outside your current city. Determine if relocation is a viable option, and if it is, broaden your search parameters to include jobs located in promising locations.   Research the city and state before blinding relocating, though. Some areas thrive more in times of economic downturn than others. Additionally, the cost of living in certain locations can be much higher than what you might be used to, so a higher paying job in these states might actually give you less financial support than a lower paying job in less demanding locations.  , Get on friendly terms with others who are currently looking for work. Share advice and experiences with one another, and consider passing along possible job opportunities when it seems appropriate.   For instance, if you spot a job opportunity that seems perfect for one of your allies, forward it along with a note of support. With any luck, your ally will return the kindness when the opportunity presents itself.  , Respond as soon as possible when you hear about a new job opportunity that might fit your needs. Don't let procrastination stand between you and your new career path.   As a general rule, you should apply for a job the same day you hear about the opening. If you need to contact someone about the position before you can submit your application, call that individual during normal business hours the following business day.  , You've probably read about the importance of a good resume countless times, but that's because it really is extremely important. Depending on the size of the company, an employer may see hundreds—or even thousands—of different resumes throughout the hiring period, so you'll need to make yours stand out if you want them to pay attention.   Brush up on the basics of making your resume before doing anything else. Yours needs to have some essential components before you work on the bells and whistles. You can tweak your resume by changing the font type and color, or by printing it on nice stationary. If you feel especially daring, you can try creating an infographic resume or an Internet landing page that can serve as an interactive resume.Regardless of the format used, you should avoid redundant phrasing. You may also need to tweak your resume based on the job you're applying for to better highlight your applicable skills.  , If you're fortunate enough to get called in for an interview, you need to make the interview a success from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave.   Your appearance will be the first thing the hiring manager notices about you. Business casual is usually a safe bet, but it's better to call the company beforehand and specifically ask about the dress code for the interview. Prepare to answer common questions. Research some common interview questions and learn about the intent behind those questions. You don't need to create a script for yourself, but you should practice answering some of the usual questions beforehand so you can present an impressive answer. Converse as naturally as possible. While you should always answer the questions asked to you, don't recite off your answers like a machine. Try to develop the tone of the interview into a professional yet natural conversation. Doing so makes you seem more likable and more confident., You should follow up with a company twice after the interview. Express your gratitude the first time and inquire about the position during the second time.   Your first follow-up should happen immediately. Try to send an email or make a phone call the same day as your interview. Your second follow-up should happen three days to one week after the interview. If you haven't heard back from the company by then, call and ask if you're still being considered for the position.  , Very few people land the first job they apply for. Everyone will get rejected. When it happens to you, accept the rejection gracefully and quickly move beyond it.   Accepting rejection means accepting that rejection is part of the process without adopting the attitude of a reject. Instead of despairing and lowering your sights, keep pressing forward along the path you've set for yourself.  , Conventional advice tells you to bend over backwards pleasing a prospective employer, but in reality, issuing one-sided and unconditional respect to a prospective employer without demanding some basic level of respect in return will probably lead you to a miserable work environment.   Everyone has his or her own breaking point, but as a general rule, look for potential employers that stick to their promises and commitments. If you were promised a phone call by Wednesday and you don't hear back until the following Tuesday, it could suggest that the company doesn't value its employees' time or needs. As a result, the working environment might easily devolve into a negative one.  , You probably know what you don't want in a job, but you won't be able to know if a job is “good” based on that alone. Focus on the positive qualities of a potential offer instead of fixating only on an absence of negative qualities.   Think about the times you've enjoyed work in the past and ask yourself what circumstances made that enjoyment possible. Ask yourself if this new job offer can create circumstances similar to those.  , The highest paying job is not necessarily the best job—in fact, it may not even be a “good” job in terms of overall satisfaction. Make sure that you can earn enough to support yourself, but don't assume that more money equals more happiness.More money isn't always a bad thing, of course, but you need to weigh it against other factors. For instance, you'll probably be better off in a job that meets your financial needs at 40 hours a week than you would be with a job that pays 15% more but demands 60 hours a week, especially if the two jobs are similar in scope.  , Many jobs come with small perks that seem more significant than they actually are. When evaluating each supposed benefit, ask yourself if it's truly important before factoring it into your decision.Unnecessary perks usually include special privileges, titles, and status. In other words, being the ""First"" Assistant Manager isn't necessarily better than being a ""Secondary Assistant Manager"" unless the pay and responsibilities reflect the change in title. Similarly, use of the company car probably won't mean much to your long-term job satisfaction, so it ultimately shouldn't weigh into your decision.  , No job is perfect. Even if you land a good job, you will undoubtedly have the occasional bad day at work. To that end, you shouldn't necessarily decline a job offer on the basis of one or two small flaws.   Similarly, you shouldn't assume that a job will be perfect just because it seems to be from the outside looking in. Both employers and employees present their best sides during the hiring process, so there are bound to be a few downsides you weren't aware of. Always maintain a realistic perspective before accepting any job to avoid major letdowns once you start working.

Depending on the kind of learning you want your dog to experience, you will have very different needs for a trainer. Some trainers specialize in improving the behavior of adult fear aggressive dogs, whereas others are better with open minded puppies.   For instance, perhaps you need to tame a fearful or aggressive dog, or your dog has ongoing difficulty with separation anxiety. These issues require a professional with specialized training in these areas that can give your dog one-on-one attention. You may need to train a new dog or a puppy, which should inform the type of trainer you choose. A dog training facility that holds group puppy classes would be a good place to start.; , Consider which of your friends or family members has the most experience with dog training. Ask them to have coffee with you and share their dog training experiences. Perhaps they will have general tips or specific recommendations on good dog trainers for your needs.You can say, ""Bob, your dog is a pleasure to be around. Did you work with a trainer that you would recommend?""  , Go to the dog park and observe interactions between dogs and their owners. When the owner makes a request or issues a command to their dog, look at how the dog responds. First, see whether the dog obeys the command or not. Second, consider how the dog obeys the command. Look for signs that the dog has been trained with punitive or positive methods:If the dog responds to the request with their tail between their legs and their eyes averted, they may have been trained with punitive methods. This is not a sign of good dog training. If the dog responds with their tail and their ears pointed up and with a cheerful demeanor, it is a sign that positive reward training was used. This is a sign of good dog training.  , Look around at the dogs in your life or in your neighborhood. If a friend comes over with their dog and it looks well behaved, ask who trained it. And if you are at the park and see an especially well behaved dog, ask the individual where they went for dog training.If they look like they would be open for conversation, try asking: “Excuse me, sir, I notice that your dog is especially well behaved. I am actually looking for a dog trainer right now, so I was wondering if you could share with me which trainer you used. Thanks so much for your time.”  , Although veterinarians are not necessarily specialists in dog training, they are often well connected to dog behaviorists and trainers. They may be able to give you a good recommendation for a trainer that meets your needs., Compile the list of dog trainers you have found by talking to friends, family members, your veterinarian and observing well behaved dogs. Now that you have a shortlist of possible candidates in your area, you can begin figuring out which trainers would be most appropriate for you.  , There is no universally acknowledged standardization for dog trainers. However, there are a variety of certifications for behaviorists of various kinds as well as independent dog trainer certifications, which require varying levels of education and experience. Requirements range from a doctoral degree and five years of clinical experience to trainers who have passed exams and a minimum of three hundred hours of training experience. Ask potential trainers about their training and experience:Veterinary behaviorists are vets themselves who have finished a two-year residency with a board-certified veterinarian. They are certified with the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists (ACVB). Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists have a PhD and five years of clinical experience. Associate Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists have a Master’s degree and clinical experience. Applied Animal Behaviorists have graduate level education in a field related to animal behavior. Trainers certified with the Certification Council for Pet Dog Trainers have 300 hours of experience, passed a 250 question exam, and must undergo recertification every three years. Trainers certified by the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC) have finished three years and 1,500 hours of consulting work as well as 500 hours of dog training related education. Many titles are used such as dog psychologist or behavior specialist but these do not necessarily mean anything if there is no related certification., You should ask the potential dog trainers whether they use humane training methods that rely on positive reinforcement. Also, ask whether punitive techniques like shock collars, choking, shaking, tugging, yelling or alpha rolling are used. If the trainer uses punitive techniques, you may want to look elsewhere because these are no longer considered humane., You should find out their previous experience working with your specific breed and size of dog. Also, you should inquire into whether they have worked with dogs with similar behavioral issues and personality. Consider asking:“Have you ever trained large mixed breed dogs like mine?” “Have you ever trained fear aggressive dogs that are very difficult like mine?” “Do you know much about small, shy dogs?” “Do you prior experience with English cocker spaniels?” “What is your background when it comes to training labradoodles?”  , You should inquire into the type of training equipment that they use such as collars, leashes, harnesses, toys, clickers and other tools. You may want to ask whether they use a slip or choke collar, especially since these are controversial tools and, if not used properly, can injure a dog. See if they use newer, safety collars or even classic collars which tend to be safe.Safety collars eliminate the risk of choking, since they release if there is too much pressure. Buckle collars are great for everyday use. They connect with a buckle. Head halters are used when a dog has a hard time with obedient walking with a regular collar. E-collars are used to control a dog in an enclosed area. If your dog tends to pull you when you walk, you might ask whether they front-clip harnesses which can help solve this problem., Food treats can be used very effectively to train dogs, since they are a reward that dogs are born to love. However, food treats can also be used as bribery during the training process, which will initiate a pattern that can be difficult to break once established. Ask the trainer how they get dogs to do the work prior to seeing the reward, since the key is for the food treat to be invisible until the reward is offered.   “How do you use food treats to train dogs?” “Do you ever use bribes?” “How do you use food as a reward in the training process? Can you give an example?”  , You want to find out if they rely solely on food treats or if other rewards are used such as toys, snuggle time or praise. A good trainer will use different types of rewards, so find out what the trainer has up their sleeve for reward based training., Once you have had a good conversation with the trainer and determine that they use positive reinforcement, appropriate rewards and have a solid level of education and experience, you may want to observe their work. Ask if you can observe one of their dog training classes or individual sessions. When observing the trainer with the dogs, consider whether the trainer uses solid teaching techniques, shows care and attention to the dogs and seems knowledgeable., Inquire into the cost of individual training sessions for your dog as well as kennel school programs. Depending on the education and experience level of the trainer, the price will vary significantly. Based on this inquiry, determine which trainer you can afford.   Individual training costs in the range of $30-$100 per hour. Dogs with behavioral issues will cost at least $100 per hour. You can purchase packages of dog training sessions, with prices ranging from #240-$600 for six sessions. Kennel schools for four to six weeks cost in the range of $1000-$2500.Try not to choose a dog trainer on cost alone. An expensive trainer may be well-worth the cost when it comes to results and potentially save you money in the long run.  , See how your dog responds to the trainer. If you notice your dog is scared, they may not be the right trainer for your dog. However, if your dog looks excited, cheerful, wags their tail or shows other positive signs, you may have found the right trainer for your dog.  , Review your list of potential dog trainers and consider which candidates are best suited for training your dog. You should consider their education, experience, background with your breed, humane training methods and use of food and training equipment. You may also want to consider convenience or, in other words, whether they can train your dog at your home or whether you have to drive to a distant location. Then, consider the list of candidates based on affordability. Choose the best suited dog trainer that you can afford.  , You should consider whether the trainer is actually teaching your dog what you want your dog to learn. If the dog trainer is teaching your dog appropriate content that relates to your goals for them, it is likely a good fit. If they are not teaching your dog the skills and behavior changes you are looking for, you may need to find a new trainer., You should consider the quality and amount of attention that your dog trainer gives you and your dog. If the dog trainer is very talented but too busy to give quality attention to training your dog, misses or reschedules appointments, perhaps it is time to change trainers. However, if the trainer is busy but still manages to devote quality attention to your dog, you may want to stick with them., You should assess whether the trainer is using the positive training methods and tools they advertised. Watch them train your dog and see if they are using appropriate rewards, quality training tools like leashes and dog toys or clickers. Consider the following factors in your decision:If they are using choke collars or prongs to punish your dog, you should find a new trainer. If they are describing your dog as being “dominant,” you should inquire further to find out whether the trainer is using punitive techniques. The word “dominant” to describe your dog may indicate a misdiagnosis and could be associated with punitive, old school training approaches. If they use the term “pack leader,” they may be an old school trainer using punitive techniques. You may want to look elsewhere.
