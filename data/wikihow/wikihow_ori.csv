Most fireplace mantel shelves are placed 50-60 inches above the floor. When positioning your shelf, make sure to think about the combustible height. Since wood is a combustible  material, there are codes and guidelines that must be followed when placing a mantel over a combustible chamber, such as a fireplace.   If a mantel is 10"" wide, the minimum distance from the top of the fireplace is usually 19"". For an 8"" wide mantel, the distance is 17"", and for 6"" it's 15"".After levelling the shelf, draw a line on the wall that corresponds to the edge of the mantel. Make a mark in the direct center of your fireplace. You want to make sure your mantel isn't one-sided.  , The cleat is what holds the mantel shelf to the wall. The mounting board should be long enough to fit the width of your shelf.   Measure the length of the cleat. Then, using that measurement, find the center line and mark that on the cleat. You will line this mark up with the mark you made on the wall in Step 1. The top of the cleat needs to have an angled edge, not a straight edge. Take a saw and cut a 45 degree angle lengthwise along one edge of the cleat. This is what the mantel hangs on. Dry-fit the angled edge of the cleat into the mantel. Make sure they fit snugly together so that the mounting board will support the mantel. If you do not want to saw an angled edge, you can use a flat edged cleat. Make sure your cleat is wide enough for the mantel to be fastened to the cleat with screws.  , Dry-fit the mounting board into the mantel. Using a tape measure, measure the length from the top edge of the mantel to the bottom edge of the cleat. Draw a second line beneath the line drawn on the wall from Step 1 using the measurement you just took.   If you do not want to measure the two pieces together, measure the length of the mantel and the length of the cleat. Add those two measurements together to determine how far to draw the second line beneath the first line.  , When you hang a mantel, you want to make sure that you hang the object on the studs. For a mantel shelf, you will probably have 3 studs.The easiest way to find a wall stud is to use a stud finder, which can be purchased from a local home improvement store.   In most houses, studs are spaced 16"" apart. Studs are usually 1.5"" in width. When you attach the shelf to the stud, you need to drill or nail into the middle of the stud, which is 3/4"" from the edge. If you don't have a stud finder, try finding an electrical outlet on the wall. One side of the electrical outlet will be nailed to the stud. To locate which side the stud is on, use the heel of your hand and gently knock the wall on each side of the outlet. The side without the stud will sound hollow, while the side with the stud won't. After you have determined the side with the stud, measure 3/4"" from the side of the electrical outlet. This will be the center of the stud. Using a tape measure, you can mark the studs along the wall every 16"".  , Align the flat, bottom edge of the cleat with the bottom line. Make sure the cleat is level before you attach it to the wall.   If you are attaching the shelf to brick, try for around 5 screws.If you are attaching the shelf to dry wall, drill or nail into the studs. Drill holes into the wood before you fasten it to the wall. This helps the wood not to split., If you are using an angled cleat, fit the shelf over the mounting board, making sure the shelf fits tightly against the wall. Make sure the shelf is level.   If you are using a flat cleat, fit the shelf over the mounting board. Then, fasten the shelf to the cleat along the back edge near the wall. You can either attach the mantel to the cleat using nails or screws. When attaching the mantel, you want to try to drill or nail in the center of the side of the cleat.

The room must be at least a 4x4 to ensure there will be enough room., The first cheat you will enter is ""testingcheatsenabled true"", without the quotations. Keep in mind that while caps don't matter, spacing does. The second cheat you'll need to enter is ""buydebug on"".  Note: This cheat will only work with a stuff pack or expansion installed into your game.  , Under tomb objects is a stone sarcophagus, (a coffin holding mummies). Under miscellaneous are two fancier sarcophagus'. Place the sarcophagus of your choosing into the designated room, being sure not to block the door. Then, under tomb objects is a special torch. Under the lights you can find a torch but this torch is different because it's also a lever.  Note: the lever needs to be outside of the room for the murder to work.  , This is where it gets tricky. Hold down the keys ctrl + shift and click on the sarcophagus while holding down those buttons. Not too hard right? A list will come up asking you different things. Click Set Mummy Chance and then select Always.  Note: The Set Mummy Chance option may be under the option More at the top of the list. Now, when the sarcophagus is opened a mummy will come out. Next, shift + ctrl + click the torch lever and select Enable Lever. Now your Sim has the ability to pull the lever.  , It wouldn't be murder if your Sim accidentally opened the tomb. But there's a way to fix that problem. Ctrl + shift + click the torch lever again. Now select Link Triggers  and Add Link Trigger, then select Pull Lever. Now ctrl + shift + click the sarcophagus and select Link to Activated Behavior. Select Open. To check it was done properly, simply click one of the objects. A pink or green line should appear, connecting the two. This means there was success., Give the victim the queue to walk into the room. Then click on the door and select Lock and Everybody. You need your game fully updated to do this, if your game isn't fully updated or you can't get it to work simply go into buy mode and remove the door. Your victim has now been locked into the room., Have your murderer Sim now simply pull the lever, releasing the tomb mummy on your Sim's victim. The mummy will walk out and most likely curse the Sim with the mummy's curse, which will kill the Sim if not cured. If your Sim victim wins the fight or survives, simply repeat the process until they are cursed., Yes, sadly you do have to wait for this one, but they will die. What makes this murder is the fact your Sim's actively participating in the murder by pulling the lever that unleashes the mummy. This is a great way to have murder on your Sim, or simply get rid of the in-laws.","['sims', 'victim sim', 'room', 'cheats', 'sim', 'traps', 'release tomb mummy', 'lot', 'trap']"

Don't assume that allergies aren't real or that your friend can just take a Benadryl before coming over. Ask your friend if he or she minds talking to you about their allergy and explain that you're trying to understand more about how to change your habits. Learn about the symptoms, and support your friend in learning more about his or her health by visiting an allergist. If there's a kind of cleaning or air filtering you can try to make your house accessible to your friend, try it!  , How many of their other friends and family have pets? How many people can they visit aside from you? Try to understand how your decision to get a pet will, or did, make your friend's life more restricted, and consider how much she or he relied on your home as a place to hang out and connect with their social scene.  , See whether some of your pet-free friends would mind hosting extra dinners, brunches and parties so that your allergic friend can come too. Talk about whether you can occasionally use other friends' homes as ""emergency"" places to meet the allergic friend, even if the homeowner isn't there (in cases of breakups, crises, or other times when you or your allergic friend really want to see each other and not in a public place). You could even consider splitting the cost of ""renting"" a friend's pet-free living room or spare room for a small amount (someone who needs the cash!), getting a spare key, and using that as a home-away-from-home every so often for you and your allergic friend.  , How do they feel? Give the friend a chance to be angry and sad, and take their feelings seriously - while you do love your pet, your decision to have it in your home is keeping a beloved human out of your home. This can be especially sad if you're very close and/or have known each other for a long time. Don't let them feel like you're just paying lip-service; let them know that their reactions and worries are changing how you approach the situation. Act on what they say. Come back with ideas and thoughts on how to adjust. Ask them for their own ideas.  , Do it more often than you would have pre-pet, since no one succeeds in making contact, or making plans, every time they try. Try to actually talk to your friend and see your friend as much as you did pre-pet, even if it means harassing them a bit (in a friendly way, of course!) Your friend will be much happier if you harass them for hangout time than if they have to harass you. Let them know you still love and care about them, despite the new obstacle.  , Go to the friend's house to make dinner and watch movies. Hanging out on a couch or in a kitchen can be irreplaceable for close friends, especially friends you've known since you were young. Sometimes you want to listen to music, work in the same room, do projects or watch TV - all very different activities than face-to-face conversation over a meal or drink. Even though you may still have this type of socializing in your life and may not miss it (with people who aren't allergic to your pet) your friend might find him or herself going to a lot of dinners and coffee dates, and will really appreciate the home time.  , Get out of town for the weekend sometimes and get out of your pet-avoiding patterns. Make an annual tradition of going to a cabin, a nearby city, etc.  , If something is off-limits to your friend, consider hanging out with your friend before or after, or even skipping the party. See if the allergic friend has plans or will be home alone. If there's nothing you can do, at least you can tell your friend that you're sad they can't be there!  , Sometimes they might need to talk to someone, or might just be lonely, especially if there are a lot of people they can't visit. Talk to your friend about ways to do this - maybe a system where you distinguish between making normal plans and more 'urgent' plans. Or find a place near your house if your friend is in the neighborhood and wants to 'drop by.' If your friend invites you out, make an effort to go.  , Close friendships are just as important (if not more!) as dating relationships and family. Make life plans! Tell your friend if you plan to have pets for the rest of your life, and discuss how that changes the way you envision your friendship. Did you always talk about raising kids in the same city? Going on family trips? Visiting each other if you have to move apart? Hopefully you can work it out. Don't leave your friend wondering if you're going to get sick of dealing with the allergy, or too busy.  , Unlike many other relationships, friendships are based entirely on unconditional love, trust and support; without those things, the friendship doesn't really exist. So if you can't provide those things, now or in the future, talk to your friend about it. It's up to you to make that decision, and it's ok that you really love your pet: just give your friend a chance to make his or her own life decisions in a respectful, timely way.

Begin gently petting its paws while simultaneously petting the cat in its favorite spots (the back of the neck, under the chin, where its back meets its tail, etc.). Do this for each paw you plan to trim. The cat might pull its paws away, or even get up and walk away. Let it go; don't force it to do anything, but continue to gently pet its paws when you have the opportunity. Whenever you handle your cat’s paws, reward it with treats and praise to help build positive associations.; , Once your cat is comfortable enough to allow you to rest your hand on its paws without pulling away, start to gently hold its paws in your open hand.   Place your hand over the cat’s paw, then flip your hand around so the bottom of the cat's paw is on the palm of your hand. Keep rewarding the cat with petting and treats; give the cat a new, special treat that will only be associated with cutting its claws.  , After your cat grows accustomed to you holding its paws, start holding the paws and massaging them with your fingers.Gently massage your fingers over the tops and bottoms of each paw you plan to trim. Reward your cat with more treats and praise.  , Eventually, you should be able to gently squeeze the paws (applying most of the pressure on the pads) to push individual claws out without upsetting your cat.When your cat’s claws are extended, you’ll see the thick part of the nail, and, towards the cat’s toe, a pinkish area inside the nail, called the quick. The quick is the living part of the nail and contains blood vessels and nerves, so cutting a cat’s nail to the quick is quite painful for the cat. Never cut a cat's nail close to or with flush with the toe; your aim is to clip off only the sharp point.Look carefully at where and how large each quick is--through a clear nail it will look like a small pink triangle. Each of your cat’s nails will be similar, so even if the cat has dark nails, look to find one clear nail as a reference point for the others.  ,   If you're going to be trimming the cat's nails by yourself, the cat will need to sit on its rear on your lap, facing away from you, while you hold its paw with one hand (and, eventually, the clippers with the other). Practice having your cat sit this way and hold each of its paws. Gently press on each nail to extend it. Again, reward the cat with treats and praise.If you have someone to help, they can hold the cat facing you, or they can cradle it, while you hold the paw with one hand (and, eventually, clip with the other). Practice having your assistant hold your cat while you hold each of its paws and gently press each claw until your cat seems comfortable. Reward it with treats and praise.  , You can't trim your cat’s nails whenever you feel like it. You should pick a time when your cat is feeling nice and relaxed, such as when it's just coming out of a nap, getting ready to nap, or calmly resting on its favorite surface during the day.Another good time for nail trimming is after your cat has eaten and is feeling sleepy and content. Don't try to trim your cat's nails right after play time, when it’s hungry, when it's restless and running around, or in an otherwise aggressive mood. The cat will be far from receptive to you trimming its nails. You may see that your cat has a broken or splitting nail and will want to cut it instantly, but don’t. Make a note of it and wait for your cat to get relaxed before trying to cut it, or you could make it worse.  , Before sitting down to cut your cat’s nails, be sure you have the right equipment to do so. To trim your cat's nails, you’ll need a pair of nail clippers designed to clip cat claws and a styptic pencil.There are several different styles of nail clippers, all of which largely do the same job. The most important thing is that the clippers are sharp, so they snip straight through the claw. Not only will using dull clippers make the job longer and harder, you may end up squeezing the quick, which can be painful for the cat. There are two primary styles of clipper: scissor and guillotine clippers. Scissor clippers cut a cat’s nails using a scissor motion and usually come in small and large sizes. The small “nippers” tend to be better for those new to clipping nails or if you just need to snip the tips. Larger scissor clippers are suited to cutting older, tougher nails. Guillotine clippers use a sliding blade that cuts the nail when you squeeze the handles together. The claw fits into a slot and the blade slides across to clip the nail. These are strong clippers that are good for cutting long, thick nails (but not overgrown nails--large clippers are better suited to that). If the clippers are sharp the cat won't feel the quick clip. Clippers don't stay sharp forever, so discard them (or send them for sharpening) if you suspect the blades have gone dull. Signs of this include having to apply a lot of pressure to cut the nail or the nail being “chewed” by the clippers rather than making a clean cut. Also have a styptic pencil on hand in case you cut the cat’s quick (which is less likely with a cat than a dog, as the cat's quick is much shorter). Styptic pencils are readily available from pharmacies (typically in the shaving section). They cauterize blood vessels when touched to the nail and help prevent bleeding. If you cut the quick, you can hold the styptic pencil to the claw for 1 - 2 minutes and the bleeding should stop.  , Gently squeeze the top and bottom of your cat’s paw, on the joint just behind the claw to extend the claw., Be sure you know where the quick is before you attempt to cut the nail--the quick will look like a small, pinkish triangle inside the nail.   You should first cut just the tip of the nails, and as you get more comfortable, you can cut closer to the quick, but never cut all the way to the quick or you can hurt your cat and make its nails bleed.  , Hold the cat as described earlier and cut the nails one by one. Position the trimmers halfway between the end of the quick and the claw.   Try to orient the clippers so that when the nail is cut, the blade cuts from bottom to top. This will help prevent splitting. Try to avoid getting frustrated. Your cat may protest, meow, and try to scratch you, but don't yell at your cat or rush through the process, or you may end up hurting it and scaring it away having its nails trimmed again. You may only be able to trim one or two nails at a time at first.  , It’s been a good sport about letting you cut its nails and should be rewarded for enduring it.   Make the treat special: vacuum-packed salmon, or chicken. Some cats also like sour cream or butter. Using a special treat ensures that your cat begins to associate this treat with getting its nails trimmed. So though your cat may not love the nail-trimming part, it'll want the treat afterwards, so it'll be less resistant in the future.  , Each cat's nails grow at a different rate, but it's a good rule of thumb to trim your cat's nails somewhere between every two weeks and every month so that its nails don't get too long, split, or break.   Though your cat will be sharpening its claws and keeping them in good shape on its own, keep an eye on their nails nonetheless. Your cat could be walking around with a broken nail, and you can help it out by trimming it into shape. Older cats need special attention because their nails are thicker and can sometimes press around into the pads, cutting into them. Check your older cat's nails every week and clip the tip off if necessary. This is much easier than letting the nails get overgrown, which can cause them to impact into the pads. If this happens, the cat will need to see a veterinarian because antibiotics may be necessary., Don't get a stranger or relative stranger to help you trim your cat's nails or your cat will be even more scared.   Though it sounds good and fine to get your cat used to having its nails trimmed, the reality is, many cats will still protest every single time, and you may have to get some extra help to do it.  , You can both try standing on opposite sides of a raised surface, like a counter.   Both of you should talk calmly and reassuringly to the cat. Have your helper pet the cat and try to keep it in place by holding on to its body without hurting it or scaring it too much. If your cat enjoys being brushed, the other person can brush the cat to distract it from the fact that it's getting its nails trimmed. Have your helper brush the cat’s head, under its neck, or in other places where it enjoys being brushed.  , While holding the paw, push down on the pad to extend the claws.   If your cat is being rowdy, wait for it to settle down so that you can isolate the paw.  , Your helper will continue to distract the cat while you trim its claws.   Just follow the directions in the previous section to make sure you give your cat a smooth, painless nail trim. When you're done, reward your cat with a nice treat.  , Every cat's nails will grow at a different rate, but it's good practice to trim your cat's nails somewhere between every two weeks and every month so that its nails don't get too long, split, or break.

"['go to the gym when it is not too crowded', 'meet with a personal trainer', 'allow yourself some time to adjust', 'remind yourself that people are focused on themselves', ""try to admire people's fitness rather than be jealous"", 'consider switching to a different gym']",How to Reduce Self Consciousness when Exercising2," Going to the gym during peak hours may cause you to feel more self-conscious because there will be lots of other people around. Instead, try going to the gym during off hours, such as late in the evening or early in the morning.   Ask a gym employee what the peak hours are at your gym so that you can avoid them. If you prefer to exercise outside, then try exercising at night or early in the morning when fewer people are out., You might feel self-conscious if you don't know how to use the machines or if you are not sure what exercises to try. To deal with this type of self-consciousness, try setting up a meeting with personal trainer at your gym. A personal trainer can teach you how to use the machines properly and help you develop a set of exercises that you can do when you come to the gym.Many gyms offer a free one-on-one consultation with a trainer so that you can learn how to use the machines. Ask at your gym if they offer something like this.  , If you have just started working out, then it is normal to feel a bit self-conscious. You are doing something new and that can cause anxiety. That is why it is important to give yourself some time to adjust to the new activity before you decide that it is not for you.For example, if you have just started working out at a gym, then give yourself a few weeks to adjust to the new environment and people. If you are just starting an outdoor exercise program, it may also take a few weeks to feel comfortable walking around your neighborhood.  , It is normal to feel self-conscious, and many people experience these feelings. Even people who seem like they are totally comfortable at the gym may be feeling self-conscious. Try to remind yourself that people are more focused on themselves than they are on you.Even when you are exercising outside, people passing by in their cars or on foot are likely thinking about their own problems and are probably not paying much attention to you.  , If you struggle with jealousy when you are at the gym, then this may be feeding your self-consciousness. To combat jealousy, try to focus on what you admire about the fit people at your gym.For example, when you are feeling jealous of someone, you might think to yourself, ""Wow! I admire her ability to do so many pull-ups. She must be incredibly strong!"" Or, ""Amazing! He has been running on the treadmill since I arrived at the gym! I admire his endurance.""  , If you feel so uncomfortable at your gym that you dread going to it, then it might not be the right gym for you. Consider looking for a different gym if you still don’t feel comfortable at your gym after a few weeks.Try looking for a gym that caters to your needs. For example, if you are a woman, then there are gyms that are for women only. Or, you could look into a gym that offers classes and help to people of all fitness levels.

Define the mistake. Did you say something wrong? Did you accidentally make a mistake on a project at work or at school? Did you forget to clean the bathroom like you promised? Understand how and why you made the mistake. Did you do it on purpose and then later regret it? Were you simply not paying enough attention? Think to yourself something like, ""How did I forget to clean the bathroom? Did I not want to clean it and avoid it? Did I get too busy?"" If you are not sure what you did wrong, ask someone (friend, family member, teacher, co-worker, boss) to help you find out. For example, if someone is upset at you, you can ask,""I sense that you are upset with me, can you explain?"" This person may then say, ""I'm upset with you because you said you would clean the bathroom and you didn't do it.""; , Are there other times when you forgot to do something?   Write down any patterns or themes you notice that keep coming up for you. This may help you identify a larger goal that you need to work on (attention span, certain skills, etc). For example, perhaps you tend to forget tasks that you don't want to do such as cleaning. This could indicate you are avoiding the task or that you need to become more organized in order to remember to complete certain responsibilities.  , Understand that your mistake is your own. Take the responsibility that is yours and avoid blaming it on someone else.If you play the blame-game then you cannot learn from your faults, and you may continue making the same mistakes over and over again.   Write down the parts of the problem that you contributed to, or the specific mistake you made. Identify things you might have done differently to produce a better outcome.  , One of the best ways to solve a problem or mistake is to identify how you have solved similar problems or mistakes in the past. Think thoughts such as, ""I have remembered things in the past, how did I do that? Oh yeah, I wrote them down in my calendar and checked it several times a day!""   Make a list of similar mistakes you've made. Identify how you dealt with each mistake and if it benefited you or not. If it didn't then it probably won't work.  , In the current example, there are many options: you could clean the bathroom, apologize, offer to clean another part of the house, negotiate, plan to do it the following day, etc.   Use your problem-solving skills to think of possible solutions to your current issue. Create a pros and cons list for each possible solution. For example, if you identified that one possible solution to your issue of forgetting to clean the bathroom is to make sure to clean it tomorrow, a pros and cons list might look like this: Pros - the bathroom will get clean eventually, Cons - it will not be clean today, I might forget tomorrow (I can't completely ensure that it will get done), it doesn't help to solve my problem of forgetting to clean the bathroom. Based on this assessment, it may be better to clean the bathroom the same day if possible, and develop a plan to remember to clean it in the future.  , In order to fix the problem you must have a plan. Identify the best possible solution based on the past and available options and commit to carrying it out.Follow through. If you make a promise to fix the problem, do it. Being dependable is important in building trust with others and forming lasting relationships. , No matter how foolproof the plan is, there is a possibility it won’t fix the issue. For example, you may clean the bathroom but the person who asked you to clean it could still be upset with you.   Identify other possible solutions and write them down from most helpful to least helpful. Go down the list from top to bottom. The list might include things like: offer to clean another room, apologize profusely, ask the person how he wants you to make up for it, or offer the person something he enjoys (food, activities, etc).  , If you can successfully find a solution to your error, then you are beginning the process of success in the future and avoidance of mistakes.Write down what you think you did wrong. Then write down a goal of what you want to do in the future. For example, if you forgot to clean the bathroom you could identify goals such as: write down a list of tasks each day, check the list twice per day, check off the tasks once they are finished, and put reminder post-its on the fridge for top priority tasks.  , Understand that it is okay to make mistakes. You may feel guilty but it is important to accept yourself in spite of your weaknesses.Forgive yourself and move on instead of dwelling on your issue. Focus on doing better now and in the future.  , When we make a mistake it is easy to get frustrated, overwhelmed, or give up altogether. If you are feeling overly emotional or stressed, take a break. It won't benefit you to try to fix your mistake if your emotions are heightened.  , Focus on ways of coping with negative emotions that may make you feel better. Think about ways you have coped with making mistakes in the past. Identify ways you have coped well and ways you coped that made you feel worse.   Some common coping strategies for dealing with mistakes include: positive self-talk (saying nice things about yourself), exercise, and relaxing activities such as reading or playing a game. Some unhelpful ways of coping with mistakes include engaging in self-destructive behaviors such as: using alcohol or other substances, harming the self physically, ruminating, and thinking negatively about the self.  , Using assertive communication skills means saying how you think and feel in a respectful and appropriate way.When you are assertive, you admit when you are wrong and take ownership of your personal faults. You do not blame others for your mistakes.   Avoid passivity, which involves avoiding talking about it, hiding, going along with what everyone wants you to do, and not standing up for yourself. Do not be aggressive, including: raising your voice, yelling, belittling, cursing, and violent behaviors (throwing things, hitting). Avoid being passive-aggressive. This is a mix between passive and aggressive forms of communication where you may be upset but not be forthcoming with your feelings. Therefore, you may do something behind someone’s back to get revenge or give them the silent treatment. This is not the best form of communication and the person may not understand what you are trying to communicate or why. Send positive nonverbal messages. Our nonverbal communication sends messages to the people around us. A smile says, “Hey, I should be frowning, but I can be brave and get through this thing.""  , Let the person that is upset vent his frustrations and wait to respond.Try to focus solely on listening to the person instead of thinking about how to respond. Focus on the other person's feelings and thoughts instead of your own. Make summary statements and ask clarifying questions, such as, ""I hear you saying that you are angry because I forgot to clean the bathroom, is that right?"" Empathize. Try to be understanding and put yourself in the other person's shoes.  , When we make mistakes we sometimes hurt others. Saying you are sorry shows that you regret the mistake, feel bad about the harm you’ve done, and that you want to do better in the future.Don’t give excuses or try to explain it away. Simply own up to it. Say, ""I admit I forgot to clean the bathroom. I am so sorry about that."" Be careful not to blame others. Do not say something like, ""If you would have reminded me to clean it then maybe I would have remembered and done it.""  , Expressing ways to make up for the problem and committing to working on the issues are effective ways to fix a mistake when it involves another person.   Try to work out a solution. Ask the person what they would like you to do to make up for it. You could say, ""Is there anything that I can do now?"" Figure out how to do things differently in the future. You can ask the person, ""What do you think might help me not make this mistake again?"" Tell the person that you are willing to put in the work to reduce the likelihood of making the mistake in the future. You could say something like, ""I do not want this to happen again so I will make an effort to ____."" Say exactly what you will do such as, ""I will make sure I write down a list of my chores so that I won't forget again.""

Real change has to be driven from your own desire to be better, feel better, and have a positive outlook on life. Change can be scary, but it you love and trust yourself you can get through changes unscathed.   Think of prior big changes in your life. Are they really scary in hindsight? How well did you handle the changes? What can you learn from them?; , A positive outlook on life and the future is paramount to enacting change. You need to first change how you look at yourself before you can change. Think of it this way – if you want to change your love life to become more open, you’re not going to get very far if you believe “I don’t deserve to be in love.” Erase this negative language from your mind by practicing positive refrains every day, like: “I love myself,” “I can do this,” “I am capable of changing.”Don’t punish yourself or get upset if you have a negative thought. Instead, replace it with an opposing, positive one. If you thought – “Women never like me,” counter it with “I haven’t met a woman who I am compatible with yet.”  , Even if your goals aren’t related to your body, being healthy and happy will make it much easier to focus on changing yourself for the better. Make sure that you are eating a balanced diet, getting 6-7 hours of sleep a night, and doing things you love to erase stress., Don’t judge yourself or get upset at your faults. This is the time to look at your behaviors through a neutral lens, figuring out exactly what about yourself you want to change. There is a reason you want to change, and you need to do some exploring to find it. Having clear motivations will make it much easier to change. Some questions to ask include:   Does this make me happy? What are the facts, not the feelings, about this situation? Why do I want to change? What is my end goal?  , This needs to be specific and goal-oriented. By setting smaller, more manageable goals you “trick” your brain into thinking the task is easier, making it easier to commit to your project. For example, you might want to reform your love life and become less shy. Setting small goals makes the larger idea, “change your love life,” seem less daunting.   Step 1: Think about what you want in a partner. What attracts you? What doesn’t? Make a list. Step 2: Think about what caused relationships to fail in the past. Start going to the gym, clean up your house, or focus more on work to improve your chances at love. Step 3: Commit to going out to bars and social events at least once a week, or make an online dating profile. Step 4: Ask one person out for a casual date. No matter what the answer, brush it off and keep trying.  , If you are trying to cut out junk food, it will be incredibly hard to quit eating pizza, soda, cake, candy, and fast-food all at once. Cut things out periodically, which lets you enjoy your early accomplishments and slowly get used to big changes. For example, you might start by eliminating soda from your diet. A week or two later, cut out pizza, then candy, and so on.   It can help to make a schedule, as this will keep you in check. If you write down that you are quitting pizza on April 20th, you are much more likely to actually quit than if you just say, “I’ll quit eventually.”  , What is the minimum you need to do, each day, to make your change stick? This is separate from the long-term goals or plans because it puts you in a mindset every day to work towards your change. If you want to reform your love life, you might decide to have one extra conversation with a stranger each day, whether on the bus or at work. This allows you to practice your larger goal without stress or fear.Your quota can be low—all it does is set the bar for you. You might decide to do 10 push-ups each day, but nothing keeps you from doing 100 some days as well.  , This goes against conventional wisdom, which often says that telling someone your goals makes you more likely to pursue them. However, study after study has found that people feel less motivated to work after announcing their plans because they feel slight satisfaction at making them.The exception to this rule is when working with a group, as working on a goal together frequently makes everyone work harder.   Writing down your goals and motivation and keeping them to yourself is a great way to be “public” about your plans to change without sharing anything., Change is often about stripping away the things that are no longer relevant to your life. This allows you to focus on what really matters, putting your energy into things that make you happier and healthy. Take a long look at your life and think about what is non-essential. What activities do you do that make you constantly unhappy? What projects or appointments do you put off for as long as possible? Is there any way to remove these stresses from your life?Think about little things first – cleaning out your email inbox, canceling you’re the newspaper subscription you never read, opening up your schedule, etc. You goal is to make more time in your life to focus on yourself, using your new free time to change for the better.  , Change takes time, and if it didn’t then everyone would be in constant flux. You need to commit to your change for months to make sure it sticks. Know that you will falter, slide back into your own ways, and consider changing your mind. This is only natural, but quitting your reformation at the first sign of trouble will prevent you from ever really changing.   In order for your brain to develop strong new neural connections that last throughout your life, you need to work on your change for up to 4-5 months.Keep you goal in mind when things get tough. The amount of time needed to get there is not what is important, the destination is.

"['learn the two different types of beans', 'consider growing a pole-bean variety', 'consider growing a bush-bean variety', 'choose your garden plot', 'know when to plant', 'know how to plant', 'prepare your soil', 'set up your trellis', 'dig a hole', 'place the seeds', 'water your seeds regularly', 'put down a layer of mulch after the seeds sprout', 'fertilize your garden every four weeks', 'pick bean pods before the shapes of the beans show through', 'dry your beans on the plant', 'freeze beans for later use']",How to Grow a Bean Plant," In general, there are two overall types of beans: shell beans and snap beans. Both types can grow in either the pole- or bush-style, but the pods of the beans are what make them unique. Shell beans are primarily removed from their pod to be eaten, and are consumed fresh or dried to save for later. Snap beans are eaten inside their pod, and are only eaten fresh (not dried for later use). You can grow multiple styles of these beans directly adjacent to one another, because bean plants are self-pollinating and won’t cross-contaminate each other.   Popular shell beans include black beans, fava beans, black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, and kidney beans. Popular snap beans include snap (green) beans, adzuki beans, mung beans, asparagus beans, and scarlet-runner beans.; , Pole beans are a type of beans that are vining and must be supported with a trellis or pole. Pole beans grow an average of 5- to 6-feet tall, and can grow either shell or snap bean. Pole beans generally thrive in cooler summer temperatures, as low as 50-degrees in the summer. In the US, they thrive in the northern states.   You can use whatever support system (trellis, pole, fence, arbor, etc.) that you want for pole beans.  , Bush beans are a type of beans that grow in off a bush, and do not need a trellis or pole for support. Generally, bush beans grow best in warm environments with summer temperatures reaching above 100-degrees. In the US, they thrive in the Southern states. Bush beans should be planted in large rows, requiring much more space than pole beans.   A variety of bush beans called ‘half-runners’ is a bush/pole hybrid, and may require some support or placement near a fence for stabilization., Beans are flexible plants, able to grow in both sun and shade. When possible, choose a garden plot in most or partial sunlight. Because pole beans grow primarily upwards, you need only a small space for them. Bush beans grow outwards, meaning that they require much more space; choose a plot 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) wide and as long as you desire (for the total number of beans you wish to plant).  , Beans should be planted after the last frost has passed, typically in the spring months of March and April. Planting too early in the season will cause the seeds to freeze and die, while planting too late may not give them enough time to mature for a harvest in the fall. Check with your local agricultural extension to find out the best planting time for your area.  , Beans are one of the few plants that should not be started as seedlings indoors or transplanted into your garden. This is because they have a delicate root structure that is easily damaged, and may not survive the transfer. As a result, you should sow your seeds directly into the ground come spring., Beans grow best in soil with good drainage and lots of nutrients. To prepare your soil, mix in a garden compost and gardening topsoil into your garden plot. Use a hoe to till the soil thoroughly and break apart any clay-like chunks. Incorporating the compost into the soil will help to provide plenty of nutrients to help the beans grow.   Beans are nitrogen fixing, meaning they can pull nitrogen from the air and add fertility to the soil. They do this in symbiosis with bacteria. If you have not previously grown beans on your plot, consider adding a bacterial inoculant. You can dust your seeds with it, or add some to each hole when planting., If you’re planting pole beans, you will need to put your trellis in the ground prior to planting the beans. Place the trellis, stake, or pole in the exact area you plan to plant. As the beans grow, they will naturally wind themselves around the structure for support. Dig a hole deep enough to stabilize the trellis/pole, should there be bad weather or heavy winds., Pole beans should be planted so that there is one seed per hole, and each seed is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the next. Bush beans should be planted so that there is one seed per hole, and each seed is at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the next. The hole should be 1-inch deep.Remember that bush beans need more space in between plants than pole bean as pole beans grow vertically.  , Carefully put one seed in each hole you’ve dug; it may be tempting to put multiple seeds at once, but this will cause the seedlings to compete for space and nutrients as they grow, and possibly result in the death of the plant. Cover up each seed with 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of your garden soil.  , Immediately after planting, give your seeds plenty of water to aid in their germination. After planting, you should continue to water the seeds once every 2-3 days, so that the soil is always moist. Avoid over watering though, as too much water (leaving puddles or pools on the topsoil) will cause the seeds to rot.  , Mulch is an incredibly helpful tool for new gardeners. Made from trees, leaves, or straw, mulch is a layer of shredded plant limbs you place over the topsoil in your garden. This blocks out weeds and traps in moisture, two good things for new plants. Spread a layer of mulch 1-inch thick over your garden soil after your seeds have grown several inches tall.  , Fertilizer adds nutrients to garden soil, helping increase the growth of your beans and the overall harvest. Fertilizers are made of a combination of three primary ingredients: nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Beans naturally produce a lot of nitrogen, meaning that you should look for a fertilizer that has low nitrogen content (such as a 5-20-20 mixture). Ask your local nursery worker with help on choosing a fertilizer for your beans, if you have questions.Do not add nitrogen fertilizer to the soil if you added a nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The bacteria will help the plants make their own.  , If you want to eat your beans fresh, you should pick your beans when the pods are large and full. The pods should not yet show the shape of the beans, because by that stage they have begun to dry out. Harvest the pods by snapping them off at the top; don’t tear them, as this can damage the plant and prevent new pods from sprouting.   If you harvest at the right time, your bean plants could continue to produce new pods for several weeks.  , If you want to dry your shell beans for later use, the process is easy: leave your beans on the plant until they are completely dry. This process usually takes 1-2 months after having reached peak ripeness. You can tell when the beans are totally dry and ready for storage, as they will rattle inside the pods., Fresh beans can be frozen and used later, if you don’t want them fresh but don’t want to dry them. Simply place them in an airtight container and put them in your freezer. They will remain good for 6-9 months after initially being placed in the freezer; thaw them by letting them rise to room temperature.

"['start the conversation', 'help them find out their interests', 'make them realize you have grown up', 'spend time with them doing things they like', 'be consistently supportive']",How to Convince Parents to Find Time for Themselves," The very first and basic step is you need to initiate talking about the matter. Keep it light. You have to bring that comfort level so that they feel like they can open up to you. This comes through sharing and asking them about what is happening in their life. Slowly you need to encourage them to include some activity. By regularly asking them about how and what they're doing, you can encourage them to find activities that keep themselves busy, which will keep them active as well as mentally or physically fit and more over they’ll start enjoying their life and leisure time.; , You might already have a head start here. Your mum might have told you how she likes to try new recipes or she wishes she knew how to take better photographs, or your dad may enjoy hanging out with his friends or playing chess. Help them find what they want to do. Ask them about where their interests lie and if necessary, make suggestions. Encourage your mom to join a book group or a cooking class. Ask if your dad wants to join a club or start writing articles or a novel. By encouraging them in whatever endeavors interest them, you can help release them from the idea that their whole life revolves around you.  , Parents are sometimes scared of finding time for themselves or doing anything for themselves because they think it might distract them from being parents. You need to assure them that now you are grown enough to look after yourself, it’s time for them to focus on themselves. You need to convince them that you are grown up! This won’t happen by simply saying to them, “Ma/Papa, I am grown up now. I can look after myself.” No! Truly convincing them requires you to handle your responsibilities and demonstrate your independence through your actions.   Not only can you show responsibility for yourself, but you can also show them that you're ready and eager to help them out, too. Taking your parents to their appointments, helping them around the house, or doing other favors and errands for them can help. Taking care of their needs and most importantly finding time for them is key, too; call them regularly to ask how their day was or what are they planning to do this weekend will make a big difference. Bottom line is you have to make them realize you can take care of yourself, so now they should spend their time on themselves.  , If they like doing something, get involved in it with them. If your dad likes playing pool, go and play with him. If your mum likes playing games on her phone, sit along with her and watch her play. If she likes cooking, ask her to teach you a new recipe, or suggest a new recipe to her. By showing your enthusiasm for what they're doing, you can subtly push them to stay engaged with those activities. And the fact that you are taking interest in what they are doing will keep them motivated; everyone likes to feel appreciated and supported for the things they want to do.  , No plan will succeed unless it’s been put to practice consistently. On a regular basis, talk about their interests and activities and motivate them to keep on finding time for themselves. Regularly suggest new ideas they can try if they lose interest in the hobbies they've been pursuing so far.  ","['things', 'time', 'conversation', 'interests']"

Feeling down can cause you to want to withdraw. That's normal. But you will feel better if you attempt some human contact.Pick up the phone. Reach out to a friend and ask if they have a few minutes to talk. You can try keeping the tone light, but making your feelings clear. Say, ""I'm feeling a little lonely and I could use a laugh. What's the funniest thing that happened to you today?"" The phone is a great way to keep in touch. Maybe you have moved away from some of your friends and are looking for a way to connect. Don't be afraid to dial their numbers regularly.; , Traveling is a great way to beat the loneliness blues. Figure out somewhere to go and start planning. Organizing a trip will give you something fun to focus on and look forward to.Go visit a friend. Have you been longing for a girls weekend with your best friends? Find a great spot to meet and start planning. You can also plan a solo trip. Choose a place to visit that you've always wanted to see. You could also mix some alone time with some socializing. Have you been missing your brother lately? Take a road trip. You can take a few days to yourself on your way to visit him.  , Start putting some dates on the calendar. Reach out to some friends and set up some outings. When you're feeling lonely, it can be really helpful to have something fun to look forward to.Plan a variety of activities. For example, e-mail a friend you haven't seen in a while and ask if she's free for a coffee date. You could also schedule some evening activities. Ask your neighbor if he wants to try out the new pizza place around the corner. Consider having a party. You don't need a special occasion to reach out to your friends and ask them to come over for a wine and cheese party.  , When you are feeling especially lonely, it might not be enough to just have a casual get together with a friend. Sometimes you might feel like you need some more in-depth bonding. Try reaching out to someone you really care for and asking for some quality time.Contact a family member. Try saying, ""I've been feeling a little down lately. It would be great to spend some time with you. Do you mind if I come spend the weekend with you?"" Be honest about how you're feeling. Remember, it's normal to feel lonely. Let your friends and family help. Do something you enjoy. Ask a close friend to go on a long hike with you. The fresh air and companionship might make you feel better.  , You don't have to reach out to someone you know. You can actually feel less alone by connecting with a perfect stranger. Try doing something nice for someone.Give up your seat on a crowded bus. Smile and say, ""Here, you take this seat."" You'll feel like you are helping someone, which will make you feel better.

"['watch the keeper', 'check the wind', 'follow through', 'run up to the ball', 'keep your standing foot close to the ball', 'kick the ball straight', ""curl the ball if you don't have a straight shot"", 'use a knuckle ball to make a unique shot', 'stall the wall', 'catch the keeper off guard', 'find weak links in the wall', 'switch your feet']",How to Score a Direct Free Kick," The opposing keeper will give you a good idea about where to aim your kick. When a direct free kick is called, some of the opposing players will form a wall ten yards away from you in front of the keeper. While the purpose of the wall is to help the keeper defend against the kick, it can also obscure his view of the striker. Usually, the keeper will try to stay in the middle of the goal. If he does this, aim your kick toward either the left or right goal post.   If the keeper remains closer to one side of the goal, aim your shot to the opposite side or try to kick it over the wall. Try to put the ball in a difficult spot for the keeper to react to. You might even be able to trick the keeper by looking in the opposite direction and kicking where he started off. If the infraction occurs in the opposing penalty box, you’ll kick a penalty kick. This is a type of direct free kick in which only the striker and the goalie participate.; , You should always know how hard and which direction the wind is blowing before you take your kick. Severe wind can drastically alter the trajectory of the ball. Take a peek at the corner flags on either side of the pitch before you set up your shot. Take the wind into consideration and adjust your aim so that the ball still goes where you want it to.   Remember that a strong gust of wind can also cause your ball to sail over the goal post so you might have to aim the ball lower than you normally would. A weak kick will be affected by the wind more than a powerful kick.  , Complete the motion of your kick by bringing your leg all the way through. Following through with your shot will guide it in the right direction. Think of your leg like a pendulum swinging straight through the ball. If you don’t follow through with your shot, it may end up in a different spot than you intend it to.          Keep your follow through controlled. If you try to follow through too much, you could hyper-extend your leg or slip and fall on your back. Your kick should always be controlled so you don't get hurt. Hold your follow through for a few seconds after kicking the ball.  , The length of your run-up will depend on how much power you need to generate for your shot. If the direct kick is placed far away from the opposing goal, you’ll need more power. Measure out four or five steps. Your run-up for a long shot should cover about ten yards. If the direct kick is placed closer to the opposing goal, accuracy will be more important than power. For a short shot, you may only need to take a one step run-up.         Practice your run-up before game time to get it perfect. If you stutter-step to the ball, you’ll lose power and accuracy. When deciding how long of a run-up to take, take into account the strength of your leg. If you’re a particularly powerful striker, you might not need to take as long of a run-up.  , When you kick the ball, make sure that your non-kicking foot lands as close as possible to the ball. The nearer to the ball your standing foot is when you make contact, the better control you’ll have over where the ball goes. If your standing leg is far away from the ball, you might unintentionally slice or hook your shot.Make sure that your standing leg does not touch the ball. If it does, you’ll be called for a double touch when you kick it. When your foot lands, make sure it is pointed toward where you want the shot to go.  , If you want your kick to travel in a straight line, aim just below the center of the ball. The top of your foot should make contact with the ball in the center of your laces. If you do this properly, the ball will move directly where you kick it. Contacting the ball in the middle of your laces will also give your kick more power.   You may want to use this style for longer direct free kicks or if you see an opening in your opponent’s defense that you want to quickly exploit. This type of kick is not good for kicking over the wall. Your ball will continue moving in a straight line after it crosses the wall and will likely sail over the net.  , If you can’t find a straight path to the goal, you can try curling or bending your shot around the defenders. To curl the ball, you’ll need to get it spinning. Contact the ball with the inside of your foot. Try to kick the ball slightly to the right of its center to make it start spinning. After you make contact with the ball, follow through towards your opposite leg instead of straight in front of you.         Curling the ball can help you get it around the wall. If you are kicking from far away, you can still curl the ball with the top of your foot. However, the ball won’t curve as much as if you use the inside of your foot.  , A knuckle ball is a kick that has very little to no spin. Because the ball isn’t spinning in a particular direction, it can move in a very unpredictable way. To kick a knuckle ball, kick it with the densest part of your foot. Make contact with the ball at the top inside corner of your laces near your sock. After you make contact with the ball bring your kicking leg toward your non-kicking leg. Don’t follow through when kicking a knuckle ball or you'll cause it to spin.Rather than swinging through, think of kicking the ball in a punching motion. A knuckle ball can move straight down, in a loop or side-to-side depending on how little it spins.  , When you kick a direct free kick, your opponents have to be at least ten yards away from you. When the referee gives you the okay to kick, the players in the opposing wall will start to inch towards you to get in position to block your shot. Have two of your teammates stand on either side of the wall to keep it from advancing.The opposing team will think twice about over-committing to your shot if there’s two people on either side of them that could get the ball.  , The opposing keeper might expect you to take your time to plan out your direct kick. If you immediately take the shot right when the referee blows the whistle, the goalie might not be prepared to react to it. This tactic works best for shorter direct free kicks and penalty kicks. If you have to kick from far away, the keeper will have more time to react.   A straight kick works best for this move as you want the ball to reach the net as quickly as possible.You can also watch footage of the opposing keeper in previous games. See what kind of shots they have difficulty defending.  , If you have to shoot the ball over the wall during a direct free kick, you should try to find the easiest route to the goal. Identify the shortest player on the opposing wall and try to kick the ball over their head. Remember that the ball has to go over the wall, but come down far enough to travel under the top of the goal post.          Taller players will force you to kick too high and the ball may not come down in time to reach the net.  , If you have the ability to kick the ball confidently with both legs, you should change your kicking foot depending on what side of the goal you're on. If you’re kicking from the right side of the goal, you’ll have an easier time scoring using your left foot. If you’re kicking from the left side of the goal, you’ll be able to take a more effective shot using your right foot.Sometimes coaches will use separate strikers to kick direct free kicks from different parts of the pitch. If one of your legs is dominant, always use it to shoot free kicks. The angle from which you attack the goal isn’t as important as the accuracy of your kick.

When you are preparing for PCAT, you should have that self-confidence of achieving what you want to do in life. Learn your strengths and qualities as you prepare for the test. Suppose you are studying PCAT Chemistry and you come across certain problems, you should not feel bad about it. Instead,  make sure that you ask an expert and get your doubts cleared. At the end of the day, you should aim to understand all that you study, so that you do not face any problems while answering a question.; , Life will try to put several obstacles on your way, but you have to be strong enough to handle all that you face. If you are able to change the way you think, you can change a lot of things that come in your way.   You should have a positive attitude to change all your negative thoughts into positive ones. Get rid of all your negative thoughts and deal with the entire situation accordingly. Think rationally and then find out a solution to your problems. Inculcate some realistic thoughts and ways to deal with difficult situations and then interpret events accordingly. Your confidence will increase definitely if you find out that you are able to change the way you think.  , They say practice makes perfect. When you are preparing for the  PCAT examination, you should know about the type of questions that you are going to face in the examination. Hence, make sure that you solve as many practice papers as you can.   The more you practice; you will be able to get acquainted with the test taking techniques and strategies of the examination. Moreover, these practice papers will give you an insight of the pattern of questions that you are going to face in the examination. On the other hand, solving the test papers will give you control over time. Try to solve practice test papers within the given time limit and, if possible, sit with a stopwatch. With regular practice, you will become confident enough to face the atrocities of time and overcome the challenges that such an examination throws on your way.  , Revision is necessary to know your chapters by heart. In simple words,  if you do not revise, you will not be able to remember all that you have studied.   Whenever you read something, after sometime, close your eyes and then try to reminisce what you have studied. Review and revision is essential to retain all that you have studied in your memory. Once you know that you are well prepared, then you will surely be confident about your capabilities and can get rid of exam pressure as well.  , Do not think about your previous failures. Remembering previous defeat will surely knock you down. Crush all your fears within and rise up. Tell yourself that though you cannot control the situations in your life, but you can surely control your decisions and your life. Remind yourself about all the good deeds that you have done in life. If you keep on reminding yourself about the mistakes in your life, then your confidence will be shattered to pieces. All you can do is learn from your mistakes and move on in life.  , You need to make yourself believe that you can handle and overcome crisis situations. The researchers are of the opinion that faking  confidence will actually lead you to have faith in yourself and generate confidence in you. A positive attitude is something that you need to overcome all the oddities in life. If you have really prepared well for your examination, then nothing can stop you from achieving what you want in life. Visualize success in front of you and put your best foot forward to achieve what you want from life. Motivate yourself to perform better each day and make sure that you do not procrastinate. Finishing a practice paper when you have time in hand will surely make you all the  more enthusiastic and confident. Be aware of your hidden talents and skills and make use of them. At the end of the day, you will see that you are able to handle any situation of your life. Your confidence will also increase by leaps and bounds and you will be ready to face your PCAT exam.

Your first few years of graduate school are crucial because they will introduce you to the important scholarship in your field. As you work to master this material, you might as well consider what you might be able to add to it. Keep a running list of your ideas. Ask yourself:   What areas of your field need further exploration? Is some of the existing scholarship lacking in nuance? Could you apply an existing scholarly model to new situations or difference evidence? What existing scholarly arguments might be effectively challenged, given appropriate evidence? Are there important scholarly debates in your field that you might be able to address, using a different focus?; , Even within the same field, different departments approach the dissertation project in a variety of ways. You need to know what a satisfactory dissertation looks like in your field, from your university, written with the support of your department – and ideally, your particular advisor and committee members. Doing some basic research will help you feel more confident and make the process seem a little less shrouded in mystery. You will be more likely to choose a project that will enable you to fulfill your department’s expectations.   Ask questions. Your advisor or Director of Graduate Studies should be able to give you some information about departmental standards for the dissertation and answer any general questions you have. Examine completed dissertations from your department. Many universities put doctoral dissertations online or shelve them at the library. Look at a few recent ones. How long are they, on average? What kind of research do they contain? How are they typically organized?  , Be open-minded and receptive to their suggestions.   Remember that people who have been through the dissertation process already may be in a better position than you are to recognize the potential problems with some of your ideas. If they advise you that a particular idea is overly ambitious or that you will be unlikely to find evidence to answer a certain research question, listen to them and take their input seriously.  , You want to choose a project that can be completed in a reasonable amount of time, given the resources you are likely to have.Unfortunately, this sometimes means that you’ll have to set aside some of your most exciting and ambitious ideas. Remember: if you cannot complete your dissertation within the time constraints, then it won’t matter how brilliant or revolutionary your ideas were.   Consider department and university timelines. Most programs limit the number of years you can spend on your dissertation. Know your time constraints, and factor them into the process of choosing a project. In many fields, you will have to factor in your funding possibilities. How much travel, archival research, and/or laboratory work will your project require? How will you fund that work? How much money, realistically, will you be able to pull together? The answers to these questions will help you determine how realistic a given idea might be.  , Once you’ve solicited advice, considered practical issues, and narrowed down your options, think about which potential projects fascinate you the most. The dissertation process is a long one. You will be living and breathing this project for a long time. Make it something that excites you.  , Once you’ve tentatively chosen a project, you need to read whatever scholarly material already exists on your topic (and even on subjects closely related to your topic). Do exhaustive searches in whatever databases your field typically uses. There is nothing worse than realizing, halfway through your dissertation research, that someone else has already published something that answers your question, or that someone else has already attempted to do so and determined that the evidence does not exist.  , Once you’ve chosen a project and done the necessary background reading, it can be hard to figure out where to start.You haven’t yet undertaken the research necessary to formulate a solid argument, so, for the time being, think of your project as a scholarly question you want to answer. Later, when you think you have the answer, it can become your thesis – the original argument that your dissertation will make.   In general, “how” and “why” questions work best for dissertations, as they will yield richer, more complex answers.  , Once you know where you’ll need to go and what kind of work you’ll need to do, start applying for all available funding – from your department, from your university, and from external organizations.Academic funding moves slowly: you might, for example, apply for a grant in October, receive notice that you’ve won the award (or not) in March, and get to use the money at some point beginning in June. If you don’t cast a wide net and get an early start, you could add years to your dissertation timeline.  , Your advisor will be the person who guides your research, supports you emotionally and mentally through the development of your project, and ultimately signs off on your work. You should select someone whose work you respect, who is relatively easy to get along with, and who communicates effectively.   You should try to find an advisor who is happy to offer guidance but still allows your work to be your work.Someone who is overly rigid may not be easy to work with during revisions or if your work goes in a new direction.  , In general, you want people with whom you’ve already worked closely and whose specific fields of expertise vary. Different perspectives are valuable.Be aware that, depending on your institution, you may not be able to select your committee members. It is common to form your own committee in the US, but in other parts of the world, the dissertation advisor often puts together a committee for the student.  , It’s important to come up with a system that works for you early in the dissertation process – this way, you’ll stay organized and able to keep track of what will quickly become a huge amount of material. Your advisor, committee members, and fellow graduate students are good sources of advice about which kinds of systems work best for your kind of project.   Electronic note-taking systems like Zotero, EndNote, and OneNote are life-savers for many graduate students. They will allow you to keep bibliographic references and research notes organized and coded, and they make searching for specific information much easier. Unless you very strongly prefer paper and pencil, one of these programs will be beneficial. Experiment to see which you like best.  , Using the proper formatting for writing, references, works cited, and footnotes from the start of your project will make your final stages much easier; do not wait until the end and go back to re-format everything.   The appropriate style will vary from field to field; the most common styles are APA, MLA, Chicago, and Turabian. In addition to the “parent style” of your discipline, your institution may have specific formatting guidelines for your dissertation (such as end notes instead of footnotes). Some even provide templates to use while composing the dissertation. Check with your advisor or the Director of Graduate Studies before you begin writing to find out information about formatting.  , Perhaps your preliminary laboratory test results don’t show what you think they will, or the archive you visit doesn’t have the evidence you think it has. Maybe, after extensive research, you realize that you’re asking an unanswerable question. This is not necessarily a crisis. Most graduate students have to adjust their dissertation plans in some way.   It is quite common from the final dissertation to differ significantly from the prospectus/proposal. As you research, the direction of your work may necessarily shift or change.  , Make sure that you contact your advisor and other committee members with updates on your work and any questions that arise.This will prevent unpleasant surprises down the road – if, for example, a committee member does not like a new direction that your project is taking, it’s better to know that early than to find out when you submit your manuscript.  , Try to think about one chapter (and even one sub-division of one chapter) at a time.  , Even before your research is complete, you can start outlining and writing small parts of your dissertation. Do it! A year in the future, when all you’re doing, it seems, is writing, you will be very, very glad that you did.   Don’t assume that you need to start with your first planned chapter and move straight through the projected manuscript. If your first solid research yields something that speaks to your third chapter, start there! Move back and forth between chapters if that’s what works best.  , Be flexible and realistic when necessary, but try to meet major deadlines. Many people find a reverse calendar quite helpful for dissertation writing.  , Write for an hour or two as soon as you get up. Are you a night owl? Promise yourself you’ll spend two hours writing during that window. Whatever your most productive time of day is, use it for your most difficult work.  , Having a space that is limited to productive work can help you focus and be in “work mode.”  , Don’t wait until you have a completed draft to solicit feedback. At the very least, send chapter drafts to your advisor as you finish them. Even better, share chapters-in-progress with other grad students or trusted mentors in your field.   Many departments offer writing workshops for graduate students. If yours does, take advantage of it! This is a great way to get feedback on your work during its earlier stages.  , Ideally, you’ll want to aim to take one day a week completely off from your dissertation work. You’ll have time to recharge, and you’ll return to your work with more energy and a fresh perspective. So get together with friends or family, go to the movies, take a yoga class, bake something delicious – whatever makes you feel rested and happy.   Consider building larger breaks into the process. If you wait until your dissertation is complete to celebrate your work and take a break, you’ll have a long, grim road ahead of you. Take a three-day weekend when you finish a chapter draft! Celebrate the end of a long, difficult research trip with a week of relaxation! This time off might feel lazy or frivolous, but it’s not – it’s necessary for your well-being.  , Doctoral candidates are notoriously unhealthy. They suffer from anxiety, stress, and depression; they eat poorly, skip exercising, and don’t get enough sleep. But you will be stronger and more productive if you take care of yourself, so don’t fall into this trap!   Eat well. Get enough protein, fiber, and vitamins, and drink plenty of water. Avoid sugary junk, fried foods, and excessive amounts of alcohol – all of these things will make you feel worse. Maintain an exercise routine. You may think you don’t have time, but if you make it a priority, you can carve out thirty minutes a day for some kind of exercise – running, biking, even just walking. Get enough sleep.Don’t be a martyr to the dissertation cause: you can get it done without staying up all night. Get your eight hours, and you’ll feel much better.  , While you are still working on your dissertation is the time to become active in your field. Talk to your advisor about the potential of publishing parts of your research prior to finishing the dissertation. Attend and present at conferences. Deliver presentations or poster sessions about your research. Discuss your work with other people in the field and ask for advice.Dress and act like a professional, not like an undergraduate student, while you are at conferences. The prospect of becoming a professional academic can help you stay motivated in the final stages of your dissertation work.  , Once the end of your dissertation is in sight, you’ll need to know what your department and your university require in order to award you the degree. Do you need to schedule a defense of your dissertation? Who needs to approve your work? What paperwork will you need to turn in? Once you know the answers to these questions, you’ll be able to plan the final stages of your doctoral program.  , Meet with each committee member. Let him or her know that you are approaching completion, and ask what they’d like from you. How far in advance of the defense do they need to see a manuscript? Do they foresee any problems passing you?   This process will be much easier if, as suggested above, you kept in contact with your committee members throughout the dissertation process. Ideally, this will be a formality: there shouldn’t be any surprises.  , If you will have to defend your dissertation to your committee members, practice explaining your argument succinctly and, especially, describing the value of your work. This will come in handy at your defense, but it will also serve you well afterward, at conferences or in job interviews.   Practice answering, especially, the “so what?” question.Imagine a committee member says to you, “So, you’ve demonstrated that . So what?” How would you answer? Know why your work matters in your field.  , Dissertations are long, and you’ll likely be exhausted by the time you get to the home stretch. Have several people read your draft before you hand it to your committee members. This will eliminate unnecessary mistakes and identify unclear passages that need work.  , As you complete your writing, you may start to worry about what your committee will think of your work. Keep in mind that no one knows your material as well as you do. Have faith in yourself. You are now the one and only expert on this small aspect of your field.  , As you finish your dissertation, you may feel especially anxious – worried about your defense, concerned about your work’s value, stressed out about finishing graduate school and moving on to a new phase of your life. These feelings are normal, but don’t let them get out of control. Talk to a trusted friend, and practice the healthy habits described above.  , Whether you have a formal defense or not, completing your dissertation is a massive, once-in-a-lifetime accomplishment. Enjoy it. Be proud of yourself. Share the moment with friends and family. Celebrate a job well done – you are now a Dr.!

Don't only write homework, but make sure to write down other stuff you'll need to remember (like games, practices, study sessions, etc). In order to be a successful high school student, you need to have the ability to stay on top of all your activities. Use your agenda to stay organized and follow through with your plans. Also, use your agenda to set time limits. If you're spending more than an hour on that math assignment, you're clearly not getting it, and are only hurting yourself. Stop, put it aside, move on to other homework. Come back to it later and if you still don't get it, explain what happened to your teacher. Chances are, they'll be happy to help and not dock your grade. Just make sure you've made an attempt to do the work.; , Make sure you have all the supplies you need. It may help to have one 3-ring binder with pockets for each class (maybe only a folder for an elective class) with loose-leaf paper and dividers if they help. If your teacher likes to lecture, have a spiral or composition notebook for notes and jot down pictures and thoughts to help you remember- the pages are less likely to rip out than loose-leaf. Keep papers in chronological order- they'll be easier to find later when studying. If your binder starts to get full, transfer old papers into another binder to keep at home. This way you won't have to lug them around, but they will be there when studying for midterms and finals.  , You don't have to be the nerd who holes himself/herself up in his/her bedroom Friday night or reads gigantic books in the corner of the room to be considered someone who takes school seriously. The truth is, school is important. You need it to have a good resume, and you need it to get into a good college and later get a good career that will support you for the rest of your life, but even though you decide not to go to college, school does help a lot. Social wise and intellectually. It's important to have fun and have lots of extra-curricular activities, but school should always be your number one priority. That being said, never take homework, tests, and quizzes lightly! Note that extra-curricular activities are also good with college resumes as well.  , Balance is the key. You can be someone who makes straight A's in all advanced classes, but if you have zero extra-curricular activities in your application for college, you will have a much more difficult time getting accepted. It's just not attractive either way. Keep on top of your schoolwork but make sure you let your hair down a little sometimes to join a few clubs consistently throughout your high school years. You won't regret it.  , You don't have to wear spirit colors everyday or be a cheerleader to do this. All you need to do is to stay on top of things- current events, who won the basketball game last Friday, attending school functions like dances and variety shows, keeping up with plans your student council has for the school, etc. Just like keeping up with current events and politics is important, so is being active at your campus. Not only will it bond you with other people, but it's always good to have a collective unity over a student body. It shows that you care about the learning environment that you're in that you support all the organizations at your school.  , It's easy to forget to stay in shape when the workload starts piling up, so joining a team at your school makes it one less worry in your schedule; it's already incorporated in your daily routine. If you're going for all three seasons, that's great, but make sure you're being reasonable. If you're taking all honors classes, for example, and you know you're going to have a heck of a lot of homework, you may want to consider taking a season off. Try your hardest at both your sport and your schoolwork and you should be more than great- you're healthy and on top of your schoolwork.  , Not being an athlete is no excuse for not having something to do after school. If you're into art, join the art club. Music, and join the orchestra or a band. Join something and be sure to stick with it for a long time; it looks good on college applications. If you're not into any of your school's clubs, ask your principal to start a new one. Most likely he/she will say yes and it's just one quick and easy process into a initiating a new activity at your school.  , As soon as sophomore year, start visiting universities. You don't need to decide anything yet, but it will help you decide if you want a large school or small (urban, rural, or suburban, if a state school is an acceptable choice, and so on). Visit your guidance counselor a lot- they're going to have to write a letter of recommendation so the better they know you, the better a letter you'll get. They'll also be able to help recommend universities and find scholarships.  , Your GPA is as important to you as your parents credit score is to them. A low credit score prevents your parent from being able to get a loan, rent an apartment, get a credit card, get a cell phone and on and on. Your parents credit score is their lifeline. It opens doors and closes doors. Your GPA is your lifeline! With a high GPA many options are available after graduation. You will have many choices regarding which colleges you can attend. A low GPA limits your options. There is a program out there for everyone but having a choice makes the walk across the stage a sweet victory!  , There's too much going on to worry about cliques, who's friends with whom, who the popular people are, etc. The best thing to do is to just be friends with everyone. Be confident and be yourself. Get into the habit of saying hi to people and not being afraid to talk to new classmates. The more comfortable you become with a more diverse group of people, the more people will like you and the more you will accustom yourself to the art of versatility later in life.  , It cannot be stressed enough that there's already too much on your plate to worry about trivial stuff like this. High school is only a competition with yourself. Everyday you should only be trying to get better, not worrying about how the girl sitting in front of you has nicer clothes, is getting better grades, has a hotter boyfriend, etc. Ten years from now, this won't matter. Focus on yourself. Focus on what you can do to make yourself better. Then, most importantly, go for it!  , This is probably the #1 curse of all high school students. It's hard and it's okay if you do it every once in a while. But when big tests, exams, and essays come, don't make it a habit. You'll only be sorry in the end, especially in college with jumbo papers and insane amounts of reading will become the norm. It's best to accustom yourself to getting things done early and out of the way rather than waiting until the very last minute.Make a plan and a list of homework. Keep it somewhere you can see it and won't forget it. Don't forget due dates!  , It sounds stupid, but you'd be surprised how many people skip breakfast or lunch. Not only is this dumb, but it's uncool and unhealthy. First of all, waffles are yummy. If you don't have time to eat breakfast at home, take some to the bus stop or buy some at your cafeteria before the first period. It's important to jumpstart your metabolism the right way so it's running smoothly throughout the whole day. Lunch is important to prevent your stomach from grumbling during your last periods. A full stomach keeps you focused. Skipping meals actually only slows down your metabolism and makes you gain more weight, not less.  , Don't fall for the vending machine trap. Most of the food in there is just unhealthy and disgusting. Go for the soy chips or anything whole grain if the vending machine is all you have the moment. Don't fall for the Vitamin Water trap either- it's loaded with sugar. Only if you're a competitive athlete and will be burning off those 400+ calories pretty soon should you pay for that jumbo pack of gummy bears or something.   At home, take an after-school snack to keep your belly full until dinner time--invest in fruits, nuts, and healthy chips. Loading on junk food during the day is not only unhealthy but will only give you a temporary ""energy"" for homework or that 10-page paper you have to write tonight.  , This is easier said than done, but sleep has so many benefits. If every high school kid got around 8-9 hours like they should, everyone would be a much happier camper. Try to get things done and out of the way so that you get your much needed shuteye. Not only will you be more alert during the day, but it helps improve your complexion and your figure, and you'll be much more likely to pay attention in your boring classes and, as a result, ace them. Of course, this is not always possible, especially in the dreaded junior year. If you're taking 3+ AP's and are in all those clubs and sports, there are chances you will be up until 1 AM doing homework - if that happens, skip clubs/sports the next day and nap! You are no good to anyone when you are severely sleep deprived. Naps are wonderful things. Also, caffeine can help you keep focused - but there are potential side effects, and addiction can hurt you in the short and long term . Try to use the stimulant in moderate amounts and only when absolutely necessary e.g. an important test.  , This doesn't mean you should then go to school the next day wearing pantyhose on your head, or whatever. You should have your own style and your own identity, so that you make your mark in high school the right way and not as a nondescript UGG-wearing replica of every other girl (or guy) out there. Be original, and don't be afraid to be yourself. It's a cliché, but it's essential. People are more likely to remember you and want to be friends with you if you are intriguing and different.  , You endured 5 agonizing days of school, and the time has come to cut yourself some slack. During the weekend, if you have friends to go with, go somewhere fun and have a blast. Even if you don't have many friends, spend the weekend relaxing and doing what you like to do. Let yourself loose and energize yourself so when Monday comes, you're all partied out and ready to focus again. But remember that school is the top priority, so don't do this if you have a ton of homework this weekend.  , Again, cliché, but important. High school is all about making a fool of yourself but picking yourself back up, trying again, and making friends along the way. Learn to laugh at yourself when you make a mistake. Don't beat yourself up over the occasional C or D (heaven forbid an F) on a test or quiz. Tell yourself to study harder and strive for an A the next time. If your team lost a game, tell yourself to push yourself a little harder at the next practice. Learning this will soon apply outside of school and into other parts of your fantastic life.

"['get the right supplies', 'find the best pokémon', ""choose your ev spread if you haven't already"", 'know what pokémon to defeat to gain evs', 'right?']",How to EV Train a Pokémon in X & Y1," Before you begin training, you need some items if you want to train as fast as possible in as little time as you can. First, you want to get 10 vitamins for all stats (or just the stats you need, if you've already picked your spread).   You can get these in Laverre City's Pokémon Center. They're a bit pricey, but use some Bargain O-Powers and you should be able to afford them. Next, you need the Power items. You can get these in the Battle Maison in Kiloude City for BP. You need 16 BP for each though, so prepare to do a LOT of battling to get these. Optionally, you can only battle enough to get the items you need for a specific Pokémon. These items are not required, but are greatly recommended as they will increase the number of EVs given per Pokémon. These are: Power Bracer (For Attack) Power Anklet (for Speed) Power Weight (for HP) Power Lens (for Special Attack) Power Belt (for Defense) Power Band (for Special Defense); , After getting the items you need, you'll want a level 50-100 Pokémon that has a move that can attack multiple Pokémon like Earthquake. You'll also need a Pokémon with the disease Pokerus, which can be received over Wonder Trade or in the wild. It's not absolutely necessary, but like the Power items, they make the process go much faster.   Once you've acquired these, put the carrier of Pokerus in front of your party and turn off the Exp. Share in your Key Items. Battle a few Pokémon until the Pokémon you want to train has the disease, and you can put the carrier away in the PC and turn the Exp. Share back on. Last but not least, you should get a Pokémon that knows Sweet Scent so you can force horde encounters.  , A good tool for EV spreads for Gens I through V is Smogon, but if you're training a Pokémon new to X/Y, you'll have to either look up EV spreads online or use Pokémon Showdown, an online battling simulator. Just go to Teambuilder, click New Team, choose the OU format and click Add Pokémon.   Type in your Pokémon and its Ability and Nature. You can fill in the moves depending on what role you'd like it to play on your team. After you do this, click the box under Stats and there should be a long button on top, which recommends a spread based on the moves you chose. This isn't perfect, but it's definitely a good start if you're not sure. If you know what EV spread you'd like, we can move on to deciding which Pokémon to fight against.  , Each Pokémon gives a pre-determined numbers of EVs in a stat. To find the one you want to train against, go to Nugget Bridge's article on EV Training Hotspots and scroll down to Hordes. Depending on what stats you're training in, it will give which Pokémon are the best for which stat and where to find them. After choosing, head off to the spot specified.

These devices are built with an angled opening to make it easier to urinate in without spilling. They are also very large and can usually accommodate multiple urinations.Hospital bottles are available online or through licensed medical providers. They can usually be purchased for a relatively low cost.; , In choosing a bottle, it's important to select a bottle that is an appropriate size. While it's impossible to accurately predict precisely how much urine you will excrete, you can ensure that your bottle is large enough to contain an average person's urine volume. Every person's body is different, but urine volumes generally range between 120 ml and 465 ml, or approximately four to 16 fluid ounces.Choose a bottle that can hold at least 465 ml, or approximately 16 ounces.If the bottle is bigger than that, it shouldn't be a problem. Remember: it's better for a bottle to be too big than too small. The average soda bottle size is 12 fluid ounces, or approximately 355 ml. Larger soda bottles come in 1.75 liter sizes (1750 ml, or approximately 59 fluid ounces), but remember that a soda bottle of any size will have a very narrow opening.Sports drink bottles like Gatorade and Powerade tend to have a wider mouth. For example, Gatorade offers a 20 fluid ounce (approximately 591 ml) bottle designed to have a wide mouth opening. Because of this, many people prefer using sports drinks bottles to urinate into., Whether you're alone in a car or tent, or have others with you, it's important to mark your designated pee bottle to avoid any potential confusion.You can keep it simple by drawing a big ""X"" on the bottle in permanent marker, or be more explicit in your message (like ""Do not drink,"" for example).  , Female urination devices, or FUDs, are essentially small funnels built for women to urinate standing up or into a bottle. There are many brands of FUDs, including GoGirl and Freshette, which can be used by women who need to urinate but can't find a toilet.To use an FUD, simply hold the funnel under your vagina, relatively close to your body. Urinate into the device, and angle the narrow end into the mouth of a bottle.You can find an FUD online or at many retail stores, including outdoor gear stores.  , In addition to the actual bottle, you'll need to bring adequate cleanup supplies. If you're a woman, this will mean bringing toilet paper or tissues to wipe up with. You'll also need soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, regardless of gender., If at all possible, retreat to a secluded location. If you are in a car, being seen by others shouldn't be a problem. If you're at a crowded event, like a sports match or a parade, and cannot get to a restroom, urinating in a bottle will be a little more difficult. You want to avoid being seen, as it is both embarrassing and illegal to expose yourself to others.   Find a place where you can be alone and won't be seen by anyone else. This may mean stepping into a stairwell or hiding behind a building, depending on where you are. Use your best judgment and be discreet. Do not call attention to yourself, and again, make sure no one will see you.  , If you're using a hospital bottle, the actual act of urinating will be fairly easy. The bottle has an angled top to prevent spilling and splash-back. However, if you're using an empty drink bottle, you'll need to angle the bottle to ensure it doesn't spill or overflow. Simply tilt the bottle at an angle to your body so that your urine flows against the bottom of the bottle, ideally at the downward-angled part of the bottle's bottom.If you're a woman, you'll need to wipe up afterwards. This will require having toilet paper on hand. Be sure to wipe front to back in order to avoid a potential urinary tract infection, which can happen if bacteria from the rectal area is introduced into the bladder-opening area., Once you've finished relieving yourself, you'll need to properly dispose of the bottle. It is illegal to dispose of human waste on the side of the road because of the serious health and sanitation hazards that roadside workers and landscapers face. In fact, in some states, there is an enhanced litter charge for anything deemed ""dangerous litter."" For example, in Wyoming (and numerous other states across the U.S.), getting caught disposing of urine on the side of the road can result in a nine month jail sentence.Be sure the cap is securely tightened on the mouth of the bottle. This will ensure that the bottle will not spill if tipped or dropped. Store the bottle in a secure location on your person or in your car. When you reach a trashcan or restroom facility, you can either throw the bottle in the trash, or pour the urine into a toilet.  , After urinating, it's important to wash your hands. If you are able to access running water and have soap on hand, lather the soap between your hands and rinse them under running water for approximately 20 seconds. This will help prevent the spread of germs and reduce the chances of getting yourself or others sick.If you cannot access running water, which may be the case since you could not access a toilet, you should still clean your hands with antibacterial hand sanitizer or hand wipes. These alcohol-based products kill bacteria on your hands, helping to prevent the spread of germs.To use hand sanitizer, simply squirt out enough of the product to adequately cover your hands and rub both hands together, covering all fingers and hand surfaces until the product dries., If you're prone to frequent urination, or if you know you will be in a situation in which you won't have access to a restroom, you may want to avoid drinking fluids before and during that situation. For example, if you're going to be on a long car trip, limit your fluid intake for one or two hours before you depart, and restrict how much you drink during the trip.Do not deprive yourself completely. If you are thirsty, you should absolutely drink some water to prevent dehydration. Just try to limit how much you drink to avoid emergencies.Avoid diuretics like coffee, tea, cola, and other caffeinated beverages. Diuretics increase the frequency and urgency of urination, which may create an emergency situation when restrooms are not available., Over time, going to the bathroom when you don't really have to go will make your bladder accustomed to feeling the urge without having a full bladder. As part of a long-term bathroom habit, it's best to hold off on urinating until you actually need to.However, if you're embarking on a road trip or visiting a place with poor restroom access, you may want to consider urinating whenever the opportunity presents itself.Plan bathroom breaks into every trip or outing. Try to anticipate where you will and won't be able to access a restroom, and plan accordingly.Don't rush. Allow yourself to complete your urination, or you may find yourself feeling the urge later on.It's also best to allow urine to flow at a natural pace, rather than squeezing pelvis to force it out faster., Most urinary urges most likely stem from simply drinking too many fluids or ingesting too much of a diuretic. Other urinary urges stem from abdominal pressure from factors like pregnancy or being overweight.However, some urinary urges may be caused by an underlying medical problem. Talk to your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms:   bloody urinediscolored urine (especially red or dark brown in color)pain during urinationdifficulty urinatingincontinence (loss of bladder control)fever","['doctor', 'cleanup supplies', 'practice good bathroom habits', 'limit fluids', 'appropriate size', 'bottle', 'hospital bottle', 'fud', 'discreet place', 'travel']"

Begin by writing down any goal that comes to mind. For example, write down “make captain of the football team.” Even if you aren’t sure it’s a realistic goal, it’s okay to write it down at this point. You can narrow down your goals later.Write your goals on a poster and stick it above the desk that you look at each day.; , You may be excited and making all kinds of goals, but it’s better to pace yourself once you’ve written your initial goals down. Choose specific, realistic goals or even one single but very important goal. When it comes to choosing your goal, ensure that it states precisely what it is that you want to achieve. Write these down in a journal and keep it with you at home and school.For example, instead of saying you want to study more, say that you want to study for three hours every night during the school week.  , Now that you’ve written down specific goals, separate them into either immediate or long-term goals. An immediate goal would be to organize all of your notes and schoolwork. A long-term goal would be to make honor roll at then end of the year. Keep the immediate and long-term goals on separate pages., There are certain things you won’t be able to set deadlines for, like final tests and tryouts for teams. But, you do need to make deadlines for goals that don’t have set dates. For example, if you want to learn a certain amount of vocabulary words for the SAT, set a number for a specific date. Write down that date in your notebook and keep it in mind as the year progresses.It’s also helpful to write down the dates of things that are out of your control, like final tests.  , Seeing all of your goals written down can be overwhelming. A positive attitude is essential when it comes to achieving your goals. You can maintain a positive attitude by thinking of the positive things that happen in your day, considering your strengths, and remembering that everyone has a bad day sometimes.Write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal in a positive way. For example, instead of writing “Stop failing vocabulary quizzes,” you can write “Improve grades on vocabulary quizzes.” Be open with a friend or family member about your feelings and worries.  , Getting organized will make it easier to stay on top of achieving your goals. Organize your backpack, locker, notebooks, and anything else that holds your schoolwork or other paperwork. Determine what you need and get rid of the junk. Keep your things organized throughout the school year.Spend 10 minutes on organization when you get home from school every day.  , It’s easy to get distracted and do something that sounds like more fun than work. A little bit of procrastination is normal, so don’t get mad at yourself if it happens. Instead, work on overcoming procrastination. Do things like prioritizing your tasks, starting with the hardest task, and breaking your tasks down into 15 minute chunks.Set small periods of time each week for TV and internet use that isn't for research purposes. Don't allow these times to bleed into study time or to replace it.  , Skipping classes will only prevent you from achieving your goals. Try to never skip class unless it is for a good reason, like sickness. Take every class seriously and take notes. If you do miss class, ask your teacher and schoolmates what you missed., It’s normal to struggle with something at some point in school. Even if you’re not struggling, be curious and ask questions. This will help you learn more and be prepared to take on your goals. Ask for extra help from a tutor or parent if you find that you aren’t understanding something on your own.Ask the question to your teacher after class if you’re not comfortable raising your hand in class.  , Keep a personal planner with you at all times. Buy a planner that includes the dates you will be in school and has enough room to write things down. First, write down all of the permanent due dates. Then, write down your daily assignments and weekly goals. Keep up the planner for the rest of the year.You can also keep a calendar on your wall.  , Occasionally, when you've achieved certain milestones in your goal plan, take a break and reward yourself. See a favorite movie, visit a friend who lives across town, go to the ice cream parlor with your friends, or buy yourself something new. If you don't have the money to purchase rewards for yourself, find ways to reward yourself that don't cost anything.   This can include setting aside a favorite game or activity only for when you earn it.  , You are going to make mistakes during the process of achieving your goals. That is completely normal and expected. Even if it’s not you making a mistake, you’re going to encounter some kind of obstacle. Don’t let these problems overwhelm you. Gather your thoughts, readjust your efforts, and maintain a positive mindset.Break down your goals into smaller chunks if you find that your initial list was not possible.  , Once you’ve gone through the first part of the school year, make a list for the second half. You may have some goals that you haven’t accomplished yet, and that’s okay. Put those goals at the top of your new list. Write down a few other realistic and manageable goals., At some point during the year, you will need to evaluate your progress. Think of what you’ve accomplished so far. You should also consider what you need to work on. Once you’ve done that, you can figure out what you need to do to get better as the year goes on.You can review your progress halfway through the year, or do it once a month.  , Sleep is very important, especially when you’re keeping up with a busy school schedule. Don’t overwhelm yourself so much that you lose out on sleep. Try to maintain a sleeping schedule. Go to bed at the same time every night and get at least eight hours of sleep.Avoid caffeine and other stimulants, like television screens, before you go to bed.  , Hard work is necessary but so is relaxation. Overwhelming yourself can lead to exhaustion and mood problems, which could prevent you from achieving your goals. Do things like sports, meditation, or writing to help you relax.Exercising can also help you sleep better.

Research the average date of the last frost in your area, and plant your jicama one to two weeks after this date.The jicama plant may not grow properly if you live in an environment that stays mostly cold.; , Unless you already have seeds, you will need to obtain them. Jicama seeds can be purchased at a nursery, some home improvement stores, or even online. Check the packet to make sure you have the right seeds before planting., Put the jicama seeds in lukewarm water to speed up germination. Place seeds in a shallow pan of warm water. Allow them to sit for 24 hours. Then, remove the seeds from the water., Look for a place in your garden that receives at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day. The spot you choose to grow the jicama will have an effect on the outcome of the harvest. The location you choose should be exposed to full sun for the duration of the six to eight hours., Choose a location with moist but well-drained soil. Make sure the soil is alkaline with a pH over 7. You can test this easily with a commercial pH tester.If you want to grow the seeds before the last frost, then you can plant them in a pot indoors. You should use planting soil, perlite, or vermiculite, and a little peat moss in a medium-sized pot. The pot should be placed under a grow light or by a sunny windowsill. If you start with the seeds in a pot, wait for them to grow to 3 in (7.6 cm) tall before you plant them in the garden.  , If you decide to plant the seeds in a pot before the frost, you will need to take care of the seeds. Once you have planted them in a medium-sized pot with planting soil, water the seeds regularly until the last frost. Water the seeds until the soil is moist any time the soil feels dry.  , Make the holes about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) in depth. The amount of holes you dig depends on the amount of seeds you have to plant. The holes should be about 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart. If you plant more than one row, then the rows should be 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) apart., You can dig the holes first, or dig them as you plant the seeds. The soil should feel moist and warm without you watering it first. Cover the seeds and tamp them down lightly. , Sprinkle water over the soil after you plant and then when it becomes dry. Do not saturate the seeds with water, even if the soil is dry. The soil should only feel moist once you sprinkle the water.Using a watering can will help regulate how much water you pour onto the soil.  , You can use an all-purpose fertilizer. The exact instructions for fertilizing depends on the directions on the package of your fertilizer. Typically, you just need to apply the fertilizer around the base of the plant. You can purchase fertilizer at a nursery or at many home improvement stores.Ask an employee at your nursery for fertilizer recommendations if you aren’t sure about which brand to buy.  , Jicama vines grow quite tall, so they will need support as they grow. Stake the vines when they are about 24 inches (61 cm) in length. Place wooden tomato stakes about 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep into the soil next to the jicama vine. Loosely tie each plant with twine., Don’t forget to keep the soil moist as the jicama grows. Test the soil out by feeling it with your hand or gently digging into it with your fingers. Only water when the soil is dry since jicama does not do well with over-watering., Remove the tiny flowers that bloom on the jicama. Removing the flowers encourages stronger root growth. You can remove them with your hand, scissors, or pruners., Jicama is not likely to have pest problems during growth. This is because the flowers, seeds, and leaves are poisonous. If you do find that you have a pest problem, remove the pests yourself, or use an organic pest spray.Make sure you know what type of pests you are targeting when you go to buy pest spray.  , Unearth the tubers from the ground using a trowel. Wait until late fall, but before the first frost to dig your tubers. This will be approximately 150 days from the time of planting. Unearth the tubers earlier than that if the vine shows signs of dying. Be careful to avoid injuring the tubers during removal. Take your time.The tubers should be 3-6 inches (7.6-15.2 cm) in diameter.  , The tubers should be firm and round. Tubers that are soft and shriveled with visible cracks and/or bruising should probably be thrown out. Brush the soil off of the tubers.Gently soak or wash them into water to remove clumps of mud or soil. Allow them to dry.<  , Jicama plants will deteriorate if they are stored in a location below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). Ideally, store them in a location that is 53 to 60 degrees (11 to 15 degrees Celsius). This may be in a garage or heated basement. The location you choose should be dry. It should not be wet or humid. The jicama should be fresh and ready to eat for up to two months if stored properly.You can store the jicama in bowls, racks, or pans.

Find one with smooth skin that is dark purple or black without too many bruises or blemishes.; , Rinse the eggplant thoroughly in cool water, making sure to scrub away any dirt from the surface of the skin. You may want to use a vegetable scrub brush, especially if your eggplant is from a farmer's market and still has bits of soil on it.  , Place the eggplant on its side on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut off the tip of the eggplant from the smaller end, taking care to remove the green cap and stem. Next, slice the eggplant according to your taste. Choose from the following common ways of slicing eggplant to prepare it for baking:   Slice it in half lengthwise. This is the simplest, most straightforward method, and is a great option if you're working with small eggplants. Each half of the eggplant will account for one serving. Place the eggplant on the cutting board and carefully slice it from tip to tip.       Slice it into discs. This is another popular method for preparing baked eggplant. Discs of eggplant may be baked by itself or used as the foundation for more complicated dishes, like stuffed eggplant. Place the eggplant on its side on the cutting board and use a knife to slice it into discs of equal width.       Slice it into cubes. Since eggplant breaks down when it bakes, slicing it into cubes results in a softer, creamier baked dish overall. To prepare it this way, slice the eggplant into discs, then slice each disc into quarters.        , Place the cut eggplant on a baking sheet lined with paper towels and use a liberal amount of salt on the open side of the eggplant slices. Salting helps draw out the extra water, so the baked eggplant will turn out less watery and mushy. It also prevents the eggplant from soaking up too much oil. You can skip this step if you're in a hurry, but it's worth doing if you want the texture of your eggplant to turn out perfectly., As the salt sits on the eggplant slices, you will see droplets of water begin to bead and drip from the fruit. If you don't see this occurring, sprinkle more salt on the eggplant.  , Carefully squeeze the water into a bowl or the sink, then pat the eggplant slices with paper towels to absorb the excess moisture. Be careful not to squeeze too hard and crush the eggplant.  ,, Lay the eggplant cut-side up on a baking sheet. Drizzle the eggplant with olive oil or another type of vegetable oil. Use a pastry brush or the back of a spoon to smooth the oil over the eggplant until the flesh is lightly coated all over. Sprinkle the slices with salt and pepper.  , Place the eggplant in the oven and bake it until the inside is creamy and the edges and surface have turned brown and crispy, about 20 minutes.   If you'd like cheesy eggplant, remove it from the oven and sprinkle it with Parmesan, cheddar, or goat cheese. Place it back in the oven for another 5 minutes, until the cheese is melted. For another variation, try tomato garlic eggplant. Place tomato halves and garlic cloves around the eggplant slices and bake them together for 30 minutes.  ,","['sliced eggplant', 'oven', '° c', 'eggplant', 'good eggplant', 'saltwater', 'kosher salt', 'eggplant slices', 'minutes']"

Tests are usually based off of material discussed in class or from previous assignments, and if you don’t keep up, it will be hard to do well.   Before the test, teachers often discuss the format of the exam or give advice on how to study, and if you’re not present you could miss crucial information. If you have to miss class or can’t turn in an assignment, ask a classmate or friend to borrow notes. Also, try to complete the assignment even if you can’t receive credit so you’re better prepared for the test.; , Writing out information will help you remember it, so taking good notes in class or when you’re studying will help ensure you get a great grade on the test.Having clearly written and well-organized notes will also make studying a lot easier. If you already have notes from class, try recopying them before the exam. This will be a more effective study strategy than simply re-reading them.  , Organizing your study materials will make it a lot easier to prepare for the test. It also helps you feel more in control, confident, and ready to tackle the exam.   Use a binder or folder to keep track of and group your notes. A planner or calendar can help you remember test dates and due dates, and you can also schedule regular study sessions.  , Familiarizing yourself with the format of the test will help you be as prepared as possible when you sit down to take it. Take the time to do research and ask your teacher questions about the test format.   If this is a standardized exam that many people all over your state or country take, look up some information online about the test. Pay attention to the type of questions they ask, the time limits, and look for any specific test-taking tips or resources that might be available. If it's an exam for a specific class, ask the teacher if they can tell you about the format of the exam. They might be willing to give you some details  , Taking tests is stressful, especially when you feel a lot of pressure to do well, but negative thoughts can limit your ability to successfully study for the test. Try to push these negative thoughts aside, and replace them with more positive ones.Instead of focusing on how you are going to fail the exam or fail the class if you don’t do well on the test, remind yourself that you’ve been working hard and preparing. Tell yourself that you’re going to do well. Try visualizing yourself easily answering the questions on the test.  , Although it can be tempting to wait until the last minute to cram for an exam, it won’t help you learn the material or ace the test. The earlier you begin studying, the more prepared you’ll be for the exam.Studying right before the test often makes you feel more panicked and it limits your ability to learn and correctly recall information. While it might depend on how important the test is and how much material you have to get through, it’s a good idea to start studying at least one week in advance. If it’s a bigger test such as the SAT, ACT, LSAT, or GRE, you will probably want to spend several months preparing.  , When you begin studying, the amount of material you have to get through can seem overwhelming. To keep from feeling as stressed out and to make your studying more effective, split your studying up so you are only reviewing small amounts of material at one time.For example, instead of trying to memorize a long list of vocabulary terms or definitions all at once, break up the list and focus on small parts each time you study. You will retain the information better and get through the list much faster. It can also be helpful to switch up the material you are studying. For example, try working one type of math problem during one sitting and then switch to a different type of math problem for your next study session. Your brain has to work harder to decide which strategy to use to solve the problem. Don’t stick to one topic; instead, study a bunch of different material in one sitting.Try to split up your studying into 25 to 50 minute intervals, and take breaks in between. You’ll feel more relaxed while studying and also get through the information more effectively.Education experts describe this technique as “spaced repetition” and have found that it’s much more effective than trying to memorize lots of material all at once., Although you might feel like you need to focus exclusively on your studying, research has shown that taking regular breaks will improve your focus when you return to studying and keep you calm before the test.While you can choose to do anything you enjoy during your break, researchers have concluded that exercise improves your memory and lowers your blood pressure. Walk, jump rope, dance, or jog during your break and get pumped to ace your test. Yoga has also been shown to improve focus and attention span, which might come in handy when taking a test.  , Music, phones, and the television can all distract you while you’re studying, so it’s best to eliminate them while you’re preparing for the exam.If you have to listen to music in the background, choose instrumental music or classical music. Turn your phone off or put it in another room so you’re not tempted to text, check or your email, or use social media. If you need the computer to study, disable email alerts, messaging functions, or anything else that might distract you from your goal of doing well on the test.  , Although most of us have stayed up all night studying for a test before, it’s not an effective study approach if you want to avoid getting F’s on tests. It will make you feel more anxious, less prepared, and will interfere with your ability to remember the material you stayed up all night studying.Instead of pulling an all nighter, review the material once more before you go to bed, and make sure you get plenty of sleep. Your brain will keep working to remember the information while you are sleeping. One psychology study found that pulling an all-nighter actually hurt your ability to reason and remember information for up to 4 days after you stayed up all night.  , While you might have a go-to study spot such as the library or your room when preparing for a test, holing up in one location can actually keep you from remembering the information as effectively. So, instead of remaining in one place, switch locations.A quiet coffee shop, a bench outside, and an empty classroom are all great places to try.  , While it might sound silly, telling yourself a crazy or funny story about the material can help you remember it more quickly and clearly. This technique works particularly well for ordered lists, formulas, or anything with an acronym.The story doesn’t have to make sense or be real, it’s just to help you recall the material.  , When preparing for a test, many of us focus on re-reading chapters and highlighting or underlining material. Research indicates, however, that these methods are not as effective as creating flashcards or taking practice tests.   Make flashcards with a friend and then quiz each other. You could also ask a parent or sibling to quiz you with the flashcards. If there is a practice test available for the test you are about to take, make sure you take advantage of this resource. Give yourself the appropriate amount of time so you are taking the practice test under the same circumstances that you will take the actual test. If there isn’t a practice test available, try making your own. If you have a general idea of the test’s format, the act of writing and answering the questions will help you learn and retain the information.  , When you’re studying for a test, read information out loud. It helps you learn the material more quickly and effectively because you are seeing the information as well as hearing it.   Try reading your notes out loud.

This starts the conversation out on the right foot, leading to better tips on average, and gives them a polite way to get your attention later.Multitask by introducing yourself as you pass out the menus and check that every customer has enough silverware and napkins.  , When speaking to customers, always use respectful terms of address such as sir, ma'am, and miss. Act friendly and positive, and make your customers feel as comfortable as possible.   Ask the customer whether they have dined at your restaurant before -- that way if they are new, first-time customers you can welcome them and offer your help with the menu. Appear friendly, but do not get involved in the customer's conversation unless asked. Do your job, then leave the customer to eat or talk in relative privacy. Always remember to smile. No matter how irritating customers or co-workers can be, just put on a pleasant face and suck it up -- this will save you a lot of drama! Don't talk or gossip about customers even when you think they can't hear you. Remain polite and respectful when discussing them in case they are in earshot.  , Never sit down at the table to take an order. Don't shake hands or hug unless you are personal friends with the customer, or you are shaking hands to greet them as per restaurant policy. Other physical interactions depend on the atmosphere of the place you work, and whether you are a man or woman.   Studies of U.S. restaurants show that women who touch a customer lightly on the shoulder, hand, or arm receive better tips from that customer on average.This should only be done when the customer appears relaxed and comfortable, and never if the customer is on a date with a woman. Be friendly rather than flirtatious.  , If a customer asks for advice, be prepared to answer whatever questions they have or recommend your favorite dish in each category. If a customer orders a dish that gets a lot of complaints, try to recommend another option.   Customers like it when you give them the ""inside scoop"", but you shouldn't go so far as to insult a dish unless you work in an unusually relaxed environment. Instead, steer them away from a bad dish by recommending a similar, better option as ""the chef's specialty"" or ""my personal favorite"".  , Many people have serious reasons to avoid certain ingredients, including potentially fatal allergies. If you aren't familiar with every dish on the menu (which you should be), do your best to find out for them how it is prepared.   Never lie to a customer and give them an ingredient they requested to have removed. If you can't accommodate the request, simply say so and suggest a similar alternative that the customer can eat. Don't question your customers. Keep in mind there are many reasons for menu change requests, such as religious, vegetarian/vegan and cultural dietary restrictions. If the request can be accommodated, don't ask why they made it!  , Studies of U.S. establishments show that waitstaff who repeat the order to the customers receive more tips.However big or small that effect might be, it also gives the customer a chance to correct any mistakes or change their mind.  , If you just got a job as a waiter or waitress, it may take some time to get a feel for how frequently you should check on each table. At least check in whenever they are finishing a course or if they look bored or irritated while waiting for their food.   Give them a specific time estimate if they ask how long the food will take, whenever possible. Stop by to refill your customers' glass whenever it gets low, or to ask if they'd like to purchase another for non-refillable drinks.  , Always ask whether the customer is finished before removing dishes with food on them. If there is a lot of food left, ask whether the food was all right.   Many restaurants allow their waitstaff to give unsatisfied customers something extra to make up for bad experiences. This could save your tip.  , Be friendly to people you would not normally talk to. When someone sits in your section more than once, take the time to get to know them. You don't need to become fast friends, but you will probably end up getting to like at least some of them.   Remember their names and favorite drinks, where they work etc. Make them feel like they are going to a restaurant to visit a friend: you! Try to write down the appearance and preferences of anyone who visits more than once. The customer will be impressed if you know how they like their steak on the third visit.  , Ask if there is anything more you can get for them, and that will open the opportunity for them to ask for dessert, a take-out item/bag, or the check.   If they state they need nothing else, then ask if they are ready for the check. If they have to ask you, it generally means they are in a hurry, or you have waited an excessive amount of time since you last checked on the table. Never ask the customer if they need change. Say ""I will be right back with your change,"" then come back and leave the full amount on the table.

Airbnb’s simple “Where,” “When,” and “Who” boxes make this easy and intuitive. Click “Search” once you have the information down., You’ll then see a list of all the available rentals for your chosen locations and dates. You can narrow these down by selecting only those with a certain number of rooms, or within a certain price range.Since you’re traveling with a family, it might be very helpful to look for rentals with multiple rooms available, or entire houses/apartments. After doing a general search for listings in a location, click on ""Filters"" below the results to narrow things down by these categories.  , Traveling with a family means more people that want to be entertained. Luckily, Airbnb also lets you sort properties based on whether things like televisions, wi-fi, or a kitchen are available. Take advantage of these to find just what each of your family members wants.These options will also be available via the ""Filters"" menu shown below the search results.  , Airbnb rentals that are happy to accommodate children can be labeled as such. However, this can mean lots of different things. If might mean that the host has games, toys, or other things that might keep children happy, or it might just mean that the host is willing to allow children in the home.There is also a filter specifically for the ""Family/Kid-friendly"" label.  , You can book Airbnb through a Facebook account, or use an email address. When you sign in, follow the prompts to create a profile. You can then access your account to use Airbnb’s communications features. If you’re looking for specific needs, like no staircases (to help keep a toddler safe), contact the host directly and ask about this.  Even if a listing does not have a “Family/Kid-Friendly” label, let the host know you are traveling with family. They may have games, movies, or other things that will make your stay great. They might also have tips about good places for families to visit in the area.  , Once you’ve found the listing that will make your whole family happy, enter your card information to book the home. You should then receive an email confirmation that includes the details of your upcoming stay, and information about how to contact the host and Airbnb., Many Airbnb rentals provide guests with access to a kitchen. Try cooking some meals during your vacation instead of eating out all the time. This will cut down on a major vacation expense, and also give your family opportunities to relax and spend more time together.Visit some markets in the area and pick up a few local delicacies to make the cooking experience more special.  , A nice perk of Airbnb is getting to spend time in a home that’s a different type than yours. Make the most of this during your vacation. For instance:If you’re staying in a suburban home with a big backyard, use it as an opportunity to play catch with your family. If If you’re staying in a high-rise apartment, take some time out to look at the city lights at night while sharing ice cream with everyone.  , Airbnb’s motto is “Don’t go there. Live there.” Many Airbnb listings are located away from popular tourist areas. This gives you the opportunity to soak up more of the local flavor of your area. Go off the beaten path and look for some family fun near your Airbnb home. For instance:Look for family-friendly restaurants nearby that cater to locals more than tourists. Visit fun attractions that might be overlooked by sightseeing guides. Maybe there’s a great putt putt course or park just around the corner!  , Airbnb gives guests opportunities to review the homes they stay in. You can read these online as you search for listings. They can give you a good sense of what a home and host are like. The reviews tend to be positive, so if you do see something negative about a home, take it seriously. Contact the host if you have any questions., Listings on Airbnb may include guidelines that the host sets for how you are permitted to use their home. You are expected to abide by these, so if there’s something in the rules that won’t work for your family, choose another location.For example, if the house rules ask guests not to touch a priceless pottery collection on display, you might want to choose a different location if you’re traveling with a toddler.  , Airbnb does its best to vet and verify hosts and accommodations. A few bad apples might show up, however. When communicating with a potential host about a listing, think twice if they do things like ask you to pay off site (which is against Airbnb’s policy). If you sense anything that feels like a scam, chose another listing., Listings on Airbnb will include pictures so that potential guests can get a sense of what’s being offered. Since you’re relying on the hosts to be truthful about the listing, you can double-check any important things. For instance, if the listing says it includes two bedrooms, but the pictures only show one, ask the host to send a picture of the other one before you book., Every booking on Airbnb includes a free 24-hour concierge service. If you need any help during your stay, or if you run into issues with the host or the accommodations, call this service right away. The number should be included in the confirmation information you received after booking.Airbnb wants customers to be satisfied and to have a great experience. You can request a refund if the accommodations were not as described.

If it's a toy that you brought, make sure that you washed it thoroughly ahead of time and that it is not too small to play with. If the baby starts sucking on the toy don't be grossed out or alarmed, as this is a way for the baby to further explore the toy will their sense of taste. Here are a few good toys to bring for the baby if you are bringing toys:   rattles small stuffed animals/stuffed dolls/stuffed puppets (as long as the toys is not too small and that the toy isn't a dollar store one as if the baby is teething, he/she may break pieces off of the toys and swallow it) water toys like funnels and rubber ducks (it's best not to let baby suck on these toys, and while near the water when playing will the toys, keep a firm grip on the baby and do not let the baby fall in or put the baby in intentionally)  , Try bringing a picture book or a kid-friendly magazine like National Geographic Kids or Chirp so that you can show the baby the pictures in the magazine/book. You can also simply change baby's surroundings a bit. Do this by taking a bit of a walk inside or outside the house, letting them look out the window, or turning on the T.V, changing it to a kid-friendly channel like Treehouse, or TVO Kids. You can also let them study your face if they haven't seen you before or if they haven't seen you often. If they are familiar with you, try making funny faces (like 'fish' faces, sticking your tongue out and so on) at them and see if you get a reaction.  , For touch, tickle them, rub different textured things (like felt, faux fur, a soft fabric and so on) against their skin, blow gently on their skin, and walk your fingers up their arms and legs. For sight, show them pictures from kid-friendly magazines and picture books, change their surroundings, and make funny faces (see previous step for more). For hearing, make different sounds/noises (ring a bell, tap your fingernail against something, and so on), whistle and make clucking noises with your tongue, and simply talk to them using different tones and pitches. For taste, let them suck on their thumbs and toys (see step 2 for a little more on this), and possibly give them a new flavour of baby food or something like that. For smell, bring a few mildly smelly things with you (flowers are ideal) and let them smell them (don't let them suck on it though!).  , This can be quite entertaining for both the baby, and you! Also, if they say something that sounds like it could be developed into a word (for example, if they say 'ma, mama, da, or dada' say, 'daddy', or 'mommy'.)  , You can try to think of more games, but here are a few suggestions:   Peek-A-Boo--- First, hide your face with your hands. Say, ""Where am I? Where is *insert your name here*?"" Then, remove your hands and say, ""Peek-A-Boo! Here I am!"" Put a happy, excited expression on your face as you remove your hands. Do this a few more times. As baby becomes familiar with the game, gently take baby's hands, and put them over their face without touching their hands to their face. Then say, ""Where are you? Where is *insert baby's name here*?"" Then, remove their hands from their face and say, ""Peek-A-Boo! There you are!"" This game is a really fun and exciting game for babies. I Spy Junior--- First, say ""I Spy with my little eye..."" name the thing that you are thinking of, and then describe the object. For example, if your item is baby's bib and it is pink with a purple giraffe on it, say ""I Spy with my little eye, baby's pink bib with a purple giraffe!"" You could also say, ""I Spy with my little eye, baby's bib! It is pink, and it has a purple giraffe on it!"" If you can pick up the object, pick the object up and show it to them. Then say, ""Here is the *insert object's name here*!"" If you can't pick it up, walk over to the object and say, ""This is the *insert object name here*!"" Then describe it telling baby what colour it is, what the texture is like, and other interesting and important little details. Bouncing On Knee Games--- Sit down, and hold baby on your lap. Make sure that baby is in a sitting position. Then, bounce your knee up and down, but don't bounce it too much. While bouncing baby, recite a cute nursery rhyme or make up your own rhyme.  , Use some finger puppets, dollar store puppets, or even homemade ones. You can also use oragami figurines to put on the show. Try having baby as one of the characters! Give the character baby's name and make sure that the character is the main character and that the character is very kind and has a nice personality. Have fun with the show and try to make baby giggle and smile.  , Baby may not be able to understand the story/poem because of how young they are, but the baby will enjoy hearing your voice and will still have fun.  , If you are positive and have fun, baby will most likely have fun with you!

These tests are particularly helpful when you want to think about intangible skills like fortitude, kindness, creativity, or adaptability.   Try the University of Kent Strengths test.You could also take a Myers-Briggs Type Test.; , Whether you tend to be shy our outgoing, you probably have a number of valuable skills. Consider how you interact with others. Think about what intangible strengths (such as an outgoing nature or the ability to delegate) are apparent in your interaction style.   Do you enjoy working with other people on a group project, or would you rather work alone? In a group setting, do you tend to take the lead, or would you rather contribute by being a good foot soldier? Do you feel very sympathetic toward other people’s problems? Perhaps you are naturally caring and empathetic.Do you tend to notice things that others don’t? It sounds like you have great observation skills. Do you tend to be very at ease in social situations? You’re probably pretty outgoing.  , Some people tend to base their decisions on logic, whereas others care more about personal feelings. Both logic and emphasis on values are important strengths.For example, when you decide to buy a new sofa, if you spend hours reading consumer reports and comparison shopping, you probably value logic. On the other hand, if you sit on a sofa, think that it’s super comfy, and then decide to buy it, you base decisions more on personal feelings.  , Some people like to know what they’re doing well in advance. They like schedules and do a good job following them. Other people like to “go with the flow.” They prefer a flexible agenda. Both planning and flexibility are valuable skills.One way to think about this is to think about how you like to vacation. Do you spend hours on the internet before you leave on a trip, planning every stop? Or do you wait and see where the wind blows you?  , Flow is a state of mind in which you lose your sense of time because you’re paying so much attention to a task. When you’re in flow, you often feel very energized and engaged and good at what you’re doing. Then think about what kind of intangible skills go into this particular activity.   For example, do you lose yourself in art projects? Do you find yourself brimming with new ideas whenever you’re asked to design a project? If so, creativity may be one of your intangible strengths., Perhaps you are naturally athletic and were born with great eye coordination, and you don't have to practice much in order to sink free throws. On the other hand, maybe you make all of your free throws because you practice ten hours a week. Remember that both natural talents and learned skills are important! Don't write off any of your strengths because you have to work hard to maintain them., Do you like to dream up big ideas and try to put them into action? Are you more of a logical thinker? Are you better with numbers or words? Do you like hands-on activities and physical movement? Do you work well with others?   Jot down anything that comes to you at this point. You can always narrow later.  , Include everything that you like to do, even if you’re not that good at it. Write down your hobbies, any athletic teams you belong to, your favorite weekend activities, and so on. Here are some ideas to get you started-- do you enjoy any of these activities? arts and crafts (jewelry making, painting, pottery, coloring) theatre or public speaking dancing, singing, or playing a musical instrument sports cooking shopping hanging out with your friends gardening or yardwork  , You may have to get a little creative, but you can probably find something positive for each one, even the ones that don’t really seem like skills (like shopping or going to the movies with friends). For example:   jewelry making - attention to detail, patience, artistic eye gardening - planning ahead, attention to the big picture shopping - budgeting, attention to advertising and pricing hanging out with friends - good social skills, ability to work well in a group  , Are you a particularly good writer, because you majored in English? Did you take a Statistics course that will help you analyze data? Did you learn the basics of working in a lab in your Chemistry class? , This could include anything that you did for charity (like holding a bake sale or working at a food bank) or anything that you did as part of a club or organization. Include leadership positions you held, but don’t leave out times when you were just part of a group.For example, if you did a great job selling raffle tickets as part of the Fundraising Committee for your intramural softball team in college, write that down. If you apply for a position at an organization that values the ability to raise money or talk to potential donors, you may be able to say that that is one of your strengths. Remember that working as part of a team is a strength that many employers and schools value, so include any activities (like sports teams) that required you to do that. If you’re working with a therapist on listing your strengths to building self-confidence or for any other purpose, include activities even if you aren’t sure what strengths they may show. Your counselor may be able to help you recognize skills that you didn’t know you had. Again, you may want to ask others who were involved in these activities with you if they can help you come up with strengths you may not have thought of. Maybe you really motivated a teammate and weren’t aware of it, or maybe your friends think you’re great at planning social events., You may want to do this in a spreadsheet (as opposed to on a napkin over lunch) so that you can expand it later or use it for future positions. Include every job you have had in the last ten years. If you’re young and haven’t had much paid work, you’ll want to include things that seem small scale to you.Don’t forget things like:   babysitting mowing lawns helping out at your uncle’s business on the weekends cleaning out your grandma’s attic painting your neighbor’s garage  , For the purposes of this list, write down even the tiniest contribution that comes to mind. If you’re interviewing for a position, you won’t read this to future interviewers - it’s just a way of brainstorming. Think about anything you were ever proud of yourself for doing in a previous position or anything that you were asked to do on a routine basis.For example, if you worked at McDonalds and were routinely assigned cash register duty, perhaps your strengths include working with money, customer service, and multitasking. Assuming you’re on good terms with current and former bosses, you could ask them what they think your skills are. They may think of something you’ve overlooked.  , This should always be the first step when you’re planning for an interview. Look carefully at the requirements for the position to determine exactly what kind of candidate they’re looking for.If this is a job or internship application, look at the advertisement for the job.  , If you’re participating in a college interview at a school that values volunteerism, think about your strengths in that area. If you’re applying for a job that requires you to manage a large group of people, ask yourself when you’ve had to lead others or delegate tasks. , If possible, speak with people who are already a part of the organization that you’re interviewing with. Ask them about what skills and values the organization thinks are important. Ask them what strengths they bring to their organization. Depending on your relationship with this person, you might even want to ask them if there are problem areas in the organization. If they tell you, for example, that the company really needs to work on its social media presence, and you have a lot of experience promoting events on Facebook and Twitter, you’ll want to play up that strength in an interview. If you can’t talk to anyone at the organization, you may want to talk to someone at a similar organization or someone who knows about this industry or school. For example, if you’re applying for a job at Verizon, and your aunt works for Sprint, she might be a good source of information. Talk to your school counselor if you’re applying for colleges, or seek out Career Center staff at your school if you’re applying for an internship.  , Using the information you gleaned from job postings, websites, and talking to others, write down the skills and character traits that you think are most important for whatever you’re applying for. You may want to put this information in a spreadsheet. , What skills (both tangible and intangible) do you have that match well with the job posting or school’s ethos? Notice whether only one or two of your strengths match up with what they’re looking for, or whether there are a lot of things on both lists. Decide which strengths are most important to emphasize. Using the information you learned about the school or company and the lists of your own strengths, decide which ones are going to be the keys to success.Write out your answer. Be prepared to support your answer with evidence from previous jobs and your personal life. You may also want to make a note of how this skill will be valuable to the organization you’re interviewing with to remind them of why you’re a perfect fit.Don’t be tempted to claim you have strengths that you don’t, even if the company is looking for those particular strengths. For example, if they want someone who is good with Microsoft Excel, and you have never so much as opened a spreadsheet before, don’t claim this as a strength. Chances are good that they will catch on to your lie quickly. Instead, move down the list and find a strength that you can truly claim as your own. Also avoid overly cocky answers. “I’m the best social media expert on the market today,” not only sounds arrogant, but will probably come off as untrue. At the same time, don’t be afraid to toot your own horn! You have to make it clear that your strengths make you the perfect candidate for the position. Be polite and genuine.

Wash it if needed, following the manufacturer's instructions for using a washing machine. Don't forget to take it out of the machine quickly once washed, to avoid it getting smelly.  Spot cleaning is often more effective than washing the whole pillow.  , It could either sleep in its own little box or you could let it stay on the bed with you. Your pillow pet should be comfortable.  , If you want, tell him/her a story or sing/play him/her a lullaby like ""Appalachian Lullaby"" from Tanya Goodman. Don't forget to wish it goodnight!, Feed your pet a little bit of food once in a while to make your pet's stomach feel better. If your pet throws up, clean it up and help your pet relax. Make your pet take a nap. If your pet refuses to, tell your pet the throwing up and sickness will never go away.  , Have conversations with it; you can tell it anything as it won't talk!, Play with your pet every day. If your pet has a favorite ball, play with it.   Entertain the pillow pet with toys, play hide-and-seek together, and play your video games together.  , But be careful, there should be some sounds that make you sad, so don't watch anything with those sounds.  Make sure the show is TV-Y, TV-Y7, and TV-G, and the movie is G or PG. Blue's Clues, Team Umizoomi, Bubble Guppies, Max & Ruby, Little Einsteins, and Fanboy & Chum Chum are great examples of shows to watch together.  , Trips are fun! Your pet is probably sick of staying in your house all the time. Whether it is a cool vacation to Disney World or just a visit at Grandma's house, your pet will sure be glad you let it have a nice getaway.   If you are spending the night at a hotel, or a week at a hotel, be sure to bring everything you and your pet needs. If your pet has a favorite ball or blanket or whatever, be sure to bring it. If your pet can't sleep without that special blanket or teddy, and you forget it, tell your pillow pet you are very sorry and you will not forget it the next time you go on vacation and you will let your pet sleep with you.  , Take your pillow pet to a restaurant, a movie theater, museums, parks and more, This is great because you've both a little friend and something to sleep on or rest against. Sit by a window so you and your pet can look out the window and see how far up you two are. If your pet is scared being so high, comfort your pet and tell your pet it won't last for long and your pet will get used to it.  , If you are sleeping on a bunk, and you are sleeping on the top bunk, make sure your pet isn't afraid of high places.  , If you aren't allowed to, and you brought books and fun games, you can play some games. Games you and your pet might like to play are in the tips.  , When you had all your fun, pack up and get ready to leave. If your pet hides behind a couch or under the covers of your bed, ask them why your pet is hiding.

You also need to know the breakdown of the payment and how much goes to Principal-Interest-Taxes-Insurance (PITI).  If you have less than 20 percent equity in the home, you may also be paying private mortgage insurance (PMI) of .25 to 2 percent per year. Contact your homeowner's insurance carrier. You may be receiving discounts because you bundle multiple vehicles with your home or paying a penalty because one spouse has a history of claims. Since your insurance is part of your mortgage PITI, a change in the insurance can change the payment.; , The spouse who wants to keep the house needs to be realistic. A true equity buy-out, paying your spouse a lump sum for his share of the equity and removing his name from the mortgage and the deed, means you will have to qualify for a mortgage on your own. Mortgage lenders typically use 28 percent of the borrower's gross income as a benchmark. You can obtain a free copy of your personal credit report from the three primary credit reporting companies thanks to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The credit report through the FCRA will not include your credit score. The report is more critical, you can check it for inaccurate information and any issues you might be able to resolve before you attempt to refinance. There are several online tools for estimating your credit score. Look for one that does not require you to provide credit card information or sign up for a subscription to questionable credit monitoring services.  , Whether the housing market is volatile or sluggish, you need to know the current market value of the house, regardless of the mortgage. Tidy up the house and property. A solid appraisal will help with the refinancing. , Your appraiser will look at the neighborhood Comparative Market Analysis, CMA or ""comps,"" but it doesn't hurt to look into them on your own. You can check out what houses similar to yours are on the market for, but the key is not asking price, it is selling price. A real estate agent can run a report for you, or there are online tools for estimating the comps in your area., Equity buy-outs offers risks and rewards for both spouses. For the one who keeps the house, a buy-out means assuming the entire mortgage, but reaping the rewards if the house increases in value. For the spouse giving up his share, it means getting out from under the risk and burden of the mortgage and getting a fixed share without having to worry about the future of the housing market in that neighborhood.   The equity is calculated as the appraised value of the house minus the balance on the mortgage. If you've owned the house for less than five years, unless you made a substantial down payment or living in a hot housing market, you may be surprised at how little equity you have. For example, if you financed $250,000 for 30 years at 4.50 percent, after 5 years, you will only have paid off $22,000 or 9 percent of your loan.Compare current mortgage terms with your own. If interest rates have dropped, this may be a good time to look into refinancing. However, if rates have gone up, you may want to look at other alternatives than a new mortgage.  , If getting a mortgage on your own may be difficult or unfairly expensive, consider liquidating or trading other marital assets to pay off your spouse's share of the equity.   For example, if there is $22,000 in equity and it's not a good time to refinance, then an $11,000 loan or distribution from a savings account, or giving up an $11,000 claim on your spouse's 401K can be substituted for the equity cash payment. In amicable divorces, the judge will look at the fundamental fairness of the property agreement and accept most reasonable agreements. Consider a co-ownership agreement where one spouse occupies the house and pays the entire PITI obligation. However, if one defaults, the other partner must assume the mortgage or lose ownership of the property. Co-ownership works well in amicable divorces where there are short-term goals, such as keeping the home so that teen children can finish school or the occupying spouse finishes school or job-training to improve income enough to take on a solo mortgage.  , If your divorce is contested or communication breaks down during the divorce process, you can let the court craft the terms of the buy-out and force your ex-spouse to comply with documentation, deed, and asset transfer requirements.   It is better to make every effort to work it out with your spouse, even if you have to split the cost and sit down with an attorney to craft an equity buy-out agreement. The court's decision will not take personal feelings, market conditions, and future plans into account. The result may be a blunt force order with end results that don't work well for either party.  , If refinancing with a cash payment is the best option, you will need to time the new mortgage correctly. If you live in a community property state, refinancing can be complicated unless you wait until the divorce is final.If you must refinance immediately, consult a real estate attorney about the ramifications of community property laws on the transaction. Unless handled correctly, the refinanced loan could be considered a joint debt, defeating the purpose of the equity split., Both names remain on the deed and the loan, but the spouse who is staying in the house takes over the payments and receives credit for the additional equity that accrues during the co-ownership.  , Assuming you have the income and credit needed to refinance, you will have several different loan options to consider.   A conventional rate/term refinance trades the old mortgage for a new one. The balance of the old mortgage becomes the new loan amount. The problem with this type of loan is that you will have to come up with the cash to pay your spouse for his share of the equity. A cash-out refinance allows you to finance a combination of the outstanding balance and the equity, receiving a cash payment. This type of loan requires a favorable loan-to-value ratio and solid credit. There may be extra fees or a higher interest rate for this type of loan. If your ex-spouse is comfortable with his name remaining on the existing mortgage, you can take a home equity loan in your name to raise the needed cash payment. This is a good option if the existing mortgage has exceptionally good terms and is within less than three to five years of being paid off.  , Once the divorce is final and the equity payment is complete, the vacating spouse needs to execute a Quit-Claim deed in favor of the person keeping the house. Blank forms are available at most office supply stores or an attorney can draw one up for a reasonable cost. The deed should be filed with the county recorder's office as soon as possible. There is a small fee to file the document, usually under $20.

You can perform calculations without having to input any formulas or copy any cells. You will need a spreadsheet with several entries in order to create a Pivot Table.   You can also create a Pivot Table in Excel using an outside data source, such as Access. You can insert the Pivot Table in a new Excel spreadsheet.; , A pivot table is not always the answer you are looking for. In order to take advantage of the pivot table features, your spreadsheet should meet some basic criteria:Your spreadsheet should include at least one column with duplicate values. This basically just means that at least one column should have repeating data. In the example discussed in the next section, the ""Product Type"" column has two entries: ""Table"" or ""Chair"". It should include numerical information. This is what will be compared and totaled in the table. In the example in the next section, the ""Sales"" column has numerical data.  , Click the ""Insert"" tab at the top of the Excel window. Click the ""PivotTable"" button on the left side of the Insert ribbon.   If you are using Excel 2003 or earlier, click the Data menu and select PivotTable and PivotChart Report...   , By default, Excel will select all of the data on your active spreadsheet. You can click and drag to choose a specific part of the spreadsheet, or you can type the cell range in manually.   If you are using an external source for your data, click the ""Use an external data source"" option and click Choose Connection.... Browse for the database connection saved on your computer.  , After selecting your range, choose your location option from the same window. By default, Excel will place the table on a new worksheet, allowing you to switch back and forth by clicking the tabs at the bottom of the window. You can also choose to place the Pivot Table on the same sheet as the data, which allows you to pick the cell you want it to be placed.When you are satisfied with your choices, click OK. Your Pivot Table will be placed and the interface will change.  , When creating a Pivot Table, you are essentially sorting your data by rows and columns. What you add where determines the structure of the table. Drag a field from the Field List on the right onto the Row Fields section of the Pivot Table to insert the information.   For example, your company sells two products: tables and chairs. You have a spreadsheet with the number (Sales) of each product (Product Type) sold in your five stores (Store). You want to see how much of each product is sold in each store. Drag the Store field from the field list into the Row Fields section of the Pivot Table. Your list of stores will appear, each as its own row.  , Like the rows, the columns allow you to sort and display your data. In the above example, the Store field was added to the Row Fields section. To see how much of each type of product was sold, drag the Product Type field to the Column Fields section.  , Now that you have the organization laid out, you can add the data to be displayed in the table. Click and drag the Sales field into Value Fields section of the Pivot Table. You will see your table display the sales information for both of your products in each of your stores, with a Total column on the right.For all of the above steps, you can drag the fields into the corresponding boxes below the Fields list on the right side of the window instead of dragging them onto the table.  , Pivot tables allow you to add multiple fields to each section, allowing for more minute control over how the data is displayed. Using the above example, say you make several types of tables and several types of chairs. Your spreadsheet is records whether the item is a table or chair (Product Type), but also the exact model of the table or chair sold (Model).   Drag the Model field onto the Column Fields section. The columns will now display the breakdown of sales per model and overall type. You can change the order that these labels are displayed by clicking the arrow button next to the field in the boxes in the lower-right corner of the window. Select ""Move Up"" or ""Move Down"" to change the order.  , You can change the way values are displayed by clicking the arrow icon next to a value in the Values box. Select ""Value Field Settings"" to change the way the values are calculated. For example, you could display the value in terms of a percentage instead of a total, or average the values instead of summing them.   You can add the same field to the Value box multiple times to take advantage of this. In the above example, the sales total for each store is displayed. By adding the Sales field again, you can change the value settings to show the second Sales as percentage of total sales.  , When changing the ways values are calculated, you have several options to choose from depending on your needs.   Sum - This is the default for value fields. Excel will total all of the values in the selected field. Count - This will count the number of cells that contain data in the selected field. Average - This will take the average of all of the values in the selected field.  , The ""Report filter"" area contains the fields that enable you to page through the data summaries shown in the pivot table by filtering out sets of data. They act as the filters for the report. For example, setting your Store field as the filter instead of a Row Label will allow you to select each store to see individual sales totals, or see multiple stores at the same time.  , One of the key features of the Pivot Table is the ability to sort results and see dynamic reports. Each label can be sorted and filtered by clicking the down arrow button next to the label header. You can then sort the list or filter it to only show specific entries., Your pivot table will automatically update as you modify the base spreadsheet. This can be great for monitoring your spreadsheets and tracking changes. .  , Pivot tables make it extremely easy to change the location and order of fields. Try dragging different fields to different locations to come up with a pivot table that meets your exact needs.   This is where the pivot table gets its name. Moving the data to different locations is known as ""pivoting"" as you are changing the direction that the data is displayed.  , You can use a Pivot Chart to show dynamic visual reports. Your Pivot Chart can be created directly from your completed Pivot Table, making the chart creation process a snap.

"['learn from an instructor', 'understand when to let go', 'be careful not to execute a choke at full force during training', 'practice on someone healthy or able-bodied', 'begin from the ground', 'stand or kneel behind your opponent', ""wrap around your opponent's neck"", 'apply pressure', 'hold until unconscious', 'lay your opponent flat on the ground', 'monitor your opponent closely', 'administer cpr if necessary', 'try out traditional resuscitation techniques']",How to Choke Hold," As you begin learning the chokehold, have a qualified instructor supervise and teach you the movements. Judo instructors, specifically, have extensive experience and background on the chokehold and because holds are potentially fatal, they should be treated seriously. When executed correctly, a chokehold should render your opponent unconscious, but not cause any injury or significant pain.; , Because choke-holds can be dangerous, it's important that as you practice them, you are able to recognize when your opponent begins to lose consciousness. When this happens, it is good to immediately release pressure so your opponent can regain consciousness.   If your opponent begins tapping you or has obviously surrendered and submitted to defeat, let them go. Especially in practice, you don't want to continue applying pressure to your opponent when they have decided to let you win. You will be able to tell your opponent is beginning to lose consciousness by a generally limp feeling in the body, sudden lack of resistance, changing color of your opponent's face, or eyes closing., When a choke is executed correctly, it can render your opponent unconscious in as little as 8 to 13 seconds. As you practice and train, a good rule is to only hold a choke for 5 seconds. , The chokehold is a safe way to subdue someone, but when applying to older people, very young children, or those who suffer from cardiac disorders or hypertension it can cause more fatal damage. Use common sense here when practicing., As training begins, your opponent will not be able to remain standing if you perform a standing chokehold, so it's good to start practicing from the ground. This will prevent injury caused from falling to the ground and will also give you better control.Stabilizing your position will also increase your ability to use your entire body.  , This will give you the best leverage and will leave your opponent in a position that is more unstable and thus more difficult to escape. Leading your opponent into a position in which it is hard for them to put up resistance will give you the best control and freedom of action so you will be able to achieve the best choke., With your dominant arm, reach around your opponent's corresponding shoulder and hook your arm around their neck. The bend of your arm should rest in the middle of their neck, and your fist should rest near your opponent's opposite shoulder. Then, clasp both of your hands together or put your other arm on the back of your opponent's head.   Sometimes it's better to wrap your arm around your opponent's weaker side, because it will be harder for them to escape your hold. Use your judgement to determine which side will allow you a better grip. Practice getting an accurate hold with your hands the moment you begin the choke. If you continually release to adjust your position your opponent will have more opportunity to escape.  , Using your biceps and forearms, exert pressure on your opponent's neck around the carotid arteries, which are located on the right and left side of the neck.Using excessive force is not necessary, because the choke should depend more on technique and less on strength. If you find yourself having to rely on your strength, then your technique needs improvement., Look for signs like lack of resistance from your opponent, flushed face, or non-movement in the eyes. Once unconscious, release your opponent. They should regain consciousness within 10 to 20 seconds., This allows blood to flow naturally back to the brain after you have rendered them unconscious. Placing your opponent on their side and allowing their head to rest in their arm will prevent possible vomiting and will facilitate breathing., Pay attention to your opponent's breathing, making sure that their airway is open so breathing can be achieved easily.  , It should take your opponent less than 30 seconds to regain consciousness. After 30 seconds, if your opponent is still not breathing, contact medical authorities and begin CPR while waiting.If untrained in CPR, perform uninterrupted chest compressions of about 100 per minute until medical professionals arrive. Place your opponent on their back and place your palms, overlapping, in the center of their chest. With straight arms use your upper body weight to press down on the chest about two inches, and continue to repeatedly press down until you have performed 100 compressions. If trained, follow the acronym CAB to perform CPR. Do about 30 chest compressions. Then, go on to check the airway. Tilt the person's head back by using one of your palms to tilt the forehead back while you tilt the chin back with your other hand. Place your ear near their mouth and check to see if you can hear or feel breathing. Monitor this for only five to 10 seconds. If he or she is still not breathing, begin ""breathing"" or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. With the head titled back, place your mouth over theirs, plug their nose with your hand, and give two rescue breaths, lasting each a second long. If they still aren't breathing, continue the cycle of chest compressions, checking the airway, and breathing until paramedics arrive or your opponent has begun breathing normally., Massage the carotid triangle on the neck to manually simulate the carotid sinus or to open up a collapsed artery. You may also try massaging the chest or diaphragm to stimulate breathing.CPR is the preferred technique if your opponent remains unconscious because traditional techniques are considered advanced, but they may be used in special circumstances and with adequate training.

"['avoid being clingy', 'talk to him', 'tell him about yourself', 'be kind to him', 'be yourself', 'remember that he is human']",How to Not Be Annoying to Your Crush," Although you may want his attention, it's important to give him his space. If he feels that you respect him and his personal space, he may be more likely to interact with you. Otherwise, he may view you as a needy person and stay away from you. For instance, if he doesn't respond to your text within five minutes, understand that he has his own life.   If you notice that he replies to you with very few words, don't become upset or demand that he says more. Instead, it may be helpful to ask questions in your texts so that he has something to respond to. Rather than sending him yes-or-no questions, try to come up with ones that may require him to reply with more words (ex: ""What did you think of the soccer game?""). If he still gives you a short reply, you could wait for a short time to indicate that you want him to say a bit more.; , Although you should avoid being overly talkative, initiate conversations with him to show that you're interested in his life. Come up with interesting subjects that engage the both of you. Be sure that you give him a chance to express his opinion. Don't hesitate to ask questions about himself, as most people enjoy talking about themselves. If you don't have time to talk to him, a simple greeting is enough to grab his attention.   If you have trouble selecting conversation topics, think of events that are occurring around you. For instance, if you recently had a biology test, talk to him about it and ask whether he did well or not. However, try to branch out and talk about other subjects rather than only focusing on school. If you notice that he isn't talking much, consider the possibilities. Are you dominating the conversation and not allowing him a chance to speak? Is he not interested in the subject? Or is he just naturally quiet? Do your best to remedy the situation so that he enjoys talking to you.  , Although you shouldn't stay in the spotlight for too long, it's a good idea to share some facts about your life with him so that he can get to know you more. Tell him things about you - such as your hobbies - that will stick in his mind and show that you're a unique girl. You may even discover common interests, which may open the way for more conversations.  , Although you shouldn't overdo it, treat him nicely. For instance, if he doesn't have a lunch, offer to give him some money or share your food with him. If he tells you about something bad that happened to him, sympathize with him and listen to what he has to say. Show that you care about him and his well-being.   Be careful when treating him nicely. If he isn't a good person, he may take advantage of your kindness. If you notice that he is using you, immediately stop and don't allow him to manipulate you. Although you may be attracted to him, it can be dangerous and painful if you let him control you.  , Although you may want to impress him, changing who you are isn't the right choice. You're not only presenting a false image of yourself but also hurting yourself and perhaps even others in the process. By staying true to who you are, you're showing that you are proud of yourself, which may attract his attention. Don't pretend to be someone you aren't.   Avoid changing for him. It may be tempting to mold yourself into his type, but maintaining that facade will be painful and exhausting. Showing how unique you are will attract the right kinds of guys.  , While it may be easy to worship him, allowing your crush to take over your life is a dangerous route. It can be easy to overlook his flaws and focus only on his strengths, which can be harmful. If you feel that you are becoming too obsessed with him, you may want to take a step back and place some space between the two of you. Participate in different activities to get your mind off of him.  ",['kind']

Hyperhidrosis usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face bilaterally (on both sides of the body) and episodes occur at least weekly during waking hours.Some people suffering with hyperhidrosis constantly sweat throughout the day.   People with severe hyperhidrosis can run the risk of dehydration unless they replenish their lost fluids with plenty of water. Approximately 3% of the population experience bouts of hyperhidrosis, particularly adults aged 25 to 65 years.; , Most antiperspirants found in grocery stores and pharmacies contain aluminum-based compounds that can temporarily block the pores that release sweat.Consequently, the sweat doesn't reach the surface of the skin and eventually gets reabsorbed by the body. As such, apply liberal amount of antiperspirants under your arms, as well as onto the palms of your hands and soles of your feet. It may feel a little strange, but likely better than the clamminess that's commonly associated with hyperhidrosis.   Over-the-counter antiperspirants are usually best for cases of minor hyperhidrosis only. If you're applying antiperspirant to your hands, you may want to use unscented varieties, especially if you anticipate greeting people and shaking hands with them.  , Choose clothing wisely if you have hyperhidrosis. You should always wear clothes that are breathable and made from natural fabrics, such as cotton, light wool and silk.When you exercise, consider wearing more advanced fabrics that are designed to wick moisture away from your skin. Cotton socks are best for sweaty feet, although you still might have to change them multiple times per day. Shoes made from natural materials (especially leather and suede) can help prevent excessive sweating by allowing your feet to breathe.   Rotate the shoes you wear because they may not completely dry overnight. If you must wear damp shoes, use a hair dryer to get them as dry as possible. Using talcum powder in your shoes might help absorb moisture and prevent them from being constantly damp. Chronic dampness increases the risk of mold growth.  , The more you sweat, the more salts, toxins and sugars get deposited on your skin, which attracts bacteria. The compounds in sweat combined with the waste material from the proliferating bacteria greatly contribute to foul body odor. As such, people with hyperhidrosis need to bathe more often (at least daily if not twice daily) to help keep the number of bacteria in check and to keep from becoming too malodorous.Regular soap is fine for combating bacteria, but buy brands that have natural moisturizers (aloe, almond extract) in them so your skin doesn't get too dry and flaky. After taking a shower or bath, make sure to dry yourself thoroughly, especially between your toes and under your arms.   People who sweat profusely on a regular basis are more prone to bacterial skin infections, particularly from ingrown toenails and minor abrasions. Excessive loss of electrolytes is another issue for people with moderate-to-severe hyperhidrosis because sweat contains salt. Loss of electrolytes often leads to muscle cramping.  , There are a variety of herbal preparations that have been used by various cultures over many generations to combat excessive sweating, although none have been thoroughly studied by Western scientists to determine their effectiveness. However, there are many anecdotal reports that applying certain herbs as antiperspirant or consuming them internally can help combat hyperhidrosis. For example, witch hazel extract is strongly astringent, which dries skin and acts as an effective antiperspirant virtually anywhere on the body.The tannic acid in black tea is also very astringent, so washing parts of your body with cold tea may be very helpful to combat sweating.   Other herbs traditionally used to reduce sweating include white vinegar, sage tea, slices of raw potato, tea tree oil, and camphor combined with coconut oil. Most herbal preparations diluted in water are safe and appropriate to use in all areas of the body, although some might sting your eyes, so be cautious when washing your face.  , Stress caused by your job and/or personal relationships can create anxiety and trigger bouts of hyperhidrosis. Consequently, try to deal with the stress in your life by making positive changes and/or train yourself to combat anxious thoughts by being more optimistic and innovative. In other words, try to ""turn lemons into lemonade"" more often. Excessive stress triggers the sympathetic nervous system to release hormones that prepare your body for ""fight or flight"" — and a side effect of that mode is more sweating.Avoid reading about stressful events in the newspaper and watching stressful, scary or thrilling shows on TV. Instead, read more motivational, inspiring and/or comedic material and watch comedies or documentaries. Try natural relaxation techniques such as meditation, tai chi, yoga, breathing exercises and/or biofeedback — all can help reduce the stress that triggers sweating.  , If your efforts at home aren't satisfactory, then your doctor may prescribe an antiperspirant with a higher percentage of aluminum chloride (about 20%), such as Drysol or Xerac Ac. This is the first line of treatment against hyperhidrosis.Prescription antiperspirants are usually applied just before bedtime and left on overnight, then washed off in the morning. It often takes three to five days to see noticeable results.   Aluminum chloride products work best if applied to a dry area and then covered with plastic wrap overnight. Prescription antiperspirants can cause skin and eye irritation, so be careful handling them. If your skin becomes chronically irritated, hydrocortisone cream is usually recommended in combination with the aluminum chloride product.  , The injection of Botulinum Toxin A (Botox, Myobloc) into particularly sweaty areas is another treatment option for hyperhidrosis.Botox also has anticholinergic effects as it decreases the transmission of the nerve impulses to the sweat glands and reduces sweating. Botulinum injections for the underarms to reduce sweating is approved by the FDA. However, several injections are required for significant results, which can relieve symptoms for between three to nine months, but the potential long-term dangers of Botox injections are not well understood.   Keep in mind that this is a second line treatment. Botox injections can be painful and expensive, so it is bets to try first line treatment options first. Just like getting Botox for facial wrinkles, your underarm skin is iced or anesthetized before getting injected. A 2008 study found Botox to be more effective than topical 20% aluminum chloride antiperspirant for the treatment of moderate-to-severe underarm hyperhidrosis., Microwave thermolysis is a procedure that uses microwave energy to destroy the endocrine glands that produce sweat. The FDA approved this treatment for hyperhidrosis in 2011. However, your body will still be able to cool itself down after the procedure because only 2% of your sweat glands are in your armpits.Most insurance companies do not cover microwave thermolysis, so check your insurance before you consider this treatment. The procedure is painless because your doctor will numb your armpits before starting. Multiple sessions are required. Each session lasts about an hour, but most patients report reduced sweating after only two sessions.  , Common systemic agents (taken orally) used to treat hyperhidrosis include anticholinergic medications (propantheline bromide, glycopyrrolate, oxybutynin, benztropine).Anticholinergics are relatively effective because they block the preglandular neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) that triggers sweat secretion. However, the down side is that these medications commonly create numerous side effects such as mydriasis (pupil dilation), blurry vision, dry mouth and eyes, difficulty urinating and constipation.   Anticholinergics used to treat hyperhidrosis are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose and are being used ""off label"", which is legal, but not always considered ideal. Other systemic medications used off label for hyperhidrosis include sedatives and tranquilizers, indomethacin (anti-iflammatory drug) and calcium channel blockers.  , Iontophoresis was introduced over 50 years ago and consists of passing a direct low-level electrical current across the skin of water-soaked hands, feet and armpits in order to reduce sweating.The mechanism of action remains debatable, but it is effective and without any significant side effects. Treatment is usually 2-3 times a week for 20-30 minute sessions, and slowly decreases over time (like once every two months), although the devices are often required to be bought or some hospitals/GPs might loan them out for patients to take home for the sake of convenience. Most hospitals that have a dermatological area have one and the waiting lists are usually quite short. Iontophoresis is not an option for people who have pacemakers or are pregnant. Anticholinergic agents can be mixed in water to soak the skin to make the procedure a little more effective, but it also triggers occasional side effects. Side effects such as irritation are common, and also some patients experience light electric shocks after the treatment.  , A sympathectomy is a surgical procedure to reduce sweating by blocking a group of nerves in your chest. This nerve group sends signals to your brain that cause your body to sweat. In someone with hyperhidrosis, cutting off this signal can put a stop to excessive sweating.Like any surgery there are risks,but new endoscopic techniques have made the surgery safer than it used to be. A sympathectomy should not be your first choice. It is a last resort treatment. If nothing else works for you, then a sympathectomy may be a good option.

Keep a log of the times you feel lightheaded to share with your doctor. Your doctor may order tests or an MRI to pinpoint the cause of your lightheadedness.If your doctor doesn’t find a cause and your lightheadedness continues, your doctor will discuss possible medications you can take or self-care measures you can use to make your symptoms manageable., Depending on the results of your doctor’s visit and possible tests, your doctor will prescribe treatment to manage your lightheadedness. Your doctor may prescribe medications or suggest managing your lightheadedness with self-care.   If your lightheadedness is cause by an inner ear conditions, your doctor may prescribe balance retraining exercises, which is also called vestibular rehabilitation. You may also get a prescription for meclizine (Antivert), diazepam (Valium), or dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) to help immediately alleviate nausea and lightheadedness.If you have Meniere's disease, which causes the sensation of spinning, your doctor may prescribe a diuretic and dietary changes, such as a low-sodium diet, to minimize how much fluid your body is retaining.If you have lightheadedness because of vestibular migraine, your doctor may help you figure out what triggers your attacks, such as diet, stress, sleep and exercise. Your doctor may also prescribe to help prevent attacks or relieve nausea.If you suffer from an anxiety disorders, your doctor may prescribe medications and psychotherapy that may relieve your anxiety and dizziness.If you have anemia, or low iron levels, your doctor may suggest self-care through dietary changes.If you have hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, your doctor may suggest self-care through eating regular, healthy meals and carrying a snack.Heart conditions such as abnormal heart rhythm, or arrhythmia, may decrease your blood volume causing orthostatic hypotension, or low pressure when you stand up from lying or sitting down.Your doctor may suggest the self-care treatment sitting down and allowing your circulation to stabilize when this happens.Some medications, including anti-seizure drugs, sedatives, and tranquilizers can also cause lightheadedness and your doctor may re-evaluation your use of these treatments if they’re causing your lightheadedness., No matter the cause of your lightheadedness, stop what you're doing and rest for a couple of minutes.

This will also help stabilize your blood flow and stop your lightheadedness., Making sure that you are getting enough oxygen can help relieve lightheadedness. Taking deep, steady breaths will help to get your body vital oxygen, but also calm you down.Try breathing to a count to help you focus on stabilizing your oxygen levels and pulse. For example, you can inhale for a count of four and exhale for a count of four. Choose a count that suits you best.Breathing slowly and deeply will help decrease an elevated heart rate, which also can make you feel lightheaded., Both low blood sugar and low iron levels can cause you to feel lightheaded. Making sure that you are eating healthy and regular meals can help you avoid feeling lightheaded.Natural, whole foods including lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, and legumes will help you maintain normal blood sugar throughout the day, making you less likely to have a spell of lightheadedness. If you often suffer from lightheadedness because of low blood sugar, consider carrying a snack like a granola bar or an apple with you to combat any symptoms that might flare up. If you have low iron levels, incorporate more iron-rich foods into your diet to maintain safe levels of iron and help decrease the likelihood of lightheadedness. Examples of iron-rich foods are red and organ meats such as beef and liver, spinach, and dried beans.In some cases, not having enough sodium in your diet can cause lightheadedness. Dissolve a teaspoon of salt into a glass of water and this may help regulate your circulation and relieve your lightheadedness., Consuming enough liquids every day can keep you from feeling lightheaded. In hot weather, staying hydrated will also help you from overheating.You should drink at least 10 glasses of liquid a day to prevent dehydration.

"['be in the present moment', ""meditate when you're a passenger"", 'meditate in your accommodation', 'meditate while walking', 'hiking', 'or touring by foot', 'meditate in nature', 'enjoy your new food experiences in a meditative way', 'listen as meditation', 'visit meditation retreats', 'express gratitude']",How to Meditate While Travelling," The purpose of meditation is to ground you in the moment and to help you become more aware of your surroundings. When travelling, you're already more aware of things around you because they're new. Yet, you can't possibly take in everything and the novelty itself can be a form of minor distress until you feel comfortable with it. Meditation can help you bridge the shock of the new with the comfort of enjoying learning about many new things and meeting new people. Meditation will also help you to be mindful of anything that you need to be paying more attention to during your travels.; , Travelling on a bus, train, boat, or other form of transport can provide you with the opportunity to meditate as the journey meanders on. There are different approaches possible, including:   Shut your eyes and concentrate only on the rhythm of the engine, wheels, tracks, etc. of the transport method. Use this rhythm to aid your meditation, focusing only on the particular rhythm and excluding all else. Count the number of cars you come across which are of a particular/favorite brand. Focus solely on seeing those cars that you have singled out for finding. Or count trees, signs, road markers, farmhouses, etc. Whatever you feel is the right object to follow. Close your eyes and count. Count each breath in and each breath out, from one to ten, then return to one again. If you lose your way or your mind drifts, start again from the beginning as you shouldn't become out of touch with your breath and each count. This is a good way to while away the time of a long journey. Simply relax. If it's a boat or train, and you're able to move around, find a comfortable corner in the sun or somewhere with a pleasant ambiance and simply relax your whole body. Let your thoughts disappear and  , Your accommodation will undoubtedly vary from place to place and you will need to make the most of whatever you get. No matter how spartan, plush, or bizarre your surroundings, you should be able to meditate still. Focus on the moment, switch off all distractions such as the TV and cell phone, and find a comfortable part of your hotel room, dormitory, or other accommodation arrangement to meditate for a quarter hour or so each day.   If you're sharing a room, either select a time of day when it's likely to be quiet or ask the concierge if there is something quiet where you can go to meditate. Many people will be happy to accommodate your wishes.  , ""Walking meditation"" can be a useful method of meditating if you're doing a lot of sightseeing or hiking as part of your travels. Walking meditation is a form of contemplative expression; use the time of walking to double check your posture (especially important if you've been wearing a heavy backpack or lugging bags around). Walking meditation can also be an opportunity to relax from the inner complaints about feeling sore or tired from walking.   Check your posture from head down to your toes. Place one hand on your abdomen, the other on top. Walk with an awareness of each foot lifting up slowly, moving through the air, and taking the heel of one foot barely in front of the toes of the other foot. Keep the head and body trunk still. Keep your eyes looking ahead at the ground stretching out in front of you. Experience the changes occurring, ever so subtly, as you allow each foot to touch the ground, feeling the pressure exerted on the foot with each step taken. Allow the act of walking to be your full focus, rather than being preoccupied with the destination, or where you've been.  , Many travel experiences include getting into natural environments, whether it's a botanical garden, a sanctuary, a nature reserve, or a national park. Wherever there is nature surrounding you, you have an opportunity to meditate while contemplating the beauty of nature about you.   Go out of your way to experience some nature while travelling. A journey to a new place is not complete without seeking out its natural aspects too. Feel the colors, hear the sounds, and enjoy the energy from nature as you're amongst it. Relax and seek to be at one with the nature around you. Pay full attention to the natural elements that are contributing to your sense of well-being during your journey. Meditate on a flower. Flowers can be found anywhere, even in a hotel foyer. To meditate on a flower, look at the flower in great detail, with love. Take in every detail, color, and its totality. Notice any fragrance that it may have, and whether it is attracting other life, such as a bee, to it. Allow your attention on the flower to open up your experience of the wonders of existence.  , When travelling, you'll often come across new foods that you haven't tried before, or variations on foods you are used to. Not only does this offer a wonderful opportunity to open your mind to new experiences, tastes, and sensations, but there is a meditative opportunity here too. Pay attention to each and every ingredient of a dish. Can you name the particular ingredients?   Eat slowly to enjoy the experience of eating – this will aid your digestion and help with peace of mind.   Chew and swallow your food slowly. Before swallowing, make the food almost liquid. Swallow the food mindfully. Experience the different tastes from the food and drink.   Use snacks as an entire meditation experience. For example, take a single raisin, or a slice of an orange, and turn it into an eating meditation. Become totally aware of the entire process of chewing it, feeling it on your teeth, tasting it on your taste buds, and swallowing it.  , When travelling, there are many sounds surrounding you, such as the rhythm of transport explored in an earlier step. Sounds can frustrate you if you're over-tired and anxious but they can also serve as an anchor and ground you if you take them and meditate on them. For example, the sounds of flight announcements, the sound of jet engines, the hubbub of people talking, the music at a cafe, the drone of lawnmowers can all be sounds on which you choose to focus and notice your feelings as they rise and fall. Sounds document the ebb and flow of life, they are neither positive nor negative, and there are empty spaces in between them. Listen attentively and be receptive to how the sounds can provide meditation simply through the act of focused listening.   Listen to a piece of music or a song. With portable music players, using music for meditative practices while you travel is extremely easy and can be done on any part of your journey. Pay attention to each note within the music, or to the instruments used, or to the words.  , It doesn't matter if they are of your own faith or beliefs provided they welcome travelers or visitors with open arms and are happy for you to participate in their meditation practices. Look online for retreats near the locations where you're traveling; most will make it amply clear if they accept transient visitors. Just be sure to conform to their rules and precepts, and to make a donation even if it's not required.  , As you travel, devote a part of your time to expressing your gratitude for your travel experiences.   Be grateful for the people who have made your travelling experience much easier, more engaging, and eye-opening for you. Be grateful for the people who grew, harvested, and prepared the food you're eating as you travel. Be grateful for the expertise of those who have transported you to all the different places you've been visiting. Be grateful for those who have hosted you in accommodation, enabling you to sleep and rejuvenate so far away from home. May all live in peace.

Use the following steps while the person is calm, so that when out of control and having a ""meltdown"" (as it is commonly called), the individual will be able use these techniques to calm himself. Teaching these techniques while the person is upset is much more difficult, though not impossible.   Mirror the person while you do each step. Breathe in through the nose slowly and evenly until the the lungs are at full capacity. When the lungs are completely full, the stomach pushes out, so calling each breath a “belly breath” provides a concrete image that helps in visualizing the proper technique. Hold the breath for a slow count of five. Breathe out through the mouth, releasing the air slowly and evenly. Repeat five times: Five ""belly breaths"" held for a count of five make one group (or set).; , Do it once in the morning and once in the evening. Practice until the person can do the breathing independently.  , It will add to the calming influence of the breathing itself.  , Once learned, it can be called upon as a sensory image when the person does become upset or out of control.  ,   Many times it is water, either waves or a gurgling brook. Focus on determining the particular color of light that is calming. It is normally some uniform, pastel color.  , It should consist of short lines which describe the process of walking towards the calming sound (perhaps a brook or ocean) and going towards the calming light.   Describe how, as the person gets closer, the place becomes safer and safer, how the warm light of a certain color is welcoming, protecting, calming.  , This will enhance their ability to imagine the situation you're describing. However, don't force them into situations they're uncomfortable with.  , This might be helpful during the breathing and a few minutes afterwards.  , Continue to talk about safety and light, even after the breathing exercises have concluded. Continue until the person has visibly calmed.  , Continue the script: Walk away from the calming force (water, for example), but remind the person that the light is now carried within, calm begetting calm. Return to the beginning of the script, carefully reversing the dialogue.  , Ask them if they feel calmer, or if they want to continue with imagery and breathing techniques.  , Use this technique, once learned, along with deep breathing, to bring calm in ""meltdown"" situations.  , Talk the person through this process prior to attempting any hugs. If trust is an issue, or if the child is young, demonstrate the process with another person. This will ease the child into understanding and offer comfort.  , Explain that this type of hugging is very, very relaxing. However, avoid making them feel they have to do anything. No forced touch is ever preferable.  , You can do ""practice hugs"" during calm times, and calming hugs during distressing times. Use this process:   Approach person from the back. Hold your upper arms out straight and your forearms pointing at the sky (up). Talk as you go through the entire experience so there are no surprises and everything is comfortable. Ask the person to put their arms at their sides. Using your forearms, provide a moderate amount of pressure on the person's upper arms near the torso. Squeeze moderately for the count of ten, then release. Repeat this five times.  , If yes, repeat again in sequences of five.   Stop after the third set, if the person has asked for that many.  , If they feel calmer or liked the hug, they may want more. If not, they may want to try something else.  , Use this and any of the other calming techniques as necessary during meltdowns to help the person calm down. But continue practicing and doing it during calm times, too - you don't want hugging to become associated only with meltdowns or distress.

Familiarizing yourself with aging may help to dispel some of your fears about aging, and talking to people who are older than you is a good way to do this. Spend some time talking with an elderly relative or friend once per week. Ask about his or her experiences and listen to what he or she has to share.By spending time with someone who is older than you, you may start to find it easier to imagine an older version of yourself. Spending time with someone who is older than you may also start to demystify the aging process a bit and make it easier to accept.  , Staying physically active can make your body and mind feel better and can help promote a longer, healthier life. Staying active means you will be more able to keep doing things that make you happy.If you aren't physically active now, start small and work your way up. Start with easily achievable goals. Park farther away from the store and walk a little. Take the stairs instead of the elevator if you're only going up a couple of floors. Then, slowly start building more exercise into your routine. Stretching and yoga can help you stay flexible and maintain range of motion. This can help you maintain your ability to do other things you enjoy., As you get older, eating the right foods becomes increasingly important in ensuring the good health you need to retain a satisfying quality of life. Pay close attention to what you eat. Specifically:Make sure you get enough protein to help keep your muscles strong. Limit fat intake, and eat healthy fats like those found in fish and avocado. Drink plenty of water. Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Consider dietary supplements. Talk to your doctor or a dietician about which one(s) might be most beneficial for you.  , Everyone knows cigarettes are bad for your health. They are bad for your skin and lungs and can cause cancer. Cigarettes have also been linked to faster mental decline in elderly people.If you already smoke, try to quit. Even if you have smoked for years, quitting may have a positive effect. If you don't smoke, don't start.  , Daily meditation can help you deal with physical discomfort that might come with aging, and can also help with the anxiety and depression you might experience if you are struggling to accept aging.Try to clear your mind of all thoughts and focus on your breathing for several minutes. If thoughts begin to creep in, let them pass through your mind and return your focus to your breathing.  , To make sure your health stays good, see your doctor regularly. Catching problems early can help you deal with them before they become serious.   Be your own advocate and ask good questions when you go see the doctor. Bring your health history, and be assertive about asking questions about any concerns you may have.If this stressful for you, remember that it's okay to bring a friend of loved one with you.

Then label every room to be a certain place e.g. Marsh, Town, dark forest, lake, mountains. You can use the same world that you would find in adventure quest worlds. You can do the same with RuneScape or wow if you want, just pick any other game that has an interesting world in it. If your house isn't big enough for all of the world, you can make rooms to be two different places that change when you want them to.  , You will need another sheet of paper for this. Think of a name and write it at the top of the sheet of paper. Then draw out a big portrait rectangular box on the left hand side of he sheet of paper this will be where you draw your character, or if you don't like drawing it will be where you write what you have on you eg sword, armor etc. There are four classes to choose from. Mage, warrior, healer, and rouge. Each have there own special abilities that you come up with later. Eg a wizard has spells, a warrior has special heavy blows etc. You then must draw out a bar on the right side of the paper, make sure you do all of this in pencil. The bar will be how much exp you have. You gain more from battling monster and doing quests. When your bar becomes full you level up learning a new move. We will come on to how to fill in this later. Also do a bar for your health and a bar for your mana under the exp bar. Draw another box for your items and then your character sheet will be finished.  , In your world you will fight monsters and do quests to see what level you can get to. You will decide on what your character does in this world. In the town you start in, there will be an imaginary person to set you on your quest. The best kind of quest involves fighting creatures, getting around obstacles you have set up and a bit of finding objects. It doesn't have to conform to any specific rule (other than the rules of your role playing game and/or the world in which you are playing) but start simple and think up your own quests. The first step is to go to the place where the task is to be done and decide on the monster you will fight. See the next step in learning how to fight.  , First of all you will need some dice, e.g. use the 12 sided dice on your iPod touch role playing game dice application, but 6 sided dice will do fine, you will just have to use double the amount of dice. The weapon you start with depends on your class, a healer or a Mage will have a basic staff, a warrior will have a basic sword, and a rogue will have a basic dagger, all of these weapons do 5 dice damage (if you are using 6 sided dice this will be 10 dice damage). The monster you are fighting will have 200-300 health and you will have 500 health to start with but this can go up when you level up. You roll first, roll the dice and see how much damage you inflict. You minus that off his health. He now has 50 health left etc. He then fights you he has 3 dice damage. (again double this if you are using 6 sided dice.) Minus his damage off your health bar. When ever yours or the monsters health bar goes to zero you or the monster dies. If you die you can ever go back to your hometown now, or you can wait 10 minutes and retire to the same place. Now we know to battle we can continue with our quest.  , What you do for this is search your house for a certain item eg something purple, something with buttons, something round, something that has a picture of a face on it, etc. Because we need to find five ancient scrolls, we need to defeat 5 monsters and find find 5 items in the same category. However, you can't just stay in the same place in the room all the time you must explore after every 3 kills. You do this by setting a challenge, something like jumping from one sofa to the other, or climbing along your garden fence.Once you are at the next part you can kill the remaining monsters you need to kill. Once you have done this you have completed the quest.  , First of all let's but a new weapon, you can start with 10,000 gold which can buys you a... Spider sword, Warlocks fire/ice staff, a dragon tooth dagger or a big bad blade of destruction. Choose one to buy, these weapons are better than your old one so add one dice to how many you roll in battle. Draw this new sword on your character on the drawing. Swords that cost more do more damage, so save up your gold if you want to kill hard monsters. Now to know how to fill in your exp bar as you battle creatures you get experience, you get 50 exp every time you kill a creature and you get 300 exp every time you kill a boss (a very hard creature.) for level one you have to get 500 exp to level up, so shade in 50'exp into the bar when the whole bar is shades you level up and learn a new move 1/5. You decide what this move is and what it does, whether it let's you attack twice in a row or whether it can heal 30 of your health. You must wait 3 turns before you use the same move again and you must lower your mana bar by a certain amount when you use the move.  , This is pretty much all you need to know to have fun playing your rpg.

You wear the belt around your waist with your dog’s leash attached to the belt. In general the process for walking your dog is the same.There are two great benefits for using a hands-free leash. One is the obvious, you’re hands are free. This makes it easier to reward your dog for good behaviour, and swing your arms if you’re walking quickly or running. Two is that the main point of resistance to your dog is the middle of your body, right near your centre of gravity. This makes you significantly more stable than holding the leash in your hands.  , When you go to the pet store to buy a leash, you’ll notice they come in every material, length and colour you can imagine. The colour you choose is completely up to you! The length should be based on the type of activity you’ll be performing with your dog. And the material should be based on personal comfort and expense.If you’re taking your dog for a loose leash walk, a leash that has the ability to uncoil and recoil is very useful. Instead of folding pieces of the leash in your hands, you can simply click a button and allow your dog to uncoil the rope. These leashes, however, are not designed for heel walks, or walks where there are a lot of obstacles for a rope to get caught on (including people and other dogs). Leashes can be made of metal chains, leather or nylon. Here are some things you may want to consider when choose the material of a leash:  Metal - looks cool, but is heavy. Can prevent a dog from attempting to bite the leash. Leather - expensive, but easy to hold and use. The leather may not be as flexible in cold weather. Nylon - the least expensive, and has the most variety. Stands up after constant exposure to different weather conditions. But can be hard on the hands.    , Many dog owners enjoy bringing their dogs when going for a run, a bike ride, or rollerblading. This offers great exercise to both you and your dog, and should hopefully tire your dog out faster!Remember to control your dog throughout the run. Since it is a run, don’t allow your dog to stop unless you do. You both should be able to maintain the same, steady pace.  , Your dog should have more slack on the leash while walking, than while standing still. They should always feel comfortable in their leash and collar to avoid injury and misbehaviour. When walking, your dog should be immediately to your side (which side will depend on what’s more comfortable to you). Your dog should not walk behind or in front of you.If you allow your dog to walk behind you on a leash, there’s a great chance you’ll pull too hard on the leash in order to force the dog to keep up with you.  , Your right hand should be holding the end of the leash, with your thumb through the loop and excess leash folded in your hand. Your left hand should be holding another section of the leash, closer to your dog. Your left hand should be down near your left thigh. When it’s time to stop, simply pull backwards with your left hand.There should be some slack in the leash between your two hands AND between your left hand and your dog. When you’re ready to move again, start walking forward. Your left arm will naturally pull on the leash and signal your dog it’s time to go. Don’t yank on the leash.  , One of the worst situations most owners encounter when taking their dog for a walk is what happens when another person or another dog walk by. You dog may walk perfectly if there’s no one around, but the moment there’s a distraction, your dog may completely forget everything they've learned. That’s why it’s important to train your dog to ignore distractions while on a walk.When practicing, use a friend or family member as the distraction, rather than practicing on unsuspecting strangers. While learning to ignore distractions, you may find the use of a head halter beneficial. A head halter has a nylon strap that goes around your dog’s snout. And the leash connects to the halter under your dog’s chin. Both of these added features provide you with more control of what your dog is looking at. Teaching your dog to ignore a distraction has a lot to do with making your dog pay attention to you, and only you.There are several methods you can teach your dog:Avoidance - Sometimes the problem isn’t your dog, but maybe the dog coming in the opposite direction. Instead of walking past the oncoming dog, train your dog to reverse directions. The L Pattern - The L pattern method can be used to position your dog off to the side of the path you’re on, facing away from the path. If you see something distracting coming towards you, turn your dog to the left or right. Walk your dog just off the path and use the sit command. Keep your dog sitting there - looking at you - until the distraction has gone by. Repeated Sits - When you see a distraction coming towards, regardless of whether they’ll pass on your left or right side, repeated sit trains your dog to sit and face you. Your dog remains sitting until the distraction has passed. Depending on the situation, you can train your dog to sit facing away from the oncoming distraction, or facing the distraction with their head tilted away, looking at you. Speed Up - Most methods require that you stop your dog while the distraction is near, and wait to resume your walk after the distraction has passed. An alternative is to simply pick up the pace when the distraction approaches, and slow down again after the distraction passes.

You can buy the comb from your local pharmacy, medical supply store, grocery store or large retailer.Read the label to make sure that you have a lice comb. This type of comb will have tooth spacing of 0.2-0.3mm in order to capture the smallest lice. It may also be black to help you more effectively identify individual louse. Avoid getting a nit comb, because they often cannot detect individual louse or lice as well as lice combs.Remember that regular combs are also not suitable for detecting lice. They don’t effectively detect lice and might even reintroduce lice back into your hair.; , Use a regular comb to straighten and detangle your hair. This prepares your hair for using the lice comb. In addition, it may also help you more effectively detect lice.Consider wrapping a towel around your shoulders to catch falling hair that may have lice. This may keep lice from transferring to other people or areas of your home. Throw away the comb after using it to prevent re-infestation or transmission to another person. Wash and dry the towel by itself on the hottest settings possible to prevent transmission or re-infestation., Systematically combing through all of your hair minimizes the risk of not seeing lice. Pulling your hair into individual sections can ensure that you comb your entire head.   Use clips or hair bands to create individual sections. Remove the clips or bands before you comb a new section. Make sure to throw away any hair bands and sterilize clips after use to prevent re-infestation or transmission to others.  , Once a regular comb moves easily through the hair, run the lice detection comb through your hair. Make sure to comb each individual section so that you don’t miss any lice.Comb each section of hair from the scalp to the end three to four times. Repeated combing can ensure you effectively detect any lice in your hair. Be aware that lice will quickly move away from any disturbance in dry hair. Wet lice remain still, which is why wet combing may be more effective at detecting lice., As you comb each section, make sure to examine the comb for individual louse with each pass.Lice may look like dandruff, hair product residue, other small insects, or beads of dead hair tissue.Examine hair under a bright light or with a magnifying glass to best see any lice. Trap lice that you find between your thumb and the comb. This prevents the louse from getting free or static electricity from your hair from repelling it. Put the louse on a piece of tape and then throw it away to prevent transferring lice to another person.  , If you find a live louse, you can be confident that an active infestation is present. However, if you are unsure about something you’ve found, attach it to a piece of tape, put it in a Ziploc bag, and take it to a pharmacist, doctor, or other healthcare professional to confirm a case of lice.Take steps to treat the lice infestation as soon as you confirmation an active case.  , You can use an different medications to treat a lice infestation. Start with over-the-counter remedies and switch to a prescription medication if your lice don’t respond to initial treatment. Wash your hair with shampoo and no conditioner before applying the medication. Rinsing hair with vinegar before application can also help. Follow the packaging instructions for any lice treatment you use. Read labels for products containing the following medications:   Permethrin, in products such as Nix Pyrethrin with additives, in products such as Rid and A-200 Lice Killing Benzyl alcohol, in prescription products such as Ulesfia Malathion, in prescription products such as Ovide, Comb the length of wet hair with a fine-toothed comb, lice comb, or nit comb if you want to avoid chemical treatments. This can remove some lice and nits if repeated over several weeks.Wet hair with water and apply hair conditioner for easier combing. Section off the hair and run the comb over the length of each section at least twice. Wipe the comb clean with a tissue and run it through hot water after you’ve combed each section.Repeat wet-combing every three to four days for several weeks or until you don’t see any lice.  , Natural plants oils may kill lice and soothe any itching you experience. Be aware that essential oils are not approved by the Federal Drug Administration to treat lice and may not meet safety or efficacy standards.Choose an essential oil sold at a health food store, pharmacy, or even your grocery store. Some essential oils that can kill lice are tea tree oil, anise oil, ylang ylang. Other options include neroli, ginger, jasmine, and lavender.Mix about 50 drops of your oil with 4 tablespoons vegetable oil. Apply the oil mixture to your entire head and cover with a plastic shower cap. After this, wrap your head with a towel for an hour before shampooing to remove lice., Different household products, such as mayonnaise, can kill lice by depriving them of air.Coating your hair with any of these products and leaving them on overnight may kill lice.Use mayonnaise, butter, petroleum jelly, or olive oil to smother lice. Make sure to coat your entire head with your chosen product. Cover your head with a shower cap and leave it on overnight. In the morning, remove the product with baby oil. Then shampoo and thoroughly rinse your hair.Repeat the process until you can’t find any lice.  , Never treat lice with products that are flammable. Some people may recommend covering your hair in kerosene or gasoline, but these can seriously harm your health and may catch on fire if exposed to open flames., Although lice don’t generally live longer than one day off of the scalp, it’s advisable to clean household items. Wash and clean any personal items used within the past two days to minimize the risk of transmission to others.Wash fabrics including bedding, towels, clothing, and stuffed animals in hot and soapy water. Set your washer to at least 130 degrees Fahrenheit (or 54.4 degrees Celsius). Wash personal care items like brushes and combs in hot, soapy water. Soak the item for 5-10 minutes. Then dry the item thoroughly with a tissue or paper towel. Seal non-washable items in a plastic bag for two weeks. This can deprive the lice of air and kill them. Vacuum floors and upholstered furniture. Throw away the vacuum bag or clean the filter when you are finished to prevent re-infestation.

"['obtain a field box or palette', 'purchase a good quality brush', 'purchase water soluble graphite pencils', 'buy some sketchbooks', 'choose good watercolor paper', 'assemble together various miscellaneous items', 'watercolor easel', 'folding table or drawing board']",How to Put Together Equipment for Watercolour Painting," To begin with, you can use a portable lightweight field box. It should be small and sturdy; easy to travel around with. You buy it empty and fill it up with your own choice of colours. It makes a good investment and if you change your mind about the colours that you have bought, it is easy enough to change them.   Alternately, watch for artist grade field box sets on clearance or deep discount sales. If the color range has two yellows, two reds, two blues, a gold color like yellow ochre, a reddish brown and a dark brown then the set will give you the basic colors you need. One or two greens in it may be useful. White is ""body color"" that may be useful for adding light details on dark areas. If you want to change the colors later, ""half pans"" of pan watercolor are all the same size so you can pull out a color you don't use much and replace it with a new one you've learned to love. Sometimes a set with a good field box is cost effective even if it's more than getting the same colors in a simple box if it's well designed and has extra features like a water bottle, snap in travel brush, folding palette sections. Watch for those on sale and if you're not fond of the paints, feel free to swap in half pans of good paint in other brands. ""Full pans"" are larger and take the space of two half pans in a watercolor box. You can also refill empty half pans from tubes of watercolor paint. If you change the color or brand, be sure to rinse out the remnants of the old paint before adding more. Fill it, let it dry and see the surface sink. Then add more till it's filled up by pouring. If it's the same brand you can add more before it's completely empty. If you live in a very hot and dry climate, the best option would be to purchase tube colour paints. Or if you're fond of using paint strong, direct from the tube. Some painters prefer using tube paints for their consistency.  Use tube watercolour paints on a plastic, lightweight palette; it's easy to hold and not too heavy. These palettes are also good if you prefer bringing more colors out into the field, they have many small slants to hold paint and large mixing areas in the middle once open.   At home a large palette with a cover may be convenient. Porcelain palettes are expensive in large sizes but also come in smaller forms like the traditional seven well ""flower palette."" Porcelain has the advantage that it never stains, weighs more and is less likely to get knocked off the table. Plastic is lightweight. Covered palettes may let you keep paint moist rather than letting it dry out completely, though most watercolors will reactivate if you put water on the dried blob and let it soak for an hour. The bigger boxes are more suitable for indoors, as they are too bulky to cart around with you on field trips. This depends on your transportation, your setup and the weight of the box. Judge how compact the box is and its weight when full against how far you'll walk carrying it before you settle down to paint. A tin with 48 half pans might be quite small compared to a large metal palette with forty or more slants in it.; , You need one good brush; spend a bit of money on getting good quality. Buy a few more if you can afford it but you don't need a huge selection of brushes. If you can afford it, Kolinsky sable brushes are lifetime brushes when properly cared for. If not, consider looking for top quality synthetic or synthetic/sable blends. You may replace good synthetics more often but they can be just as good for a year or two.   For your brush, look for one that has a wide ""belly"", so that it will hold and carry plenty of colour and that also comes to a fine point. You can make a handy holder for your brushes out of a bamboo mat. This allows you to roll up the brushes and tie them together for ease of carrying.  , These are very useful for a watercolor artist.   Ensure that you also get a propelling pencil, one that has a reasonably soft lead.  , You can never have too many sketchbooks, in different shapes and sizes.   But whatever the size, the best type is spiral bound, as these are easier to use outdoors. You can open them out flat and they come in different sizes and different qualities of paper; heavier paper will take colour well, so that you are able to experiment with your paints. Look for ""multi media"" journals that have sizing on the pages to accept water. They allow more big washes and more freedom in your watercolor sketching than drawing paper.  , Watercolor paper comes in sheets, pads or blocks. Each of these forms have different advantages. 100% rag watercolor paper is best, although some good mixed papers can also be effective. Get the best paper that you can afford because good paper will respond better to your early efforts. Many beginners get discouraged when cheap materials don't give good results.   Full sheets can be cut to half sheet or quarter sheet size for large finished paintings, suitable for your portfolio or framing and placing in galleries. They allow you to work large and are sometimes less expensive, though buying by mail order or online you may need to buy a minimum number of five or ten sheets. The disadvantage of loose sheets is that they need to be ""stretched"" - soaked in water, then taped or stapled to dry out on a drawing board that's wood or Gatorboard. This is a lot of physical work for a beginner but useful to know. Stretching watercolor paper also removes some of the sizing and makes it more absorbent. You should also get some watercolour paper in pad form, spiral bound with loose sheets which you can remove once you've done your work. This is handy and convenient but presents a problem you might notice in some sketch books too. Large wash areas and using a lot of water on it may make it ""Cockle"" and bubble up irregularly. Sometimes it won't even dry flat. One way to help reduce this problem is to sketch out a picture area smaller than the size of the pad by an inch or two on all sides, so there's dry paper around the wet area to help flatten it. Another is to weight down the edges of the paper while it's drying by stacking books on it. Watercolor blocks are extremely convenient, especially for working outdoors. They're bound like a pad on all four sides with a little inch on one side left unbound. With all four edges gummed down tight, they may bubble up but will dry completely flat. Look at the weight of the paper. It will say 90 pound, 140 pound, 300 pound or even 400 pound. This is the weight of a stack of 500 sheets of a certain really big size, not how much your pad weighs! 90lb paper is very light, common in student papers and multi media sketchbooks. It's not suited to very heavy washes unless you leave plenty of space to the edges and you may have to flatten it afterward but it's fine for watercolor sketching. 140lb watercolor paper is a good standard weight - quite thick, heavier than cardstock and will usually flatten out again even if it cockles. 300lb paper and heavier is almost like cardboard and has a different feel, it's useful for some types of paintings because it can be very absorbent and you almost don't need a backing board for it. Choose the surface of your watercolor paper. Hot Press is very smooth, like computer paper. It's good for illustrations and styles where you may use fine line pen drawing with watercolor effects. It's hard to get broken color or dry brush effects on Hot Press. Cold Press is standard and it's what most inexpensive pads are. It has a medium texture that gives some broken color and texture interest but the peaks and valleys aren't so large that you can't work small. Rough watercolor paper has very large texture patches, big dips and peaks in the surface. It's good for working large, creating texture effects and doing various other special effects techniques. Each of these textures has its own best techniques and its own look when painted, so test them and discover what suits your style - or whether you like choosing the paper to fit a specific painting. Watercolor boards are another possible surface. They're either paper bonded to an archival board or a special water-absorbent gesso formula applied to MDF or archival boards. They have the advantage they don't need stretching and will not cockle at all. Watercolor ground can be applied to different surfaces to create a surface you can use watercolors on. This can be useful if you want to put a painting on the cover of your hardcover sketchbook or something.  , There is no need to spend a fortune on these extra items. Keep it simple:   a bottle of water; and a collapsible pot for outdoors. Use two pots of water - one clean for adding water to washes and wetting your brush, one dirty for cleaning brushes. Some artists use three so that as the clean one gets dirty there's a second clean one to rely on. At home these water pots can just be jelly or peanut butter jars, cups, short fat drinking glasses, anything handy. Some artists find some of their favorite water containers at yard sales! Indoors, you may find a brush washer system useful. It's a plastic square or rectangular water bucket with two or three compartments. One will have angled notches where you can rest your brush with the hairs under the water but not actually leaning on the hairs, the other side has ridges to scrub your brush against to clean off thick paint. These are useful for watercolor and acrylics, for oil paints the brush washer systems are different. It's similar to the two jar system but has some perks to make brush washing easier. Set out a mixing dish or palette. The plastic palettes for use with tube paints have mixing areas and so do field boxes. At home though, you can supplement these or just use a cheap ceramic or glass plate. Plastic plates can also work but these may become stained a lot easier than ceramic, glass or Corelle. Extra cups for mixing large washes like sky color are useful. Choose a clear cup or one with a white interior so you can accurately judge the strength of the wash. For pouring effects you may need several of these, yard sales are a good choice.  , Each has its advantages. A watercolor easel is designed so that it can tilt completely flat or at any angle - this allows an experienced painter to let paint deliberately run, or colors poured into earlier washes to move in the direction you want. A table is just convenient. Outdoors, field easels are usually lightweight and can double for holding other types of painting equipment outdoors. Indoors, a multifunctional easel that can lay flat will serve for watercolors as well as oils, acrylics and pastels. Or just work on a table indoors. If you use a drawing board with stretched paper, you can put it at a slant to let water run by stacking books under the high end and prop something heavy in front of it so it won't slide off. Watercolor easels work very well with watercolor blocks. The lightweight outdoor ones are cheaper, so the budget minded could just use the outdoor easel at home and tuck it away in the closet when you're done.

"['learn about the different types of herb poultices', 'choose the right variety of herb for your ailment', 'try mint for congestion', 'use dandelion and yellow dock for skin problems', 'treat inflammation and discomfort with goldenseal or slippery elm', 'try onion for ear or sinus pain']",How to Create a Poultice1," There are many different herbs that can be used in a poultice, but they are often divided into three categories. A poultice may be one of the following types:Astringent. Astringent poultices cause your skin to contract, which can be helpful if you need to remove splinters or fragments of foreign objects. Astringent poultices may also be helpful in to drawing out an infection. Astringent herbs include witch hazel, oak bark, yarrow, and flax. These herbs can be used fresh or dried. Activated charcoal, baking soda, and bentonite clay may be used as well.  Heating. A heating poultice is used to increase circulation to an area, thus increasing the warmth of the area. This type of poultice can relax muscles, relieve congestion in the lungs and sinuses, and help relieve sprains and strains. Mustard and onions are most commonly used in a heating poultice.  Vulnerary. In herbal medicine, a vulnerary is an herb that promotes wound healing. They are usually a bit gooey because they contain mucilaginous and oily material in order to soothe and protect the wound. Fresh herbs are best as vulneraries, but powdered or dried herbs can be used as well. The most commonly used vulnerary herbs are comfrey, marshmallow, flax, slippery elm, okra, and plantain.; , Different herbs can be included in a poultice to address the symptoms you're attempting to treat. The medicinal properties of different herbs vary, so it's helpful to invest in a handbook or field guide about local flora so that you can get a better sense of what's available and how it can be used.Most herbal remedies are unverified and based mostly on historical anecdotes and folk stories. That doesn't mean that they don't work, only that they have not yet been medically confirmed and should be used in conjunction with traditional medicine.  , One of the most commonly grown and used herbs for use in poultices is mint, which is especially useful in treating congestion and other respiratory issues. Fresh mint makes an effective and pleasant-smelling poultice on the chest to help with upper-respiratory issues or congestion. Peppermint, wintergreen, and other common mints are all effective when used this way.   Herbs that have a similar effect and could be used to replace mint include lavender, lemon balm, calendula, and licorice root.  , Skin dryness or oiliness are commonly treated with a combination of these three herbs. Containing similar fatty acids and phytonutrients, these herbs can be somewhat effective at helping to clear up skin condition, along with regular washing with soap and warm water.Use a poultice of these fresh herbs as a home remedy for acne, eczema, psoriasis, and some mild rashes.  , General pain or rheumatic discomfort may be treated with a poultice of goldenseal and slippery elm. Other herbs used for similar afflictions include elderberry, fenugreek, flaxseed, slippery elm, and lobelia.   Slippery elm in particular is valuable in treating inflammation, displaying protective, emollient, expectorant, diuretic, and nutritive properties in healing. Slippery elm contains a significant amount of nutrition, comparable to oatmeal.In the American South, a poultice made from goldenseal combined with sage was once commonly used to treat breasts that were sore from lactation., While it may not provide the best-smelling poultice, onion is a commonly used treatment for ear or other sinus related pain, as well as foot odor. In either fresh or dried form, onion can make an effective poultice for its astringency and potency. In Ayurvedic medicine, onion poultices are also commonly used on the chest to address chest pains, congestion, and other breathing-related ailments.","['ear', 'herb', 'yellow dock', 'use dandelion', 'different types', 'mint', 'right variety', 'herb poultices', 'skin problems', 'slippery elm', 'inflammation', 'discomfort', 'sinus pain', 'goldenseal', 'ailment', 'onion', 'congestion']"
"['bring stationery and writing supplies', 'pack study aids', 'bring electronics', 'obtain a list of required supplies for your major', 'check for any special clothing requirements']",How to Fill Your Dorm Room With What You Need1," There are myriad school supplies you could need for your classes, especially your freshman year, since you will likely be taking a variety of general courses. Make sure to bring whatever you might need to be successful.   Generally, you’ll at least want to make sure you bring a planner, calculator, binders, notebooks, folders, flash drive, and lots of pens and highlighters.; , One of your goals in college is most likely to perform well in your classes. To do this, bring study aids that will help you focus. While these can be different for every person, there are a few general aids that will help you be successful.   Laptop “feet” raise the bottom of your laptop so that it is in a more comfortable position to work. An extension cord will give you the freedom to work anywhere in your room that you feel comfortable. Just in case your roommate is not on your schedule, it is a good idea to bring a small reading light so you can continue studying while they are sleeping., Bringing the right electronics is also important. While you may have any number of small electronic gadgets, in general, you’ll want to make sure you have the following:   Laptop computer. When searching for a laptop, make sure it has all the capabilities you’ll need to complete your work, including the right operating system, enough storage, and the appropriate inputs.  For example, if you’re a business student, having Microsoft Office will be essential. It is also important to keep size in mind. If you plan to leave it in your room, a larger laptop would be fine. However, if you plan to take it to the library or class on a regular basis, consider something small and compact.   Portable speakers are another common electronic college students should have. This will allow you to play music or re-play a lecture. Remember to bring headphones too so you can do this without disturbing your roommate. Make sure you bring your cell phone as well. You’ll need to keep in touch with friends, family, and your classmates. Also bring extension cords, surge protectors, and 3-2 prong adapters. This will give you the versatility to work from wherever you’re most comfortable. Check with your college to figure out if your room is equipped with wireless internet and if there are on-campus printers you can use. If not, be sure to bring an Ethernet cable and a printer., You should be able to find a list of any special requirements for your major on your university’s website. If not, try contacting your advisor to find out any special items you might need.   For example, those studying Fine Arts will likely need a case for art supplies and their own sketch pads while Journalism majors might need a voice recorder or AP Styleguide. In addition, review your class list and course descriptions to see if you need any special materials, like a certain software program or specialized calculator., Just like different majors may require specific supplies, they may also require specific types of clothing. Again, check your school’s website or ask an advisor to see what clothing requirements your major has.   For instance, students in the science department may be required to wear close-toed shoes on lab days and business students may need a nice suit for presentations.

Many popular concerts may sell out before you get a chance to buy your tickets.   Don't assume it is sold out until you are told so by the venue Talk to people with similar music interests as you. They are likely to know about upcoming shows. Venues often release ""hold"" tickets a day or two before the show. These are tickets the band or promoter has ""held back"" and must be offered for sale if not used. Keep checking back. Bands that are growing in popularity may still be playing smaller venues. Although this is a great time to see them you should plan on getting your tickets early as possible.  , This will increase your safety and make for an altogether more enjoyable experience.   Start asking around when you hear about the show. Coordinate who will buy the tickets since buying them individually will mean you sit apart. (Unless it is a general admission show.) Keep in contact with your friends after you've decided to go. Make sure no one changes their minds or makes other plans and you buy a ticket for them.  , Either go through the venue website, the band website, an authorized ticket website or authorized ticket site, such as the box office. Compare prices between websites to confirm you are getting your tickets at a reasonable price.   Booking online or in person will offer you the same chance for good tickets. Spending the night outside the venue no longer offers the opportunities for good seats, unless general admission for this venue means standing room close to the stage. In this case, the earlier you get to the venue the higher the likelihood that you will be front and center. Find out the date and time tickets go on sale and try to book at that time. Online sites may offer bad seats for your first search. Unless the show is a guaranteed sell out you can usually refresh the search a few times and find better tickets. If your under 18, have a parent or adult guardian purchase the tickets for you, this doesn't have to mean they spend their money, you can pay them back. Buying smaller numbers of tickets will usually result in better seats. Trying to buy 10 tickets at once will probably have nosebleed seats. Purchases online require a credit card. Box office purchases can usually use cash or credit.  ,   You can avoid some fees by getting an e-ticket that you can print. These are easy to duplicate and since you don't know if it's valid until it is scanned people may shy away from buying your ticket should you need to sell. Most venues offer ""Will Call"" service. This is when you buy your ticket and have it waiting for you at the venue for pick up.  Will Call will require you show a driver's license and the credit card used to buy the tickets. Most require the names match on the credit card, the driver's license and the name the tickets are being held. You should avoid waiting until the day of the show to pick up your will call tickets. Lines will be long and you won't have time to correct a mistake (such as your tickets not being there but your card was charged). Picking up your tickets from Will Call ahead of time also gives you an option should an emergency happen and you must sell your tickets on short notice. Since the buyer can't pick up your tickets from will call. The Will Call window is usually open during the box office's regular business hours and extended hours the day of the show. Smaller venues may have later hours and not offer Will Call service. Call and ask before you assume.    ,, Most concerts are outside and it won't be fun if you don't come prepared and it is raining while you didn't bring a raincoat. Listen to the radio, watch the weather forecast on TV or even check the internet.  , Having an early night means that you won't look awful and that means you will be able to enjoy the concert without falling asleep in the middle of the concert. Sleep is very important so it would be ideal if you have 8 to 10 hours of sleep.  , Check that everyone is coming and no one has anything to do that day or that they are ill. This means that you and your friends can sort out how much money they need to bring and that they know what transport you are getting to the concert e.g train, bus, car.  If A teacher and students are coming with you, pick your best friend to stay with when the teacher is unavailable., The venue website can also update you of changes.   Some bands actually go on stage at the time indicated on the ticket. There might be opening acts before the main artist performs, but don't arrive too late. Country bands, adult contemporary artist and more family oriented events will start closer to the ticket time or at the ticket time.  ,   Some concerts and bands have a fan base which likes to tailgate (huge parking lot party) before the show. The venue can tell you if this is expected for the show you are attending. These festivities can start in the morning and go until show time. Plan to leave early, take food, beverage, toilet paper and a change of clothes. Don't leave your belongings unattended or your car unlocked.  , Make a schedule and share it with anyone attending with you.   Plan your wardrobe ahead of time Withdraw a reasonable amount of cash from the ATM. Pack your tickets, ID, money, cell phone, camera (if allowed), parking passes or any other confirmations. Try to eat before you leave since food at concert venues is usually poor quality or very expensive.  , Once you have your tickets, you may be surprised by the number of people going who you know. Usually, the larger the group the better, and this cuts down on parking fees, gas, etc.   Arrange a neutral meeting place, perhaps someone's house with adequate parking and centrally located. Determine a mutually agreeable time to meet for the carpool. Habitually late friends should be told an earlier time. Larger cities offer mass transit to the venue. Leave early enough to avoid the rush just before show time.  , Dress in layers and consider a light jacket if it's cold. If you are attending at an outdoor venue then consider the weather in advance. The chances are that you will be standing around for a great deal of time waiting for something to happen.   Avoid wearing high heels or sandals. These will feel very uncomfortable as you are standing up for most of the day. High heels will give you a risk you having a twisted ankle. Sandals won't give you a broken ankle but you will still feel uncomfortable or have your toes trodden on. Trainers or sneakers are the best to wear for the concert. If you bring a jumper or coat these should be stored in the cloakroom facility as it is too hot to wear. If you are female, try not to wear anything that might get sexual attention if you don't want it, it's honestly not your fault if you do, just a extremely handy tip. Avoid wearing too much makeup. This won't look great if you are crying or sweating. Sometimes the place of concert can get very hot. If possible don't wear it at all. If you don't feel comfortable without it, then just wear waterproof products and use a little bit. Not all venues have coat checks and the ones that do may be very busy before an after the show. It's best you bring something manageable.  , Assume your bag will be searched upon entering the venue. Some bands and venues also have attendees patted down or frisked for weapons or prohibited items. They will have women pat down women and men for checking other men. Listen to instructions on the way in and the process should only take a few seconds.   Hide your camera if you forgot to leave it in the car. Try to carry a bag that is easy to manage while at the show. The less you carry, the better. Bags should be worn over your head or easily fit between feet on the floor. The best bags close completely to avoid being picked as you walk through the crowd.  , Should you leave your seat for any reason you may be asked to show your ticket to return. You also may be subject to ticket searches once you have already been seated.   If you often leave your seats to mosh, dance, cruise the crowd, etc., store your items in pockets or with a friend and leave your bag at home.  , You will not be admitted with it and thrown out if you are caught with it.  , Some larger, international bands have started prohibiting phones in concerts because of the video and camera options. Check with the venue or artist sites for any drastic bans on items.   Smoking is prohibited in most venues. Some offer exterior or smoking areas. Be considerate and observe the rules regardless of the behavior of those around you.  , This is important if there is an emergency or if you and your friends get split up. Use the phone to call each other.  , Use your usual toiletries.  , Bring a small bag if possible. If you have a big bag it can get in people's way and it can weigh you down if you are in the standing area or waiting for the gates to open. All you need is money, phone, a snack, your travel card and the tickets.  , You will be going to the concert until late at night and it is good to eat something.   The concert will last until late at night and having food in your stomach means that you won't be likely to feel sick in the middle of the concert. Food at the venue is really expensive so it is ideal you go somewhere to get something to eat.  , Notify them of anyone doing anything dangerous, improper or illegal.  , If they aren't allowed you should use common sense and discretion before attempting to take photographs.   They may ask you to stop, confiscate your property or detain you for a portion of the show. You may be able to plead ignorance once but don't abuse the warning. Apologize, put your camera away and don't let them see it again. Most security or staff would prefer to warn you than throw you out but don't push your luck by ignoring the warning. Video is usually more frowned upon than pictures and bring about swifter actions by the staff. Photos taken with camera phones are still photos. They may confiscate your phone. If you are able to get it back that night, it may be damaged, missing the sim card, in a box with 20 other phones that look just like yours and not available until an hour or more after the show.  , Many people enjoy them, it gives you more bang for your money and it is a great way to see up and coming artists. Although sometimes these are smaller bands they are usually a style of music which compliments the headliner. If you are not interested, now would be a good time to locate your friends.  ,   Buying early gives you the best selection of band merchandise for sale.  , If you get dehydrated, you are likely to faint or feel dizzy. Drink water now and then. Keep a water bottle with you if you need it.  , Merchandise tables, beer and wine sales, concession stands often close before the show ends. Don't assume you will get it on the way out. It may not be available.   Plan to arrive early to buy merchandise, especially if a coat check or cloak room is offered. If you buy a t-shirt place it inside a jacket pocket to save having to pay for two cloakroom passes.  , Many people leave early or before the final encore and the house lights go up. Feel free to stay and enjoy the show. You may even be able to slip into a now vacant seat for the finale.   You came to the concert to have fun, so be sure to enjoy the music. Make sure that you take lots of photos at the concert, so that you can look back on it in the future!  ,,, Many municipalities alter traffic patterns and have traffic officers coordinating the departing traffic.

The merchant will check the card, process it, and send you a monthly payment for the amount you are owed. The merchant does most of the work for you, allowing you to focus on developing your products, services and customers.If you use a reputable third-party merchant, your customers are more likely to buy goods from you online if they know their credit card information will be secure and safe. This is why it is important that you do your research and look for a merchant that is trusted by business owners and consumers. Credit card issuers, like MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express, will also charge a fee for the use of their card in addition to the processing fees by the third-party merchants.; , A third-party merchant is a good option for businesses who do not want to have to pay high upfront fees for processing software and computer hardware to run transactions. Many small businesses who process less than $1000 in transactions a month and want to have the option of running online payments as well as international sales will opt for a third-party merchant. Possibly the biggest benefit of a third-party merchant is that many third-party merchants do not require credit checks, making them very appealing to businesses with low credit scores or poor credit histories.One of the biggest disadvantages of using a third-party merchant is that most merchants charge a higher percentage for each transaction than if you have your own online merchant account. This is why it may be useful to view third-party merchants as a stepping stone for your company to help you get started and set up. Though you will initially pay higher setup fees and and software fees, having your own merchant account might be a better investment in the long term, especially if you can maintain a good credit score., As third-party merchants become more popular, the list of providers continues to grow. There are several third-party merchants that are more used than others. You should research several different merchants to find the one that is best for your business. Most of these merchants allow you to sell products in person to customers at a brick-and-mortar location and online through an online store. Several top third-party merchants include:PayPal Here: This is perhaps one of the most popular options for a third-party merchant. It is managed through the online-payment service PayPal. You use PayPal Here by attaching a small blue triangle to your iPhone, iPad, or Android phone. You can also use PayPal Here through an app on your computer. The funds are either deposited into your PayPal account directly or on a special Debit MasterCard account. Customers can pay you by credit card or with their PayPal account. Square: This third-party merchant is also popular with online businesses and brick-and-mortar retail businesses. You use it by attaching a small white square to your iPhone, iPad, or Android phone or through a Square app on your computer. Funds are then transferred nightly into your business checking account. Customers can pay by credit card or through their phone. Intuit GoPayment: This is another option that works by attaching a grey bar on your iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or Android phone. The funds are then transferred nightly into your business checking account. However, there is currently no system for customers who want to pay using their phone. This option is good for businesses who use QuickBooks, as transactions can be downloaded through GoPayment into QuickBooks software. PayByWeb: This merchant is popular for its ability to support several different payment methods, from credit cards to checks by phone and online payments. You can sell products internationally to US and non-US customers, but it only supports US dollars. A complete list of third-party merchant providers can be found online. Try looking for it on any of the major credit card issuers' websites, like that of American Express or Visa., You should evaluate at least two to three different third-party merchants to determine which merchant will work best for your business. Start by looking at any start up fees the merchant charges for use of their service. Most of the popular third-party merchants, such as PayPal Here or Square, have no setup fees. Some third-party merchants charge a very small setup fee, around $40-$50., Transaction fees are the fees charged for each completed transaction. Most third-party merchants will take a low percentage of the total transaction amount as their transaction fee. Some third-party merchants also have a low per-transaction fee that is charged on top of the percentage fee. You should look at the listed transaction fees for each third-party merchant and determine what you can afford to pay for each transaction.For example, PayPal charges a transaction fee of 1.9% - 2.9% of the transaction total, plus $0.30 per transaction. If your business tends to process lots of transactions every day and you want the lowest rate available, you may go for this option.  , Some third-party merchants will put a temporary hold on 5-10% of your transaction revenue. This will act as a safeguard against any returned items or charge backs due to the reversal of a charge or a transaction. You should ask the third-party merchant about their reserve percentage, if any. You may want a third-party merchant that does not require a reserve percentage so you have access to your total transaction revenue at all times.If a charge is reversed, the merchant is likely to offset returns against current payments or bill the seller.  , Most merchants will process payments through in-person transactions and online transactions. But some merchants will also process transactions over the phone, by fax, or by mail.You should also look into the payment types that are supported by the third-party merchant. You may be looking for a merchant who will support all major credit card networks (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express), as well as online payments. Note that some of these credit card networks may charge higher fees than others, even when processed through the same third-party merchant. Some merchants may also access checks by phone, where the customer takes a picture of a check on their phone and it is processed through their bank’s app as a form of payment.  , The third-party merchant should list any restrictions or limitations up front. There may be restrictions on whether the merchant will handle only “tangible,” or physical, products. There may also be limitations on how much money you can process through the service: you may be limited to a minimum amount and a maximum amount each month.Most merchants can handle both tangible products and intangible products, as well as online products and services. But you should make sure the merchant can process both types if you plan to sell products in store and online.  , If you plan to use the third-party merchant to process in person transactions, you will receive a processing chip from the merchant that you can attach to your smart phone. The processing chip usually slides right onto the front of your smart phone. You will then slide the customer’s credit card through the chip and process transactions this way. This option is ideal for businesses who do small transactions throughout the day at a small storefront or market-style booth., If your business has a brick-and-mortar location that tends to run a high number of transactions throughout the day, you may opt for using your business computer to run transactions. You can download and set up the merchant’s processing app on your business computer. You can then use the app, in tandem with the processing chip, to run transactions through the merchant service., If you are running an online store, you should put an order form or shopping cart on your site to process transactions through the merchant. Each merchant will have their own method for doing this. They may also provide premade forms that you can place on your website and customize for your business. Talk to your chosen merchant about setting up this option on your online site., Most third-party merchants offer technical support for any issues or problems you may have with their service. You should get in contact with the merchant if you encounter any glitches with their service, especially if you have never used a third-party merchant before. They should be able to troubleshoot the issues with you to ensure their service works as it is supposed to and supports your business needs.

Carefully shift the weight of your body to the injured foot and then hold it there for 15 seconds if you can. If you can’t, just stand on your injured ankle for as long as you can—it will get easier with time and practice.   As you progresses, try to stand on your injured foot for 45 seconds. Do two sets of this exercise with 10 to 15 repetitions, two or three times a day. To make the leg stand as hard as possible, close your eyes while standing on a cushion.  , The standing calf raise is done by standing up straight and then lifting your uninjured foot partially off the floor. Your injured foot should have its heel lifted but your toes should remain on the floor, as if you were wearing high heels. Try not to hold on to anything while you do this to increase your stability.   Do two sets of 10 or 15 reps, two to three times a day.  , Sit in a chair and raise your injured ankle up so that it is out in front of you. Pretend that your big toe (or even your whole food) is a pen. Write the alphabet in the air, keeping in mind that your ankle will most likely feel pretty stiff in the beginning—it will get easier with time and practice.   Once you have written the alphabet, try to write the alphabet backwards.  , The windshield wiper is done by sitting on a chair with your foot flat on the floor facing straight. Move your injured foot carefully inward then outward. Your foot and ankle should reflect the way a windshield wiper moves back and forth across a window. Do two sets of 10 to 15 reps, 2 to 3 times a day.  , Eversion refers to turning or moving your foot outward, while inversion means turning your foot in towards your body. You can do the eversion and inversion exercise by standing next to a leg table or door jamb. When doing the eversion, you push against the table leg or door jam with your foot and ankle. To do the inversion, put your foot on the other side of the table leg or door jam and pull it towards you.Hold each push or pull for 2 to 3 seconds. Do two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, two or three times a day.  , You can also do eversion and inversion exercises with an elastic band. The same principle is applied. You loop the elastic band on your foot while the other end is tied on a heavy object. When doing the eversion, turn your foot away from your body. When doing the inversion, turn your foot towards the center of your body.   Do two sets of 10 to 15 reps, two or three times day.  , If you have done this exercise and found it to be easy, make it harder by adding some more challenges. Stand on a folded up towel or cushion because both of these things create an unstable surface that you have to work hard to stand still on.   You can also make the single leg stand harder by closing your eyes. When you don’t have a point of reference to look at, you may find that it is harder to keep your balance. You can also do this exercise as a sitting calf raise. Sit on a chair with your foot flat on the floor. Slowly lift your heel up while keeping your toes on the ground.

"['be polite and direct', 'use “i” language', 'communicate your needs to your boss', 'keep records of any ongoing problems you may have with a coworker', 'find a support network at work', 'look at conflict as an opportunity']",How to Deal with Problems at Work1," Don’t beat around the bush when you have a problem with your coworker. It is usually easier to address the problem as soon as it comes up, rather than stew over it or get someone else involved.Be informal about it the first time you address the person. You could say, “Hey, Jack, I’ve been noticing that you’ve been returning the truck almost on empty lately. Could you remember to bring it back with a full tank next time?” If the behavior continues after you have informally addressed your concern, you may need to ask your supervisor to intervene. Follow your company’s rules on handling employee conflict resolution.; , It is important to listen to your coworkers needs respectfully and to try to see their point of view. It is also important to express yourself in a respectful manner. When discussing issues with a coworker, make sure you don’t make them feel defensive when you speak to them. You can do this by using “I” statements. The other person hears your reactions to the situation, not your accusations.Instead of saying, “We are always waiting on you to get your portion of the work done,” you could use “I” language and say, “When the work isn’t in on time, I get really stressed out. I end up needing to work later to get caught up. So it’s really helpful to me if everyone can get the project back on the agreed-upon day.” You could say, “While I appreciate feedback, your comment on my work the other day felt very personal and upset me.”  , You may or may not get along well with your supervisor, but keep the lines of communication open between the two of you as best you can. Remember that it is part of your boss’ responsibility to ensure that you are in an environment that enables you to get your work done, so do not feel like you need to keep concerns from them.Remember that you and your boss do not need to be friends, you just need to be able to work together. (This goes for all of your coworkers, too.) It’s okay to maintain a professional distance from the person if you don’t really care for them. If you are having a difficult time communicating and getting along with your boss, you may wish to bring your concerns to your HR department or, if you don’t have an HR department, talk to your boss’ supervisor. You could say, “Ms. Jones, I’m coming to you because I’ve been having some problems working with Mr. Roberts lately. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what to do.” If your boss doesn’t have a boss (for example, they run a small business), and you are having a difficult time working with them, it may be best you begin looking for another job.  , If you are dealing with a coworker bullying or harassing you, be sure you are keeping track of all incidents with that person. Record the date, time, what happened, and if there were any witnesses.Be sure to find out what your employer’s protocol is in dealing with coworker conflict, bullying, and/or harassment. Your employee handbook or human resources representative would be a good source of information. Research laws protecting your rights when you are being bullied or harassed by a coworker.  , You spend a lot of time with the same group of people at work; why not get to know some of them better? Try to make some good connections with others, and develop a network of friends who can help you through your work (and life) frustrations.Spend your lunch break with your coworkers and get to know them better away from work. Spend a few minutes chatting with your coworkers each day. Invite them to get together after work. You could say, “Would you like to grab dinner after work tomorrow?” This can be a good way to get to know your colleagues better. If you feel comfortable doing so, then you might even invite them to happy hour with you to grab a drink after work.  , If you and a coworker are disagreeing on how a project needs to proceed, refuse to take the disagreement personally. Instead, look at the conflict as an opportunity to learn from the other person.You could say, “Kristin, I have to admit that I don’t understand your approach. Could you tell me more about why you want to go in this direction?” Avoid getting personal when giving feedback to a colleague. For example, it would be better to say, “I think we need more detail in this section,” rather than “If you hadn’t waited until the last minute to get this in, you could have given us more information.”  ","['work', 'records', 'ongoing problems', 'language', 'boss', 'opportunity', 'support network', 'coworker', 'conflict', 'needs']"

Check with the tonneau cover manufacturer if possible, or follow these rules of thumb:If a bed liner gets in the way during installation, just cut a notch where you need to fit a clamp or other cover part. If the bed liner wraps over the rails and your tonneau cover lies between rails (instead of above them), the two parts might not both fit on your truck. Most bed rail caps won't affect installation, but diamond plate bed rail caps will prevent some covers from fitting, or from forming a weather-tight seal.; , A closed tailgate can interfere with installation.  , Most tonneau covers come with two side rails, which fit onto the top or side of the truck's bed rails. Place a side rail flush with the front of the bed rail, next to the cab. Hold it in place temporarily with a spring clamp, or have an assistant keep hold of it.   If your cover does not come with rails, the cover itself should have clamps that swing down from the underside once the cover is in place.These covers are less stable and not weatherproof, but easy to remove and reinstall. If you have a retractable tonneau cover, which comes in a canister, you may need to position this before you place the rails. Put the canister on the edge of the bed rails, next to the cab. Center this perfectly before you attach the rails to the canister., Your installation kit should come with several toothed clamps. Take one of these and fit it onto the underside of the side rail, near the cab. Line up the teeth of the clamp with the grooves, then tighten by hand. Tighten a few times with a wrench or socket wrench, just enough to feel it pressing against the bed rail., Look at the underside of the rail. If there is any gap at all between the truck, place shims evenly along the bed rail to close the gap. These are plastic or rubber spacers that stick directly onto the bed rail.   If there's a large gap (more than about ⅜ inches / 10mm), you might need shim brackets instead. Unclamp the rail, slide the shim brackets onto the end, space them out evenly, and reclamp the rail.Your kit may not come with shim brackets, or may have shim brackets that attach with a slightly different design.  , Most installation kits come with eight clamps (four per side), but a short bed may only require six (three per side). Attach these the same way you did the first clamp, spacing them evenly along the rails.   Some soft tonneau cover instructions recommend skipping this step until the end, so you can make final adjustments more easily. Don't try this for a hard cover, which needs a firm  , Install the second rail the same way.  , The two rails should be perfectly parallel with each other, in line with the bed rails, and as far back as they can go. If necessary, loosen the clamp slightly and adjust the rails, then reclamp. If a rail is tilted, lower or raise the position of the clamp, or push down on the raised end of the rail while tightening the clamp.Take your time over this step. The cover will not install properly if the rails are out of position.   If there is a gap between your bed rails and the cab, the side rails should not extend into this gap. The rails will not necessarily be level with the closed tailgate.  , Once you are certain the rails are properly align, finish tightening the front clamp of each rail with a wrench. Repeat with the other clamps, moving toward the rear of the truck.  , Weatherproof covers should come with a rubber seal to fill the gap between the cover and the cab. Wipe down this area with rubbing alcohol to make a good bonding surface.Peel off the backing paper and stick it onto the cab between the two side rails, starting from the driver's side. Cut off the excess and discard.   Some tonneaus come with additional seals for the sides or tailgate, and/or larger corner plugs to weatherproof the rear corners.  , Some installation kits have components that may be easier to install before you position the cover. Check your kit for the following:   Storage straps, fed through holes in the cover. Tension adjuster screws, for hand tightening of the cover. These usually attach to the side rails, and may come pre-installed. Hinged covers and some hard folded covers include a rod to prop the cover open. This should snap or screw into place somewhere on one of the side rails, with the other end resting on a small cradle.  , This will be much easier with two or more people, especially if the cover is a hard cover or your truck is lifted. Place the rolled or folded cover at the end of the rails, next to the cab. It should fit perfectly onto the rails, although you may need to push down to get it in place. This must be perfectly centered and slotted onto the side rails before you continue.   If you cannot center the cover, place it back on the ground and readjust the rails. Hinged hard covers (one solid piece without folds) are extremely heavy. They cannot be installed safely by a single person. Use a forklift or several helpers., Shut the tailgate. Carefully unroll or unfold the cover until it reaches your tailgate, keeping it in the rails along its whole length. Make small adjustments to cover positioning until it is flush with the tailgate and the cab end of the side rails.   Look for a small hand-tightened screw on the rail to adjust cover tension. It should lie taut across your bed, completely covering it.  , Depending on your model, the cover may have already snapped onto the rail as you unfolded it. Most covers also come with elevator bolts or other large bolts for additional securing. Align the bolt holes on the cover with the bolt holes on the side rails, and tighten securely with the washers and nuts included in your kit.   Some covers have clamps or levers on the underside, which lower to brace the cover against the bed side.  , Check all clamps on the cover rails and tighten them securely. Check all other attachment points to make sure the cover is firmly in place and cannot shift or come loose.  , Some tonneau covers come with drainage tubes to divert rain, bump stops to protect your cab from dings when a hard cover is opened, or various other optional components.

Place a clock that makes a rhythmic ticking sound nearby. You can also try playing the radio softly or use a white noise machine to help the puppy sleep. Consider using a heating pad under half of the crate to provide a warmer corner for cuddling.   Since the heating pad is outside and under the crate, the puppy should not be in any danger of chewing on the cord or pad.; , If you want your dog to sleep in a crate, but he isn't crate-trained it may take some time to get him used to the crate. Do your research and be prepared to teach your dog that the crate is a good place. Put special treats in the back of crate to encourage investigation. Make sure that when you say ""kennel"" or ""crate"" you use a positive tone of voice. This tells him that going into the crate to sleep isn't a punishment.   If you use it as a punishment, you may find that your dog never grows accustomed to the crate as a relaxing and quiet place.  , Your dog may be restless at night if he's not getting enough exercise during the day. Depending on your dog’s breed, age and fitness level, you may be able to tire him out in 30 minutes or 3 hours (or more).You can exercise your dog at any time during the day that works with your schedule. Although, it's best to avoid a lot of activity the last hour or two before bedtime so that your dog has a chance to settle down.   Consider playing a new sport or activity like NoseWork, Rally, agility, tracking or Flyball with your dog.New activities mean learning new skills for both of you. Getting involved will increase mental and physical stimulation which helps both of you with exercise, boredom and will add to your bond.  , Make sure that your pet has had a chance to urinate and defecate right before bedtime. Feed your dog dinner a few hours before bedtime. This gives him plenty of time to digest and eliminate. Try keeping the hour or so before bedtime nice and calm which will set the tone for the night’s sleep to come.   If your dog is overly anxious, try giving him Adaptil. This is a product that replicates the pheromones of a nursing mother dog and may help settle your dog or puppy by reducing anxiety., Any changes in sleeping arrangements may take a while to get used to. Making sure that your dog gets plenty of exercise to the point of being tired is a great way to ensure a good night’s sleep for you two. Talk to your vet about using an antihistamine like Benadryl to help settle your dog for a few nights during a transitional period.  , Perhaps there are other issues causing a bit of unrest in your dog. Are you packing for a trip or moving? Are there guests in the house? A new neighbor? Loud noises? Just remember, dogs appreciate a routine. A small change to you (like moving your bedroom furniture) may seem like a big deal to the dog.   Some dogs are more anxious than others, so be patient and think about things from your dog’s perspective. Then, you can make changes accordingly.  , If this is an older dog that has been quiet and content before, try to determine if there is a medical problem. Talk to your veterinarian about any unexplained changes in your dog's behavior, including appetite, energy level and ability to move comfortably.   Pain or needing to go outside to eliminate in the middle of the night can cause a pet to whine and be restless during the night.  , It may take a few days (and nights) to adjust to the new household and routine. Establish ground rules at the beginning to create a good routine. This will help your puppy understand the end of day rituals that lead to getting to sleep in the new household. Feed your puppy at the same time in the evening, followed by a trip outside 15-20 minutes later to eliminate.Place the pup in his crate, which should be in your bedroom so that the puppy is close by. This way, he can communicate when he needs to go outside to eliminate during the night.

If you use the paper towel roll, cut it in half. Refer to each half as a separate roll for the remainder of the instructions. Cut one of the rolls in half. Save one half for use as the cow's head and discard the other half. Cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) off one end of the other roll. This roll will become the body of the cow. Discard the excess 1 inch (2.5 cm).  , Using pencil, lightly sketch two ovals onto one end of the head piece, positioning them on opposite sides of the cylindrical perimeter.   These ovals will become ears. Each one should be about one-quarter the length of the tube. Carefully cut along three-quarters of each oval outline, leaving the innermost end of each oval alone. Fold up the cut portions so that they stick out from the sides of the tube, creating ears.  , Draw two small triangles near one end of the tube, centering them in between both ears.   These triangles will become horns. They should be smaller than half the size of one ear. Carefully cut along two edges of each triangle, leaving the innermost edge alone. Fold up the cut portions so that they stick out from the side of the tube, creating horns.  , Cut two compartments out of an empty egg carton. Discard the rest of the carton.   These two sections will become the legs of your cow. One section will form both front legs and the other will form both back legs. Carefully cut out the front and back of both sections, leaving the sides and bottoms intact.  , Paint both cardboard tubes and both egg carton sections white. Allow the paint to dry.   You should paint both sides of the ear slits, but you do not need to paint the horn slits at this time.  , Use black paint to add spots to the head and body of the cow. Let the paint dry when finished.   To create realistic spots, paint spots with uneven sides. Avoid sharp points, opting for rounded corners instead. Note that you should also space the spots apart in uneven intervals instead of creating patterns or symmetry.  , Paint a small pink oval in the front side of each ear. Paint both sides of each horn gray. Let the paint dry.   The pink inner ear should follow the outline of the ear slit, but you should leave some blank white space around the edge of each center.  , Using craft glue, adhere two googly craft eyes onto the face. Allow the glue to dry completely.   Both eyes should lie just in front of the ears along the length of the head. Place each eye in between one horn and one ear along the width (perimeter) of the head.  , Glue both egg carton pieces onto the same side of the body roll. Glue the head onto the opposite side of the body roll.   Turn both carton sections upside-down so that the flat bottoms become the tops. Place one section near the front of the body and the other section near the back. With the cow standing on its egg carton feet, glue the back half of the head onto the top of the body.  , Once everything dries, stuff cotton balls into both open cardboard rolls.   Use enough cotton to tightly back both rolls. If you pack it tightly enough, you should not need to use glue to hold the cotton in place.  , Cut a small piece of pink pipe cleaner out and glue it to the cotton at the front of the face.   The pink pipe cleaner should roughly match the diameter of the cardboard tube. Bend the pipe cleaner into a slight curve to give the cow a smile. Use glue to attach the pipe cleaner to the bottom half of the cotton at the front of the face.  , Cut a small length of white yarn. Use glue to attach one end to the top of the cardboard body at the back of the cow.   The tail should be at least as long as the diameter of the tube, if not a little longer.  , The cardboard cow is finished and ready to admire.

These include the new Kinect sensor, Internet connection, and your set-top box if you wish to view your cable TV shows through the Xbox One.; , Before you do anything, one thing you have to be sure of is that your console is connected to the Internet. You can do a wired connection by using an Ethernet cable to connect it to your Internet source or you can also connect wirelessly if you have a wifi router available.  , Use an HDMI cable to connect your Xbox One to your TV. Connect the HDMI cable to the HDMI OUT port at the rear portion of the Xbox One. The other end of the HDMI cable goes in the HDMI input of your TV. If you have cable or satellite TV, you can connect another HDMI cable into your console’s HDMI IN port and the other end goes to your set-top box for cable or satellite TV.  , Connect your Kinect into the Kinect port at the back of the Xbox One. It is the port in between the USB ports and IR port.   The Kinect sensor cable has a fixed length of 3 meters (9.8 ft) so make sure that your Kinect sensor is close enough to your Xbox One.  , Plug the power supply at the back of the Xbox One into a power source. It is at the leftmost part of the console from the back. Then connect the power cord to the power supply. Lastly, plug in the other end of the power cord straight to your power outlet.   The Xbox One’s LED on the power supply should light up as an indication that there’s power.  , You can turn on your unit by using your wired controller. Simply hold down the Home button on your Xbox One controller to power on both your unit and controller at the same time.   You can also touch the front panel of the Xbox One (where its logo is) to power on the unit. If you are using a wireless controller, make sure you put in batteries first to power on your controller. The Kinect sensor can also be used to turn on your console except during initial setup. You can normally turn on your Xbox One via the Kinect sensor by saying “Xbox On” within your Kinect sensor’s range.  , The first thing you’ll see on-screen is the Xbox One logo with a green background. Wait for it to process a bit and it will eventually give you initial setup instructions.   The first instruction is for you to press A to proceed. It gives you that instruction by showing an Xbox One controller on-screen. Then Xbox One greets you for the first time.  , There are a lot of languages available to choose from including English, Deutsch, Español, and more when you scroll down the options. Select your preferred language then press A.   You will notice that Xbox One on-screen texts automatically translate to the language currently selected as a preview.  , Depending on your selected language, Xbox One will now give you options to select what country you live in.  , You can either choose your wired connection or WiFi (wireless) connection. It is best to choose the wired connection for stability.   In choosing wireless, you may have to provide your router password for access. If Xbox One for some reason fails to discover your router, you can press Y on your controller to refresh scanning.  , Since this is initial setup, you will need to update your Xbox One. This is almost guaranteed for initial setup, regardless of the unit. You need to be connected to the Internet to download the update which is around 500 MB in size.   Your unit will automatically reset after the update.  , After the Xbox One resets, it will ask you to press the controller’s Home button to continue with the rest of the setup. First up, select your time zone. Again, the default selection will depend on the country you selected previously.  , Setting up the Kinect sensor will allow you to sign in automatically via Kinect recognition, control Xbox One with voice and hand motions, chat with other Kinect users, and control your TV.   Make sure you have speakers connected to your Xbox One for the Kinect setup to properly gauge speaker volume. Keep quiet when the instructions ask you to. This will affect the Kinect sensor’s setup.  , You can use the email and password associated with your current gamer tag. If you don’t have an existing gamer tag, you can use your Skype, Outlook.com, Windows 8, or Windows phone’s credentials instead.   If you don’t have accounts on any of the alternatives, you must create a new Microsoft account to proceed.  , View and accept the Xbox Live terms of use. After accepting, you will be given the Privacy statement.  , You will have the chance to pick your color preference for your Xbox One’s color theme. Upon selecting, you will be given a preview of what your dashboard will look like.  , Before ending the setup, Xbox One will ask if you wish to save your password. It is advisable to save it to prevent the unit from asking your password every time you log in, but if you are concerned about who uses the device, then do not save the password.   You will also be asked if you want the Kinect sensor to automatically log you in upon recognition.  , Now, press your controller’s Home button to end the setup and visit your Xbox One dashboard with your chosen color theme.

"['choose what applications they can use', 'buy a monitoring program', 'toggle location settings', 'deal with their social media accounts', 'look for inappropriate activity']",How to Monitor Your Child's Smartphone Use2," It’s important to do a little research before you allow your child to download applications and use them. For one, know what the age limits are for certain apps or social media sites. If you know an application may be risky or dangerous, do not allow your child to download it. If they do want to download an application, have them state their reasons why they’d like to use it and any potential dangers it may have.   Most social media websites restrict young children from registering. A child must be 13 or older to use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat, and Pinterest. YouTube’s age requirement is 18, but if a child is 13 or older they can sign up with parental permission. Yoursphere (a kids social network) is designed specifically for children’s safety and privacy.  , You can purchase tools to monitor your child’s phone activity from your own phone or computer. These programs tend to be extensive in the information you can see, so adjust what content on your child’s cell phone you want to monitor. If you have multiple children with a cell phone, many programs allow customization for up to five cell phones.Some programs let you log on to check activity, while others also allow you to set up alerts to your child’s activity.  , Some parents may want all location services turned off to protect their child’s privacy. This can keep applications from sharing their location or disallowing “checking in”. Others parents, however, may want to use software to track where their child is at a given time. If you’re concerned your child says they’re going one place yet are suspicious you are going somewhere else, this application can be helpful for confirmation.Do some research for providers that offer location tracking. You can find a web-based program or look into applications on your own phone that can track another phone.  , Decide how you will handle their social media accounts. You may choose to not let them install social media applications on their phone and only let them use social media on the family computer. Decide what accounts they are allowed to have and as always, toggle the security settings to protect their privacy.   For a younger child or for a child who may be at a higher risk, have their social media passwords so that you can monitor their activity. As they get older or more mature, you may wish to relax your rules.Friend or follow your child on their social media accounts. This is a step down from having their passwords, yet still allows you to see what they’re doing and posting. However, beware if your child sets up a different or secret account that you do not follow., If you’re monitoring your child’s phone, look out for any inappropriate content. This can occur over social media or messaging applications. Inappropriate content can occur in comments, posts, emails, texts, or photos. It can also be an image your child shares. If your child posts something inappropriate, have them remove it right away. If necessary, have them apologize to anyone who may have been hurt.If your child posts something illegal (such as a nude photo), do not share it or spread it in any way. Contact the police right away.  ","['applications', 'monitoring program', 'inappropriate activity', 'toggle location settings', 'social media accounts']"

Hold onto your question until you’re prompted for it. That way, your teacher will be able to reach a good stopping point and give you a detailed answer.   Familiarize yourself with the way things are normally done in your classroom. Your teacher might encourage students to ask questions during the lesson, or they may prefer that you save them for a designated time. If the teacher doesn’t invite questions, wait for a pause before asking.; , This is the most common and courteous way of letting your teacher know that you have a question. Raising your hand lets you signal quietly so that you don’t interrupt the lesson or disturb your classmates. It will also help you get noticed in a room full of students.Keep your hand up until your teacher acknowledges you. They may not see you right away. Don’t wave your arm around in an effort to be seen. This can be very distracting.  , If your teacher fails to notice that you have your hand up, you can politely alert them before you get left behind in the lesson. Simply say “excuse me,” or get their attention by saying their name. Wait until you’re called on before you begin talking.Be respectful. Pestering or talking over your teacher will just make you look like you’re trying to cause a scene.  , You may already have the information you need to find out what it is you want to know. Before you ask a question, think it over and make sure it’s something you can’t find out on your own. Review your textbook and notes and look for the answer there.   Learning to search for answers independently can improve your study habits and make you more resourceful. It can be somewhat embarrassing to ask a question when the answer is right in front of you.  , A lot of students tend to be shy about asking questions, but there’s no reason to be. Think of questions as a tool you can use to make learning more effective. Even if the answer is a simple one, the fact that you had the presence of mind to ask will show that you’re engaged with the course material.Chances are, someone else in the class has the same question and is too timid bring it up.Once you’ve gotten comfortable expressing yourself in class, you’ll be more confident about asking questions in the future., Articulate your words and make sure the teacher and the rest of the class can hear you. That way, you won’t be forced to repeat yourself.   You should talk loud enough to be heard clearly, but try not to shout. Muttering or talking under your breath may make you hard to hear.  , There’s no need to ramble on and on or preface the question with other sorts of statements. Make it short and to the point. Your teacher will be better able to answer you, and you won’t lose any important class time.To avoid confusion, the first thing you say should be a key question word: who, what, where, when, why or how.  , Point out exactly what you need clarified. This could be anything from a particular date, figure or spelling to more involved questions like the meaning of an idiom or a breakdown of the individual steps in a biological process. The key is to word your question carefully so that you can receive the information you’re missing.“What year did the French Revolution start?” is a better question than “when was that, again?” You could also phrase your question as a request—for instance, “could you spell that?” or “would it be possible to see that previous slide again?” Avoid asking questions that are vague or open-ended.  , Look directly at the teacher while they’re answering you, or take notes so that you can look them over later. Nod occasionally to indicate that you understand what you’re being told. Once the answer has been explained satisfactorily, thank the teacher.If you’re still having trouble grasping something, ask the teacher for clarification before you move on. Don’t interrupt or let your eyes wander around the room. This could be considered rude.  , There may not be enough time to answer all of your questions, especially if it’s near the end of the period and other students have questions of their own. In these cases, you can approach your teacher after class and have them clear up anything you’re still uncertain about.Lay out your questions one at a time so your teacher will have an easier time answering them. College students can also schedule an appointment to speak to their professors during office hours., Make a list of difficult problems and concepts that you encounter in your out-of-class assignments. You may discover the answer on your own as you continue studying. If not, you can get your teacher to address these questions before the beginning of the following class period.Identifying ideas you don't understand will help you do better on future assignments. Show up a little early for the next class so you’ll have an opportunity to discuss your questions in depth.  , If you just can’t overcome your anxiety of speaking in class, it’s okay to type your question out in a message. Email is convenient because you can one anytime a question arises, whether you’re in class or not. You’ll still get the same response, and you’ll have the freedom to check back for an answer throughout the day.Put the main idea of the question in the email’s subject line so that your teacher will know what to expect from your message. If time is a factor (such as right before a big exam), be sure to send your email well enough in advance to ensure that you’ll receive a reply in time. Another benefit of email is that you can archive it and look it over later should you happen to forget the answer.

If you are unsure, consult the directions for your sewing machine and adjust settings accordingly. Also prepare your sewing machine by threading it with a thread that matches the color and strength of the material you are going to sew.   This is also a good time to plug in your iron, so that it's already heated up when you need it.; , Putting the wrong sides together is the opposite of what is normally done when sewing a basic seam, so don't worry if it feels counterintuitive. A French seam requires you to stitch each seam twice, folding over your first line of stitches in order to make your finished seam face the right direction.   Be sure to pin all the way down the seam you are sewing. This will help to make sure your fabric doesn't slip out of line. It's a good idea to put pins in so they are perpendicular to your seam line, this way they won't stick you as you move the fabric along in the sewing machine and they will be easy to grab as you move your fabric in the sewing machine. , To keep your seam allowance the same width as you sew your seam, keep an eye on the seam allowance guide that should be printed on the thread plate of your machine. Another option is to use a 1/4 inch presser foot, that way you can just make sure the outer edge of your fabric always lines up with the edge of the presser foot.   The seam allowance is the amount of fabric that is between the edge of the fabric and the seam. Patterns usually give a specific amount of seam allowance to use, so that your finished project doesn't turn out too bit or too small. Remember that the french seam will basically require about double the allowance you use on this first seam, so make sure when you are cutting out your pieces of fabric that you have figured that into your measurements. Feel free to increase the seam allowance on this first seam to 3/8 inch, if you are more comfortable sewing that width, but keep in mind that you will need to increase your overall seam allowance to accommodate this. It's best to remove pins right before you are about to sew over them. This will keep the fabric in place but will avoid the risk of hitting one with your sewing machine needle, which could easily break the needle. Remember to clip any threads and remove any remaining pins after sewing.  , You can use regular scissors or pinking shears, but if you are using a delicate fabric, pinking shears may be best to help prevent excessive fraying. Remember, this seam is not going to show by the time you are finished. Don't worry if the cut edge is a bit frayed or messy.   While it would be great if you could just sew a 1/8 inch seam, and therefore not waste any fabric, most sewing machines need more than 1/8 inch of fabric for the machine's feed dogs, the pieces of rough metal under the presser foot, to grab onto and pull along. , Open the pieces of fabric and lay it out flat on an ironing board. Iron across the seam on both the right side and the wrong side of the fabric so it lays perfectly flat. Then fold the fabric so that the right sides are facing each other (the opposite of how it was when you sewed the first seam). Iron the piece with the seam you just sewed going straight down the outer edge of the fabric. You'll want to iron very carefully and neatly so that the seam on the outer edge is perfectly straight.   Make sure your iron is set to the correct temperature for the fabric you are using. If it is set to high you will risk singeing the fabric.        , This should be easy, as you have just ironed them into place. Again, put your pins in horizontally all the way down the side of the seam so that they can be easily removed while you are sewing. The frayed edge should now be concealed between the two pieces of fabric and the outer edge is just the neat row of your first set of stitches.  , You need this amount of allowance so that the frayed edge of the fabric is tucked away neatly between the two seams. As you sew, remove the pins. Once again, remember to clip threads and remove any stray pins after sewing the seam.   If your seam allowance is too small on the second seam, the rough edges of the fabric could end up sticking out of the second seam on the finished side of your project. Its better to be cautious and make your seam allowance a bit generous.  , Press the seam to one side, depending on where you would like it to lay in your finished project. Your raw edges are no longer exposed as they are enclosed inside your newly made French seam.

If she has a closed body position, namely crossed arms or legs, she may be shy or nervous to talk to you or she may simply be creating a barrier to signal that she is uninterested.When she is sitting with her legs crossed, watch her feet. If they are pointed towards you, it might mean that she likes you and wants to get closer to you.; , If a girl likes you, she will tend to either hold her gaze on you for a few seconds or glance down the moment your eyes make contact with hers. Either of these responses could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it often means she is nervous or not ready to reveal her true intentions yet, but she may still like you.   When a girl likes you, her pupils might dilate, though this will be hard to tell.If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, this could mean that she likes you.  , The way you interpret a girl's body language will vary depending on the context. For example, if you're talking one-on-one with a girl, her touching your arm for a few seconds could be considered flirting. However, if she quickly taps your shoulder to get your attention and tell you that your friend is looking for you, she may really just be trying to help, not flirt.   If you are having an intense conversation, a girl may look at you without breaking eye contact. This does not necessarily mean she likes you. It could just be a conversational practice of hers. However, if she makes eye contact with you for an extended period of time without talking, or if she looks at you and breaks away the minute you look back at her, she may be intrigued by you.  , When a girl likes you, she will often try to touch you, as this is a noticeable yet still subtle way to flirt. It allows a girl to size up how responsive you are. She may touch your arm when you say something funny, “accidentally” brush your shoulder or hands with hers, or gently place her hand on your knee.   Not all girls will feel comfortable reaching out using touch. In this case, don't assume that she doesn't like you just because she doesn't try to touch you. She may be too nervous to do so. If you like her, don't be shy––break the touch barrier yourself and see how she responds. She may also find other reasons to touch you, such as softly punching your arm. These ""one-of-the-mates"" moves can be a thinly disguised way of getting closer to you without it being too evident to your friends and hers.  , This is especially significant if her random hugs are reserved mostly for you. Hugs are a friendly, affectionate way of getting closer to you and touching you without it necessarily compromising her stealthy flirting skills. Return the hug if you like her back, or gently refuse her hug if you don’t want her to get the wrong impression.  , If a girl imitates you - for example, if you run your fingers through your hair and you notice her do the same a few seconds later - she may be subconsciously mirroring your movements. This can be a tell that she likes you., Gently twirling strands of her hair or partaking in other grooming behaviors like running her hands through her hair could be signs of flirting.  , When a girl likes you, she will touch her lips, collarbone, or neck to draw your attention to these areas. She may even apply lipstick in front of you., This may be her way of signaling to you that she’s comfortable and happy in your presence. When a girl likes you, she may also laugh at your jokes (regardless of how funny they actually are).

These may be for rabbits or chinchillas, but can be used for the hamster., Pick a container that is made of ceramic, but is fairly shallow. These containers should not be easily overturned. Fill the container enough to allow the entire animal space to roll in it. Allow the hamster a few minutes to roll around in the sand., Use a soft brush or clean Hold the hamster in one hand, or let a helper hold them rag. Gently dust off the hamster with the soft brush or rag.Avoid the eyes, ears, and mouth. Use quick, light strokes.  , Clean the dish out thoroughly with water, and towel dry it to make sure it’s completely dry before a later use.Use a fresh batch of dust or sand each time  , If brushing and bathing doesn’t improve your long haired hamster’s fur then you may resort to trimming. Avoid holding the hamster on its back while you do this. Keep it held in your hand or the hand of a helper. Use a small pair of scissors to trim just a little at a time from the matted fur.Trimming may even be preferable to the hamster Feed the hamster a small piece of fruit or vegetable to keep it calm during the process.  , Get a shampoo specifically designed for hamsters or small pets from a pet store or pet aisle. Set some towels around to protect against splashing.Make sure you’re in an area you don’t mind getting wet like a sink or basin. Wet baths are usually not a great idea for hamster’s as they can remove essential oils from the hamster’s coat.  , Use a soft grooming brush. Hold the hamster in one hand, or let a helper hold them. Pour a little of the shampoo onto the brush with some warm water. Work it into the hamster’s fur with brief light stokes.Avoid the eyes, mouth, and ears.  , Use a soft towel. You can cradle the hamster in the towel as long as the hamster has support, and feels safe. Make sure to gently pad down all of the hamster’s fur so it’s dry. Don’t be so rough you scrape the skin.If the hamster seems to be panicking or squirming then revert to the single hand-held method.  , Check for drafts. You want to make sure the hamster is not exposed to any cold air vents, wind, fans, or anything else that might make it cold while wet. You need to leave it in this warm place until its fur is completely dry.You might want to leave some rags, treats, and toys for the hamster to have while it waits.  , Use a pair of small human nail clippers or nail clippers designed for a pet such as a cat. Hold the hamster in one hand or the hand of a helper and clip the lower tips of the nails. You want to take extra care not to clip too far up the nail and risk clipping a blood vessel. If you trim the “quick” or blood vessel then you can use some baking soda on the area to help stop the bleeding.Usually a hamster wears down their toenails through digging and climbing, but if the nails are growing so long they harm the hamster’s ability to walk or function then you can try trimming them.  , Remove the hamster to a temporary holding area like a shoebox. Completely remove all bedding from the main cage into a trash bag or similar disposable container. Thoroughly cleanse the cage with water, and dry it with towels or paper towels. Once try replace the bedding with a less entangling material.Tangles can occur with paper bedding too, but this might be a slightly better option. Consider sawdust as a bedding material.  , You can buy chew toys from a pet store. You can also improvise some gnawing elements for the hamster by putting in a small piece of untreated wood or tiny untreated branch from a hardwood tree. These all need to be pesticide free. Hamster teeth, like that of other small rodents, grow continuously. Hamsters need something to gnaw on to keep their teeth at a comfortable length. Trees that tend have good wood for hamsters to chew include aspen, oak, apple, and cherry.  , Do short cleaning sessions especially with the brush and bathing techniques first. Increase the time you spend cleaning the hamster’s fur for each session until you can get a complete cleaning and drying session performed.Matted fur can be a problem as the coat comes in later, but you want the hamster used to the cleaning routine early  ","['dust bath', 'container', 'bedding', 'warm place', 'long nails', 'dust', 'cage', 'wet bath', 'bathing dish', 'teeth length', 'sand', 'fur', 'sessions', 'objects', 'hamster']"

You may buy your duct tape at a hardware store or find a greater variety of colors and patterns at an arts and crafts store. You may also find unique designs online.; , Create fabric out of duct tape by cutting 16 strips of duct tape that measure 32 inches (81.3 cm) long and 2 inches wide. This will create 2 sheets of fabric, one for each panel of your tie as conventional ties are commonly constructed using two panels., Place the strips on a flat surface with the sticky side up. Lay one horizontally and the next one beside it but overlap the edge slightly. Continue to do this until you have four strips wide., Place strips of duct tape over the four adjoining strips so that the sticky portions face one another. Measure and lay down each strip with purpose as the tape will be difficult to adjust once two sticky faces are pushed together. Once you have 8 strips, 4 on each side, you finished a single panel of fabric., A traditional tie is composed of 2 panels that make up the top of the tie and the neck portion. Create a second panel of fabric for the second part of the tie by, again, overlapping 4 strips of duct tape and closing the panel with another 4 strips., Choose a tie that is a size you’re looking for, don’t choose a thick tie if you want a thin tie. Smooth the fabric so that it lays flat onto one of the panels., Use a pencil or sharpie to trace the tie but be careful not to stain your cloth tie. Make sure that you press hard enough to see the outline but not hard enough to puncture the duct tape. Felt works well but may easily be smudged if not careful., Each panel should be use for a different part of you old tie. Use the second panel for the neck portion of your tie. Again, spread the fabric out flat onto the second duct tape panel., Using a pencil or marker, trace the skinny portion of your tie onto the second panel of duct tape fabric. If your tie is skinny the entire length, the neck portion is the part of your tie that will be closest to your chest and most likely covered by the other portion of fabric., Use scissors to cut out both pieces of your tie from the duct tape fabric. Cut carefully as you do not want to damage the main pieces. If you used a marker, you can choose to include the outline to give a bold silhouette., Tape the ends of the tie that will be closest to your face. Depending on the design you have chosen, the end of your tie may be angled. In this case, the points of your tie should be away from your face, pointed toward your feet and not be taped together.It is common to use the same color duct tape to tape the 2 portions of your tie together; but, you may want a contrast and use a different colored tape., Use markers to let your creativity shine. Whether you create stripes, patterns, logos, or words, markers are a quick way to add flair. You may also add stripes by using a few strips of different colored duct tape. Cut them at the angle and size suitable for your tie.Use a sharp utility knife to create complex patterns or intricate designs.Be sure to only decorate a third of the way up so that the decorations doesn’t get obstructed by your collar or peeled off., Measure your duct tape and your neck before cutting. In case you’re trying to make an comically large or small bow tie, adjust the measurements once you’ve perfected the technique. , The ends should slightly overlap as they come together at the center and the duct tape should now measure about 4 inches (10 cm) in length. Measure and lay down each strip with purpose as the tape will be difficult to adjust once two sticky faces are pushed together., Create an accordion as you fold the piece 3 times. You should now be able to see your bow tie come together. Cut a small strip of duct tape to create the center of your bow tie. Leave enough length to fold over the center of the accordion while leaving enough space for the neck piece.Create a small a small loop. This will both secure your bowtie in place and complete the traditional bow tie design as the accordion sides flare out.  , Use measuring tape to make sure you create a neckpiece that is both snug and comfortable. Cut a strip of duct tape to your neck measurement and fold it into quarters so that there is no sticky side remaining. Put the neck piece through the bow and maneuver your bowtie into place.  , Pick up sticky velcro from your local arts supply store and attach it to either end of your neck piece. Do not tie your neck piece as it may ruin the material and overall look. Sticky velcro is easy to apply and adjust. Use a mirror and stick the ends together to complete your look.

This ability is pretty straightforward, although you need to be quick and accurate enough to heal your ally just when he or she needs it the most. The 9 second cooldown, however, means that you need to pick your targets very carefully. This is why you need to prioritize allies that are being focused down by the enemy to keep them alive. , Lightning Shield is Rehgar’s W ability, which places a buff on the target that damages nearby enemies and damages nearby enemies over the duration of Lightning Shield. This ability is great when used on melee heroes that can stick close to their target, as it gives them bonus damage that can force enemies to retreat from the continuous damage over time effect. This is especially effective when used on tough heroes that can “stick” to the enemy. (e.g. Arthashastra, Diablo, Chen, Stiches etc.), Earthbind Totem is Rehgar’s E ability, which creates a totem on the target area that slows nearby enemies over its lifespan. This ability makes Rehgar a powerful ally when roaming the map to ambush isolated heroes, especially when partnered with another hero that can disable targets from afar and buy time for Rehgar to drop his totem right on their heads. It is also devastating against enemy teams that clump up together during team fights; making it easier for your team to get in position and destroy enemies caught in the totem’s area of effect. And finally, the totem itself has a respectable sight radius, which you can exploit by dropping the totem along enemy paths of approach to spot them if they try to flank you or your teammates., Bloodlust is Rehgar’s first ultimate, which significantly boosts the attack and movement speeds of nearby allies when activated. Of course, heroes that rely on basic attacks to deal most of their damage (e.g. Illidan, Raynor, Tychus etc.) will benefit the most from Bloodlust, but the attack and movement speed buffs will still be immensely useful for your entire team. The added speed is the true clincher here, as it gives you and your teammates an advantage in positioning; making it easier to chase down fleeing enemies or fall back when taking too much damage., Ancestral Healing is Rehgar’s second ultimate ability, which heals a single target hero for a massive amount of health after a short delay. This ultimate ability can give your ally a second life, which is especially useful for warriors that lead the charge and absorb a large chunk of damage for the team. Just remember that it takes about two seconds for the heal to kick in. The cooldown will trigger as you cast Ancestral Healing – regardless of whether your target is healed or not. This means you need to cast Ancestral Healing when the target has lost enough health to make it count but not before the target dies while being focused down by the enemy., Instead of mounting up like most other heroes, pressing the mount key (default Z) causes Rehgar to instantly transform into a Ghost Wolf. He can maintain Ghost Wolf form even when taking damage, and will only break form when attacking or casting abilities. His first basic attack while in Ghost Wolf form will deal twice his normal damage. This trait gives Rehgar a significant advantage in combat, and is especially useful for letting him get close to enemies or to get away from them even while taking fire., This build focuses on maximizing Chain Heal so that it heals more health, heals more heroes at once and can be used more often. All you need to do is sit back in the rear, cast Chain Heal along with Lightning Shield on heroes that are being focused down by the enemy, and prevent the enemy from penetrating your formation by using Earthbind Totem near your allies. Only pick Cleanse if the enemy team has heroes with lengthy slows, roots or stuns (e.g. Murky, Thrall, Jaina, Malfurion etc.). A well-timed Cleanse can allow your allies to escape what would have been certain doom if they had been disabled all the way. Also, Storm Shield is generally the better pick for dealing with large burst damage, but Farseer’s Blessing is also competent if your enemies are focusing all their damage on a single player on your team.  Talent Build: Spiritwalker’s Grace > Chain Reaction > Earth Shield OR Cleanse > Ancestral Healing > Healing Surge > Tidal Waves > Storm Shield OR Farseer’s Blessing  , This build revolves around Lightning Shield and is best used if your team is lacking in damage due to the absence of hard-hitting assassins or if you already have a healer and your main warrior or melee assassin needs some extra damage to threaten the enemy ranks. Simply cast Lightning Shield on the melee heroes charging the front and follow it up with a timely Bloodlust to further improve their mobility and damage output. You can even join the fray when you get Lightning Bond since it automatically casts Lightning Shield on you as well - complete with all the benefits from the talents you chose.  Talent Build: Empowering Charge > Storm caller > Earth Shield > Bloodlust > Reactive Spark > Lightning Bond OR Earthgrasper Totem > Gladiator’s War Shout  , This build is all about boosting Earthbind Totem while giving you more mobility options to weave into and out of combat. Feral Lunge gives you the ability to close in faster to put down your Totem at a more optimal location, while the stealth from Shadow Wolf gives you the ability to get closer without alerting the enemy and then to disengage more easily once the enemy is hot on your trail. Rewind’s purpose is to allow you to put down two Earthbind Totems – which is a very real threat in large team fights where the enemy team is tightly clumped up and vulnerable to the Totem’s hefty slowing effects. Forward Momentum is the preferred choice since you’ll be joining the battle, but Earth Shield is a respectable choice as well if you have trouble managing the damage the enemy team throws your way.  Talent Build: Colossal Totem > Shadow Wolf > Forward Momentum OR Earth Shield > Bloodlust > Feral Lunge > Earthgrasp Totem > Rewind  ","['support melee heroes', 'use earthbind totem', 'use bloodlust', 'team', 'use ghost wolf', 'gap', 'enemy movement', 'controller', 'scout', 'use chain', 'healer', 'use lightning shield', 'advantage', 'shield', 'enemies', 'rescue allies', 'allies', 'damage', 'enemy formation', 'melee damage', 'use ancestral healing', 'team fights']"

You won’t. Easy answer. Sign up as follows:   Go to the main page of the Tumblr website. Click the sign-up button. This will redirect you to another screen with the email and password requirements, just like on every other site you visit. Enter a legit email address, and choose a unique URL. Try to pick a name that someone would be more likely to remember; don’t go and use a bunch of symbols – people won’t remember that. If it’s possible, pick something that is derived from another language, or is a play on words in your own. That way, it will be intriguing to other people, and they will be more inclined to inquire about it. Don’t worry though – if you think it’s crappy, you can always change it later.; , There will be a myriad of themes thrown at you at first; if you are overwhelmed, pick a basic one for now – as above, you can always change it later. Pick a theme that correlates with your own interests; if that means you have to make your own from scratch (although that takes skill in coding), so be it. This is an extra terrific idea, since if your blog catches on, people can request to use your theme.  , The most used and cliché thing you can hear about Tumblr is “make your posts unique!” Even though it’s not very unique to make them unique anymore, it’s still important. Even if you are trying to show off for other people, you are still the one making the posts and uploading the content. If all you do is repost, then not only will that tarnish your blogging rep, you’ll be as bland as a banana – and people will look right through that. As the wise How to Be Tumblr Famous puts it:  “You can make original text posts. This means writing meta about television shows or books, if that's your niche, or dissecting bad literature. It means putting your opinions and your ideas out there for people to see. That may seem scary, but, even if people don't agree with your ideas, they'll still be engaging you and then other people will see and be intrigued.”  , With the amazing feature of the queue, you can post even when you’re not around. Posting new, fresh, and original content is a must, no matter if you’re a scientist or a sociologist.  , Taking care of your body will become a breeze if you follow this simple rule. Chugging a one-liter of Coke and downing 25 pizza rolls after school every day won’t help you on your road to Tuml-boydom. Having a lean it fit body is essential.  , That means taking a shower every day, plus washing your face after school – especially if you are acne prone. Tumblr boys usually are devoid of acne, so get that treated first thing. There are so many products out there that there should be no reason for you to suffer through it.  , As there are so many products out there to help this, it’s unnecessary to sit and suffer through it. Here are some tips to help you out:   Wash your face twice a day with a cleanser. Force yourself to wash your face with a mild cleanser twice a day – no matter how you feel. This will be the first step in diminishing acne, and you’ll be able to see results. Exfoliate your skin. Most guys seem to think things like these are for sissies – and they’re right -- about sissies that have great skin! This is imperative that you do – exfoliation is next to cleanliness, you know. A mild exfoliate works to slough off your dead skin cells that conglomerate on the surface of your skin. There are many homemade solutions, as well as bought. Use products with benzoyl peroxide. Don’t waste your money on the more expensive brands like Proactiv – you can get the same result from going to your local drugstore and picking up a bottle of benzoyl peroxide for less than a fifth of the cost.Look for crèmes or lotions that contain 3% or less of benzoyl peroxide.Don’t forget the toner and the moisturizer. Use the toner after you cleanse, and the moisturizer after you’ve put everything on. Your skin will thank you!  , Many a boy exists who is too tired or lazy to take the time to do this. Don’t be a victim of the Tragedy of the Commons. Secure your future molars now with an insurance policy of two minutes in the bathroom.  , Get enough protein, gain some weight, and work out. To be a Tumblr boy, you need to have muscles. Failing that, abs. If you’re scrawny, buckle down, eat more and gain weight. Here is a great article on this.  ,   First up: hair. If he is black, it is usually shaven with only a little hair left; that usually looks best. If he is white, and doesn’t have über-curly hair, then he can do a lot. Many Tumblr boys do a faux-hawk, while others have a tousled look. Do what looks best to you; if you think bedhead is cool, go for it. Just make sure you have your Obey snap-back on. Face. His face is usually devoid of acne. Though, there are some that can own up to their acne (especially if they’ve had hard struggles with it) and make it their own – a signature of them. If you can do that – and pull it off – kudos to you. The earring of choice, if you do choose to wear one, is faux diamond. Shirt. Usually something ironic, hipster, or sport-related. Graphic sweatshirts are good, along with anything Hurley. Obey is fine, and tanks tops are a must. So are tacky sweaters and anything plaid. Hoodies are good, too. Pants. Skinny jeans are a staple, as are white skinny jeans. Sweatpants, if worn correctly, are an option, as are slim khakis. Shoes. Nike, Jordans, and Vans are the most popular. Any shoe will work really – no one will be seeing much of them anyway.  , Now that you walk the walk and talk the talk, you might want to post the post. That means, if you’re gonna start acting like a Tumblr boy, an official rule is to take oodles of selfies per day in your room. But you can’t do that if you don’t have the proper accommodations!  , Take photos from your adventures and escapades and print them and put them on your wall. That is one “strangely specific” aspect of Tumblr rooms that can be pin-pointed. This includes wall-murals, and “inspirational quotes.”  , Not only will this make your room cozier, it will look cooler, as well. Get creative––you don’t have to use Christmas lights if you don’t want to; there are many other options to choose from: LED, lava lamps, track lighting, and so forth.  , Because it clashes so horrible with your room, it is bound to make an impression.

"['acquire a power supply that will work for your computer', 'place your computer case on its side', 'open the computer case', 'mount the power supply', 'plug in the connectors', 'close your case', 'turn on your computer']",How to Install a Power Supply," The power supply is what powers all of the components inside of your computer. It will need to provide enough power so that all of the components can function properly. It will also need to have the correct connectors for your hardware.   Make sure that the wattage of the power supply is sufficient for the hardware you have installed. The CPU and the graphics card will draw the most power. If the power supply is not sending out enough power, your computer may run sluggishly or not at all. Modern hard drives and optical drives require SATA connectors for power. All modern power supplies have these connectors. Some of the more powerful video cards require two PCI-E connectors. Make sure that your power supply can accommodate everything that you need to connect. Some cases have non-standard housings for power supply. Ensure that the power supply you purchase will fit in the case. ATX cases should work with all ATX power supplies, and mATX cases will need a mATX power supply.; , Laying the case on its side will typically provide the best access to the power supply housing. If there is an existing power supply, make sure that it is unplugged before opening the case.  , In order to access the housing, you may need to remove some of your components, such as the CPU fan. This will depend on your case layout.  , Most housings allow you to slide the power supply in, and it will usually only fit one way. Make sure that any fans on the power supply are not blocked, and that you can screw it in from the back with all four screws. If you can’t, then the power supply may be inserted incorrectly.   Mount the power supply securely with all four screws before moving on. You can use standard ATX case screws if the power supply didn’t come with any.  , Once the power supply is secured, you can start wiring the interior of the computer. Take your time to ensure that no component is forgotten, and to place the wires in a way that doesn’t interfere with system fans or cooling. You will likely have more connectors that places to connect to; try to tuck these extra cables out of the way.   Connect the 20/24 pin connector to the motherboard. This is the largest connector on the power supply. Most modern motherboards require the 24-pin connector, while older motherboards will only use the first 20 pins. Some power supplies have a detachable 4-pin connector to make connecting old motherboards easier. Connect the 12V power to the motherboard. Older motherboards use a 4-pin connector, while newer ones use an 8-pin. This powers the processor, and should be clearly marked on the cable or in your power supply’s documentation. Connect your graphics card. Mid- and high-end graphics cards will require one or multiple 6- and 8-pin connectors. These will be marked as PCI-E connectors. Connect your drives. Most drives use SATA power connectors, which are thin plugs. If you have older drives, then you will need to connect via Molex connectors, which are 4 horizontal pins. There are adapters to turn Molex connectors into SATA for older power supplies.  , Once everything is connected, you can close of the case and plug your monitor and peripherals back in. Plug the power supply into the wall and ensure that the switch on the back is set to on.  , If everything is connected and powered properly, the fan on the power supply should turn on and your computer will boot like it normally would. If you hear a beep and nothing happens, then something inside is not connected correctly, or the power supply is not providing enough power to your components.","['computer', 'connectors', 'side', 'computer case', 'case', 'power supply']"

Knowing this information will make him or her easier to find. Because some combinations of first and last names are common, it's easier to narrow down if you have a middle name, too.   You can find a person's full name by looking through family documents if you have them. Try family bibles, baptismal records, or birth certificates. You can also try contacting the church if you know the person or family was connected to one church for a long time. Many churches keep baptismal records.; , If you don't know the date of death, you can try searching the obituaries of local newspapers where the person lived. You can usually find some information on the person in the obituary, such as the date of birth, the date of death, and the names of the person's parents and descendants. You may luck out and find the location of the grave, as well.If you only have a name, you can try searching national archives of newspapers. Often times, your local library will have access to these databases.If you can't find this information, some websites will accept a date range for the death date.The date of birth is also helpful to keep on hand if you have it, as it can narrow down results.  , If you're having no luck finding the date of death, try looking at city directories and even phone books. If the person is listed one year, but not the next, you can narrow down the year of death., The place of death is often included in the obituary. If you know the city and state, you can also look up the county, which some websites request when you are trying to find information.If you can get a copy of the death certificate, the place of death will also be listed on it.Try asking family members. Family members are a good source for this information, as they usually know where a person was living when she died. If no one knows, ask for old Bibles, as in the past, families used to record births and deaths in Bibles, including the place of death.Old letters can also be a good source of information. Also, newspaper clippings are often saved by family members, including obituaries. You can also try searching legal documents. For instance, probate records are often a good way to find out where a person died because many estates go into probate after death., If you're having trouble finding some of this information, the CDC lists the departments in each state that handle these kinds of records. You can request a copy of the death certificate from these departments, which will give you information such as the date of death and the cause of death. You will likely have to pay a fee for the copy of the death certificate.Depending on the state, you may need to prove you are a family member of the deceased because some states have closed vital records, which includes death certificates. For instance, Arizona, Oklahoma, and New Hampshire have closed vital records, though some exceptions are made for other types of applicants, such as genealogists and people from oil and gas and mineral companies. You will need to provide proof of your relationship to the deceased, using items such as court documents, marriage certificates, and birth certificates.Some states have open vital records, such as Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts, though a few of these states limit the record the public can see, such as only providing the cause of death.  , This file is also known as the Death Index. You do have to pay to make inquiries through the National Technical Information Service. You can pay per inquiry, which as of 2015 is $10 an inquiry.This index will provide you with basic information about the person, such as the date death and place of death. Some websites offer limited access to this information for free, such as Genealogy Bank. You will have to create a free account to access the information., If you have the Social Security number of the person, keep it on hand. While it is difficult to find the number if you don't have it, it can make searching easier if you do.","['copy', 'census records', 'place', 'city', 'social security number', 'death', 'state', 'date', 'person', 'social security administration', 'master death file', 'death certificate', 'full name', 'ssa']"
"['focus on the moment at hand', 'put your phone away', 'help the host or hostess', 'interact with more people by moving around', 'initiate a fun activity', 'put yourself out there and be part of the party']",How to Be the Life of a High School Party2," At large parties with a lot going on, it can get overwhelming and your natural reaction might be to space out. Trying to pay attention to everything means paying attention to nothing. Actively fight this tendency. Be in the moment you are in, and find a way to shut out all the other people besides the ones you are specifically with.If you go through the whole party trying to focus on everything that is going on, you won’t actually experience any of it directly. Allow yourself to forget about all the extra stuff that’s around you and enjoy the thing you are currently doing. Once you find someone and are hanging out with them, don’t look around the rest of the room to see what everyone else is doing. Pay attention to only what you are doing, at least for a while.  , It’s a good idea to have your phone, and you can even check it periodically, but don’t spend the whole night looking at the screen. You can watch your phone sitting at home alone, but you don’t always get to be out with people doing stuff. Rather than thinking of all the other stuff you could be doing, enjoy the party you are at.   Plus, if the party is rowdy at all, there’s always the chance you could lose or break your phone and you don’t want to do that.  , With people all over the place and the host or hostess often busy keeping things going, offer to help them out by getting people food, refilling the punch bowl, or keeping tabs on the music situation.   If there is an iPod or something playing, see if you can play DJ for a while and pick the jams for everyone to dance to.  , Bigger parties tend to span across multiple rooms and could even include the porch, patio, or the back yard. Making sure that you move throughout the various spaces of the party will increase the number of people that see you there. This gives you the opportunity to interact with as many people as possible rather than just those in one spot.If you have been in one place for a while, mention that you are going to check out another room or go outside. You can specifically mention someone that you want to go talk to, or you can say you are going for food or a drink. The people who you are talking with will be less likely to think you are just ditching them. They may even think that you are more important because you have other people you plan to see. It may feel more comfortable to stick with the location and group of people that you already secured, but being the life of the party means being seen by more people. Later on, the guests will most likely not remember the person who sat on the couch the whole time, but they will remember someone who they saw moving throughout the entire party the whole night.  , High school parties can range from everyone kind of standing around trying to figure out what to do, to everyone being really drunk and acting crazy. You have to take stock of which one you are at, but starting something fun can be adapted to either one. You could lead in getting people dancing, get people to jump in the pool, start a game of truth or dare, or form an arm wrestling competition.People want to have fun at parties, and while that may involve just drinking and hanging out, a lot of people also want something active to do. If you start up a fun trend that everyone ends up getting really into, you’ll be looked at as someone who is fun to have around. This may seem a little risky and it may take a little extra courage, but the payoff of getting people to have more fun can really be worth it.  , The most important thing to remember is that parties are meant to be a fun place to let off some steam and let yourself de-stress. So you don’t want to get so focused on being the life of the party that you end up not having any fun. Be yourself, but push yourself just a little farther than usual.If people are dancing, dance. If there is karaoke going down, hop up on stage. People will probably not remember the party guests who sat on the sofa the whole time, but they will remember those who were involved in the happenings. Don’t try to be someone that you aren’t, but take the opportunity to step out of your comfort zone. Say yes to things you normally wouldn’t (but still be responsible).

"['fill the container with warm water', 'get ready to mix', 'add the gelatin', 'scoop off foam and bubbles', 'cool the gelatin', 'extract the gel', 'cut the gel', 'shoot the block', 'take photos']",How to Make Ballistics Gel3," Fill the mold to the line drawn earlier using warm tap water. Ideally, the temperature should be around 105 °F (41 °C). Use a thermometer to maintain a good average temperature.   Making gelatin takes longer with warm water as opposed to hot, but results in a clearer final product.  , The mixing process will take a significant amount of time, so make sure that you can comfortably mix for about twenty minutes. You’ll want to mix with a large spoon, wooden or metal.  , Use a 1-cup measuring cup to slowly add gelatin to the water. You need to be stirring constantly to avoid clumping. Add all of the gelatin over the course of about 10 minutes, sprinkling one cup at a time.   This step is much easier with two people. One person stirs, while the other slowly adds the gelatin. After the gelatin has been added, you can swap stirring duties to give your arm a break. To improve the clarity, you can add cinnamon oil to the gelatin. You will need about 9 drops; 1 drop per gallon of water. Add the cinnamon oil about halfway through the stirring process.  , After the stirring is complete, there will be a little bit of foam on the top of the mixture. Gently scoops this out and discard. There should be no visible foam or clumps of undissolved gelatin in the final mix.  , You want to cool the mixture to about 36 °F (2 °C). Avoid freezing it, or else the blocks will become too cloudy. If you don’t get it cool enough, the gel will not get as dense as it needs to. Cool the gel for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.  , Once the gel has fully cooled, gently turn the container over onto a clean flat surface such as a kitchen counter. Slowly guide the gel out of the container with your hands to help avoid cracking the block.  , Use a large kitchen knife to cut the block into two halves. Cut the long way so that you are left with two narrow blocks with the dimensions 6 x 6 x 20. Gently wrap each block completely in plastic wrap. This will prevent evaporation, which will affect the density and integrity of the block.   After wrapping the block, place a stiff piece of cardboard on each block and wrap it again. The cardboard will make transporting the block much easier. Store the blocks at 40 °F (4 °C) or cooler until you are ready to shoot them. Transport the blocks in a cooler to help keep them at optimum density.  , Place the blocks on a stable flat surface. A piece of plywood on sawhorses will work. Adjust the blocks so that you shoot into a 6 x 6 square end. If you are firing a high-powered gun, place a cement block behind the ballistics gel to keep the force from knocking the block off of the platform.   Always follow proper safety procedures when handling fierarms. Be careful unwrapping the gel, you don’t want it to crack just before you shoot it. Ballistics gel is typically shot from about 10 feet (3.0 m) out. There are three standard tests: Naked – nothing covering the block. Lightly clothed – two t-shirts covering the block. Heavily clothed – two t-shirts and two pairs of jeans covering the block.  , If you want to take photos of the results, paint the plywood that you placed the blocks on white. This will highlight the bullet fragments. You will be able to see the results best in bright sunlight.  ","['container', 'gelatin', 'block', 'foam', 'photos', 'bubbles', 'warm water', 'gel']"
"['gather your materials', 'prepare the area for installation', 'mark the top level line', 'mark the studs and utility lines', 'plan out your spacing', 'attach your panels', 'attach your top rail', 'attach your stiles', 'attach your baseboard and shoe molding', 'add finishing touches']",How to Install Wainscoting2," You'll need 1/4"" plywood for the back panels, 1x4 lumber for the stiles, 1x6 lumber for the baseboard, and 1x2 lumber for the rails. You'll need to rent a circular saw from your local big box hardware store to cut the lumber and panels to size. A laser lever, scrap wood for stile spacing, stud finder, pneumatic nail gun with 2.5"" and 1.5"" finishing nails, and other tools can also be helpful. , Remove existing baseboards, chair rails or skirt moldings. You should also remove outlet plates. Measure the linear footage of the room or wall with a tape measure in order to determine how much wood you will need.   Allow wood to acclimate in the room where it will be installed for at least 48 hours. This will prevent expansion and contraction of the paneling from occurring after installation.  , Establish a level line around the room for the top of the panels. Measure the height of the room, divide that by 3, and create your panels to reach that height or close to it. Once you've calculated the height, draw and then mark (with painter's tape works best) a level line around the room. A laser level will make this easiest.   You may want to try to place the top edge of the panel just a little higher than the panel really is if you know that your floor is uneven. This will keep down the amount of trimming you need to do. Shoe molding can always be placed at the bottom to hide gaps that occur with an uneven floor.  , Use a stud finder tool, or gently tap the wall with a hammer, to locate the wall studs and mark them just above the level line. If you can locate the utility lines, you should mark those on the wall as well, to help avoid hitting them with nails.   Utility lines are often found around water sources or immediately next to the studs closest to outlets and wall lights. Be careful when nailing in these areas.  , The size and orientation of your room will determine what your paneling looks like, so specific measurements unfortunately cannot be given. There are a few basic guidelines you should follow though, in order to figure out where everything should go:   Try to get at least a few stiles placed over a stud. This will help seal your panel to the wall. Don't place a stile over an outlet or other unusual feature. This will only create more cutting and measuring for you. Try to line up your stiles to cover gaps between panels, helping to hide the seam. Set the spacing of your stiles in a way that looks good for the size of room you have. The smaller the room, the further apart the stiles should be. Larger rooms can be spaced the same as studs: 16"" center-to-center.  , Add construction adhesive to the backs of the panels and place them on the wall, staring at the corner and covering the longest wall first. Line the top of the panel up with your level line and secure the panels into the studs with a pneumatic nail gun and 1.5"" finish nails (should be placed at the top and bottom, so that they will be hidden by the rail and baseboard). Go around the room until all of the panels are placed.   You will need to cut a hole for an outlet when you see that a panel will cover one. Cover the outlet in brightly colored chalk, line up the panel, press the panel into the chalk to get your outline, and then cut out the shape with a jigsaw.  , Line up the 1x2 rails so that they are flush with the top of the panels and then nail them into place with 2.5"" finish nails. These should also be nailed into studs whenever possible.  , Next, glue and nail the stiles in place exactly how you attached the top rail. Start with two stiles at the corner of the room, and then use the spacer at the top and then again at the bottom as you nail the two ends into place. Use a carefully cut piece of scrap wood as a spacer and a laser or normal level to make sure the stiles are nailed in as straight as possible.  , Next attach the baseboard the same way you attach the the stiles and top rail. Don't worry about any gaps left at the bottom by uneven floors: that will be covered up by shoe molding which goes up last.   You can also add molding at the top to cover uneven rails and paneling or just use a flat piece if you want a usable ledge.  , Sand the completed wood surface, cover any nails with a nail crayon, and then paint or stain the wood as desired. Enjoy your new wainscoting!  ","['studs', 'stiles', 'area', 'installation', 'panels', 'top rail', 'touches', 'utility lines', 'baseboard', 'shoe molding', 'materials', 'top level line', 'spacing']"
"['encourage activity', 'help increase her self-esteem', ""don't lecture"", 'be patient', 'suggest reading', 'consider a journal']",How to Help Someone Who You Think Is Cutting Themselves2," Try to encourage your loved one to be as active as possible. When she feels disturbed or has the urge to cut herself, she needs to find a more positive, active outlet to let it out. Suggest doing rigorous exercise, such as running, dancing, aerobics, swimming, tennis, or kick boxing. These can provide an outlet for all of her sadness, aggression, or unhealthy emotion that leads to cutting. Offer to join your friend and exercise together.   To help calm the mind, she can also try yoga, meditation, or tai chi. These exercises can help her get a new lease on life, with a fresh, energetic, confident approach that will help her not want to cut herself. Exercise also releases endorphins into her body, which are the chemicals in the body that makes her feel good.When a person cuts himself, endorphins rush to the area of the cut and are released into the blood stream, which cause feelings of relaxation, happiness, and relief. Exercise provides her with a positive way to release endorphins instead., Low self-esteem is one reason that drives a person to cut. You need to help her understand that cutting will not and cannot improve her self-image but accomplishments and achievements will. Help her prove to herself that she is amazing and full of accomplishments. This can be through her studies, work, friends, or volunteering. When she becomes aware of her accomplishments, her self-esteem will go up and she will feel better about herself. This should lead her to not want to cut herself.You can help your friend realize she is full of accomplishments by sharing with her a list of her positive attributes and accomplishments.  , Pandering to her will not make her want to change her self-harming behavior. Do not try to drill the person with lectures and sermons that go on for a long time. Keep your talks small and simple. Let the person take in and digest whatever it is you told her. Give her the time to contemplate.   Have your small pep talks at a location that is pleasant, peaceful, in the midst of nature, away from hustle and bustle, and private, where the chances of being bothered are minimal. If you can't go somewhere in nature, try a quiet place in your apartment or house or a secluded study room at your local library. The exact location doesn't matter as long as it's a place where you can an honest, uninterrupted conversation. Give her ample time to talk to you. Give her the time she needs and wants. Do not push her into speeding things up and always choose a place and time that she is comfortable with.  , Your loved one will not stop cutting overnight or because you tell her to. For her, this is the way she knows how to deal with her feelings. Telling her to stop the behavior immediately may terrify her because she might have got so used to this coping mechanism and feel lost in the absence of an alternative coping skill. This can also make it worse for her, since you are trying to take away her coping mechanism for her pain and trauma. Be patient and accept that it will take time. Don't get discouraged and take your time helping her.Issuing ultimatums without assisting or supporting her in ways to find safe alternative is not a wise option and can cause more harm than good., People who cut themselves are apprehensive of socializing because they may face suspicious looks and unanswerable probing from others. In order to take her mind off cutting and avoid uncomfortable social situations, suggest she read more. Books open up new horizons. She can travel beyond the four walls of her room without really going out. She can also learn that there are innumerable ways various people have dealt with tough times and experiences.   Books also provide an opportunity to understand that there can be plenty of positive and acceptable coping strategies. Present her with books that are thought provoking, such as those that will help her look within herself and assess her personal predicament.  , A great way to help your loved one come to terms with her cutting is through journaling. Tell her to maintain a daily journal that she puts all of her thoughts, anguish, pain, and joy into. Writing can take away the pain and leave her light and relieved. Tell her to write about anything that comes to mind.   Don't advise her to write specifically about cutting unless she goes to a therapist or counselor. You never know what can of worms could open up, so suggesting your friend focus on a problematic behavior that could be compensating for that trauma is not a good idea unless she goes to a professional for help. A journal can also help a psychologist, psychiatrist, or counselor learn about her condition before diagnosis and treatment.","['journal', 'self-esteem', 'reading', 'patient', 'activity']"

Whenever you're attempting to be annoying, make an effort to keep your speaking voice loud. Try to stay clear of outright screaming, however, as it's not sustainable. To truly annoy someone, you need to keep your irritating habits up for a while.   If you don't want to get in trouble, you should gauge what your parents (or other authority figures) will think of your loud volume. Although you may be trying to annoy your older brother specifically, there's a good chance you may end up annoying others in the process. For a boost to your volume, try speaking directly into your brother's ear. The invasion of personal space can be a great annoyance tactic in of itself.; , If you're trying to be annoying, you should put this research to the test. If you performed well on a test at school, you should talk his ear off about it. If you like a certain trait about yourself, you should make an effort to brag about it at every twist and turn.   If you brag to your parents about things you've accomplished, it might make you look better in their eyes. This technique is best used in tandem with a loud volume. Unless your brother has wits of iron, this technique alone should start to show cracks in his psyche.  , Stress and annoyance is affected by someone's ability to cope with their current mood and workload.If your brother is carefree, it will take a lot more to annoy him than if he's already at his wit's end. Try to look for signs that he's feeling stressed:   He's already irritable and prone to anger. You know he's really busy with work or school. You've seen him react badly to everyday things.  , Question-asking is a vital part of conversation in mild doses, but if you constantly ask questions that have little relevance to the conversation at hand, it tends to get annoying fast. If you and your brother are having a conversation, you should make an effort to turn your talk into a sequence of questions about things of little value. Ask him how his day was, then proceed to interrogate him about the smallest parts of his day. How was the sandwich he ate for lunch earlier that day? Was the seat on the bus ride home plushy enough for his likings? These questions are usually worthless, but being bombarded by them will get the proper response out of him.   If you want to get meta with your annoying questions, you might ask him ""What is it that annoys you most?"" If he's gullible enough to answer you honestly, you should put that new information to good use.  , If you heard something juicy about a friend of yours, you should start rambling senselessly about it. It's fine if your brother doesn't know anything about the people you're gossiping about; to him, it'll just make your banter seem al the more pointless.   Gossiping isn't so likely to get you in trouble with parents if they don't know the people, but you do run the risk of getting into trouble with others if they find out you've ben talking about them behind their backs. This is especially worthwhile if you know the people your brother is friends with. People get annoyed fast if they hear people they care about being discussed in a bad light.  , Even if a joke is good in the first place, it can be transformed in an evil weapon of annoyance if it's repeated enough times.The same goes for stories, catchphrases or questions. Repeating things has a cumulative effect: The more you repeat something, the more annoying it becomes.   With the right kind of determination, you can drive an older brother crazy simply by repeating a single catchphrase.  , One common way young people annoy their older siblings is through making themselves out to look like the superior child in a family. This can be done through overachieving in school, work, creative endeavours (like music) or social magnetism (like popularity.) Try to keep in mind whenever your parents are watching you, and do your best to excel in whatever ways you can. By contrast, your older brother may look less successful, and this by itself will be annoying to him.   Although no one likes a brown noser, most parents love to see their child trying to impress them somehow. Keep in mind that making yourself look like the best is not necessarily compatible with being annoying in more obnoxious ways. On its own however, it's incredibly annoying.  , It is natural for children to keep a level of privacy from their parents. As a relative peer of your older brother, you have a potentially greater insight into what your brother's personal and social life looks like. By ""innocently"" telling your parents about whatever's going on in your brother's life, the broken privacy will annoy him to no end. What's better, there's a level of plausible deniability in doing this. If your brother tries to get angry with you about this, you can pretend like you were simply telling your parents out of admiration for your sibling.  , Exclaiming something outrageous in public turns every bystander into fuel for your brother's annoyance. If you and your brother are out in public together, acting obnoxious can embarrass and irritate your brother via association. Venues like the shopping mall or a library can be great for shouting matches. If being annoying by association doesn't seem like enough, you can turn the embarrassment directly on him by accusing him of something ridiculous.   For example, if your brother is a very sombre person, you can scream at the top of your lungs in public: ""Why do you wear that obnoxious clown costume to bed every night?"" The weirdness of a statement like that will get everyone's attention, and your brother won't have anything to say in response to it. Make sure your parents aren't with you when you make a scene. If they are, you'll make them feel even more embarrassed than your brother. This will almost undoubtedly get you into trouble. You should also do a quick scan to make sure no one is watching that might report the scene to your parents.  , Pranks come in all shapes and sizes. The mild irritation of a prank is often combined with the social embarrassment it causes. This makes pranks a fairly heavy weapon in your arsenal. Try placing a whoopee cushion on his seat before he sits down for dinner. Better still, put salt in his beverage. Pranks more better if other people are in on the joke as well. It's important to make sure you don't tell anyone who might spill the beans to your brother. If this happens, you may run the risk of having the prank backfiring on you.   Purely embarrassing pranks are good if you don't want to get in trouble. The emotional annoyance of being embarrassed is hard to measure for someone else. This makes it perfect if you're trying not to get in trouble. Make sure there isn't any material damage. You can slip away without getting in trouble for relatively ""harmless"" pranks, but parents are much more likely to get you in trouble if there's lasting damage. You get bonus points if everyone else thinks its funny. The laughter will help embarrass your brother even further.  , Comment on all of his posts, and start sending messages to people he is friends with online. Intruding yourself on his social life is a quick way to get your brother annoyed.   If your parents are also on social media, it's a good idea to keep your posts innocuous and pleasant. Going out of your way to be annoying or crude will get on their radar, but a sickly-sweet tone might be seen by them as one sibling trying to bond with another.  , Music is a great way to annoy someone, especially if your tastes in music differ. If your rooms are next to each other, try blasting music while he's trying to sleep or study. It helps if you know in advance that he hates the music you're putting on.   Keep in mind that this runs the risk of you getting into trouble with your family. Keep your parents' tolerance in mind, or save this for when they're not around.  , A shower is a great opportunity to simultaneously test the limits of your vocal cords and your family's patience. If you know your brother is nearby, try belting out the most obnoxious song you can think of. Whatever's charting on a Top 40 list is a great place to start with if you're unsure what to sing.  , Farting, sneezing, burping and cracking your knuckles are all but a few of the tools your body offers you when it comes to being annoying. Gross-out humour using your body can turn an older sibling off his dinner, or distract him from his studying while he's trying to focus. If you try this, you should consider what tolerance for rudeness other members of your family have. You should only try to annoy one person at a time. If you're doing this with family around, you should be reasonably sure your brother will be the only one that objects.   If you're not usually a gassy type, eating a healthy dose of beans will get you on the right track.  , A messy environment will get on a lot of peoples' nerves without them sometimes even realizing it. If your brother is a neat freak and likes to keep things tidy, making an intentional mess of areas he's usually in will put him on edge. Although a mess may not be enough to annoy your brother on its own, it does have the effect of making him more sensitive to other irritating activities.   This may be more annoying to your parents than your brother. After all, it's their place. If you do make a mess, you should try to clean up before they notice. If you think you can manage it, try going into his room and messing things up a little bit.  ,, Part of annoying someone means not taking it too far. Annoyance does not include bullying or being truly mean-spirited. At the end of the day, you should make sure you and your brother's relationship is okay., Annoying someone directly is one thing, but embarrassing him in front of his friends can result in potentially serious damage to his relationships. If you accidentally take something to that point, it's a good idea to stop while you're ahead. Apologize to him, and offer to make it up somehow.   If you manage to get in trouble with your parents, making amends with your brother will be a good way of easing the consequences on your end. Buying your brother lunch is a good way to make up if you go too far.

Once you have mastered this process, do so with your non-dominant hand. As you practice this, switch back and forth from hand to hand. Now you can then go to a one handed cradling.  , This is done just as you would throw a ball. Raise your non-throwing arm up to point where you throw. Raise your throwing arm up.

So running is a big part of the game. Being in shape and fit is crucial to the game. When it comes to strength training, upper body workouts are very important for shot speed. Core work is vital for shots and defense.  , Once you have the fundamentals down, you can start playing on teams.   Once you are on a team, you should practice your fundamentals. The team that wins is the team that can pass and catch the ball, and who can scoop a groundball. It is important to keep improving your skills. Once you get to high school, try out for your school's Girl's Lacrosse team. The main goal is for you to make it onto the team. Two important side pieces will be your grades and staying out of trouble. Remember that you are always a representative of your school and community. Depending on how good your high school team is, the greater the honor to be a freshman that makes varsity.  , This will provide you greater experience and interaction with other girls you may play with or against in high school.  , They can teach you new things that you haven't learned before.

"['properly secure the animal to apply the tag', ""identify the tagging site on the animal's ear"", 'keep the applicator clean to prevent infection', 'place each half of the tag or button onto the applicator', 'check the alignment of the tagger', 'position the applicator in the identified tagging site on the animals ear', 'examine the tag', 'repeat for the other ear', 'let the animal go']",How to Tag Cattle," Movement of the animal's head could create an undesirable situation when trying to properly apply a tag or button. This could result in injury to either the person or animal or both, and may also result in improper tagging of the animal.   For cattle the best equipment to use is a chute with a head gate, or even a squeeze chute. Place a halter, and/or nose lead or ring on the animal and tie the lead rope to the side of the head gate tight enough so that it impedes the animal to move its head as you apply the tag or button. For young calves, a head gate is not needed. Simply putting the calf on its side by bending over the calf, grabbing the flank and neck and hoisting it onto its side, then pinning it with your knee on its neck is sufficient when tagging it.  Tagging should be left for last when you have the calf on the ground, since the applicator often will cause a calf to become a bit more vocal than you like, particularly when its momma is close at hand.  ; , Tags should be applied in the middle third of the ear between the upper and lower ribs. It is important, when using electronic identification (EID) or Radio-Frequency identification (RFID) tags or buttons, to apply the visual panel or male portion on the outside-back part of the ear and the button or tag, which is the female portion, on the inside of the ear.   Also make sure that the last few digits of visual panel matches with the digits on the button or tag.  , Use rubbing alcohol or a disinfectant solution to clean the jaw and pin portion of the applicator before and after use. You should also clean the tagging area of the animal's ear.  , The visual panel stud must be inserted completely onto the applicator pin and the panel/button portion placed under the opposite clip.   Often a new tagger applicator will have a sticker or indentation on that tagger telling which end is which when placing the parts of the tag on. If not, the best rule of thumb to go by is that the point part goes over the pin and the tag or button on the other end. Also make sure the front of the tag or pin is facing away from the male end of the stud, not towards it. Thus is much easier to remember if you have bought tags that already have a bar-code and number on them.  , This must be done before you tag. Simply close the jaw of the applicator to the point where to the two halves just meet. The stud should be in line with the hole of the button or tag.  , Firmly and quickly close the applicator and release. You will hear a loud click when the stud goes completely into the hole, and upon releasing the tagger the tag or button will have stayed in place.  , This is to verify that it's correctly, comfortably, and securely positioned. Once satisfied, you may want to record the number of that particular animal for future reference.  , Quite often a producer will need to have a button in one ear and a tag in the other. Some will go as far as placing one tag in each ear. Regardless, you have the option to put in as many tags or buttons as you feel necessary.  , Once the tag or button is in, it should stay there for years to come. Note that buttons tend to last longer than tags.  ","['tag', 'ear', 'tagger', 'animal', 'applicator', 'animals ear', 'site', 'alignment', 'button', 'half', 'infection']"

If you have an existing account, simply log in.; , Twitch can be purchased with RP or IP, if you don't have enough of either you'll need to play continually until you have have enough IP or you will need to purchase enough RP to buy Twitch.   Once you purchase Twitch, you may also purchase skins to change the look of Twitch.  , Twitches abilities are Deadly venom, Ambush, Venom cask, Expunge and Spray and Pray. A description of each is down below :Deadly Venom (twitches basic ability): Twitch's basic attacks apply a stack of Deadly Venom, dealing 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 true damage per second for 6 seconds. This effect can stack up to 6 times for a minimum of 12 / 24 / 36 / 48 and maximum of 72 / 144 / 216 / 288 total true damage over the duration. Ambush:For 1.25 seconds, Twitch attempts to enter stealth, which may be delayed by up to 3 seconds if he takes damage before he goes invisible. While in stealth, Twitch gains 20% bonus movement speed. When Twitch unstealths, he gains bonus attack speed for 5 seconds. Casting spells or attacking will end his stealth prematurely. Venom cask: Twitch hurls a cask of venom at an area, infecting struck enemies with 2 stacks of Deadly Venom and slowing them for 3 seconds. Contaminate: Twitch expunges all nearby enemies afflicted by Deadly Venom, dealing physical damage equal to a base amount plus bonus damage for each stack of Deadly Venom on an enemy. Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat: For 7 seconds, Twitch gains bonus attack damage and 300 attack range. Additionally, each of his basic attacks will pierce enemies in an 850 length line, with each unit struck reducing the attack's damage by 20% down to a minimum of 40% damage.  , Select your runes, masteries, champion skin and summoner spells. Summer spells are chosen in regards to your playstyle preference, though a Flash spell can be useful when getting one last hit on fleeing enemies or as an emergency escape tool.  , Twitch's ability to go invisible can be used when ganking (ambushing) enemies and can also be used as an escape tool.   As ambush provides an additional attack speed boost once you leave invisibility, it can be useful when taking down turrets, however, being pushed far into your lane with Ambush on cooldown could leave you very vulnerable if ganked by an enemy.  , This can be achieved by getting continuous hits on an enemy. Once you have achieved the maximum stack of passive damage dealt by Deadly Venom, use the Venom Cask to slow the enemy so that an additional chance to deal damage is made.  , Due to Twitch having one of the highest attack speeds out of all of the champions, buy items in the shop that provide additional passive boosts upon hits that will add to the damage dealt by Deadly Venom.  , Contaminate has a high radius and will deal a significant amount of damage to all enemies affected by Deadly Venom.   If you get an enemies champion's health down quite low and they are still being affected by Deadly Venom then use Contaminate to finish them off on their retreat.  , Due to Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat's ability to pierce multiple enemies, higher range, higher damage and long cool down time, it's important to time it effectively. Aim to only use Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat when there are multiple enemies present or use it to finish off a retreating enemy(s).  , Try to buy items that increase attack damage and on-hit damage boosts and tailor them to your own playing style. An alternative could be to increase movement speed and attack speed with your Ambush ability to ""run and gun"" around the map (also useful for taking down turrets).   A great item to purchase to rapidly farm and aggressively push in your lane is Runaan's Hurricane. It fires out two extra ranged bolts and also applied on hit effects, utilizing your passive skill. However, this item may lose some of its usefulness when playing in PVP mode due to Twitches high damage output usually being required by your team (so a more single target damage focus build is needed). The Infinity Edge grants 250% critical damage. Pairing this with your ultimate ability (Rat-Ta-Tat-Tat) will inflict massive damage and will give your team an upper hand when in team fights.

"['do squats', 'do lunges', 'do leg raises', 'do kickbacks', 'do bridges', 'do lateral step-ups', 'do deadlifts', 'do some butt-toning aerobic exercise', 'do push-ups', 'do t-planks', 'do chest presses', 'do chest flys', 'do elbow squeezes', 'do pilates or yoga']",How to Exercise for Firmer Boobs and Butts," Squats are your number one go-to exercise if you're looking for a firmer butt and thighs. To perform a squat correctly:          Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Either stretch out your arms straight in front of you or maintain them in a controlled position near your chest. Lower your butt towards the floor, as if you were about to sit down on a chair. Aim to get your thighs parallel with the floor, but don't allow your knees to extend over your toes. Keep your back straight and your head up as you perform this exercise, and try to distribute your weight equally between your two feet. Slowly return back to the starting position, then continue for eight to 10 repetitions.; , Lunges are another great exercise for getting your gluteus maximus in shape. To perform them correctly:          Stand up straight, then take a large step forward with your right leg. Bend both of your knees until they form right angles. Don't allow your right knee to extend over your toes, or allow your left knee to touch the floor. As you lunge, keep your back straight and your head up. Also try to keep your stomach muscles contracted as you lunge to work your abs. Slowly step back to a standing position, then repeat — this time stepping forward with the left leg. Keep going until you have completed 10 repetitions with each leg., Leg raises are performed while lying on your side. They are an effective exercise as they allow you to work your butt and lower back simultaneously. To perform leg raises correctly:          Lie on your right side, propping your head up with your right elbow. If desired, bend your right knee but keep your left leg straight and in line with your back. Keeping your foot parallel with the ground, raise your left leg as high as you can, without moving your hips. You can use your left hand to support your hips and prevent them from tilting backwards. Squeeze your butt muscles as you lift your leg and try to keep your abdominals firm. Slowly lower your leg back to the starting position, then repeat eight to 10 more times before switching to the other leg. You can wear ankle weights around your knees to increase the resistance and make this exercise more challenging.  , One-leg kickbacks allow you to work your butt, while also helping you to strengthen your lower back. To perform correctly:          Get down on all fours, with your hands aligned beneath your shoulder and your knees aligned beneath your hips. Keeping your knee at a 90 degree angle, lift your right leg as high as possible behind you. Contract the muscles in your butt as you lift. Keep your neck in line with your spine as you perform the exercise — don't try to raise your head. Also try to avoid arching your spine as you lift your leg. Lower your leg back to the starting position and continue for eight to 10 repetitions. Then repeat with your left leg. If you want a more intense exercise, try to keep your leg straight as you lift instead of bending the knee or add ankle weights to increase the resistance.  , Bridges are very easy exercises to do, but produce great results! No butt-toning routine would be complete without them! To perform:          Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet approximately shoulder-width apart. Your heels should practically be touching your butt and your palms should be pressed down to the floor. Lift your hips off the ground while tightly squeezing your butt muscles and sucking in your tummy. Lift until your body forms a straight, diagonal line from your knees to your shoulders. Tuck your chin slightly as you lift and remember that the lift should come from your butt muscles, not your hamstrings. Slowly lower your butt back to the ground, then continue for eight to 10 repetitions.  , Lateral step-ups are another easy, yet effective exercise for toning your butt. To perform them, you will need a step bench and a set of 5 pound dumbbells (though these are optional).   Stand to the right of the step bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand (if using), in front of your thighs. With your right foot, take a sideways step onto the step bench and hold your left leg straight in mid-air. Hold this position for a count of three, squeezing in your butt muscles the entire time. Step back to the starting position and repeat the exercise 10 to 15 more times, before switching to the other leg., Deadlifts are a great total-body exercise, but they are particularly good for toning the glutes and hamstrings. You will need a set of dumbbells for this exercise — 5 pound ones will do, but 10 to 15 pounds will provide a more intense workout. To perform dumbbell deadlifts:   Place the dumbbells on the floor in front of you and stand up straight with your feet hip-width apart. Now, squat down towards the floor (as described above), keeping your head and chest up. Grab the two dumbbells simultaneously, using an overhand grip. Make sure your arms are completely straight and that your back is not rounded. Slowly raise yourself back to a standing position by straightening your legs and contracting your butt muscles. Thrust your shoulders back and your hips forward. Hinge forward at the hips, bending your knees very slightly, and bring the dumbbells as close to the floor as you can without any pain or discomfort in your back. Still holding the dumbbells, hinge back up to an upright position. Contract your abdominal muscles and buttocks. Repeat the exercise 10 to 15 more times.  , Getting a firm, toned butt is not all about stretching and weight exercises — you can can incorporate some glute work into your regular cardio workout too!   Step aerobics will improve the shape of your booty. Look for a class at your gym or get your own step and watch a video at home.Uphill walking/jogging/running will provide the best workout for your butt and thighs, so hit the great outdoors and do some hiking. If you're not the outdoorsy-type, switch to using the trainer at the gym, or set the treadmill to a steeper incline than normal. Other machines you can use are the elliptical and the exercise bike, as these provide great cardio workouts while also helping to firm and tone your butt and legs. Just remember — working out for short periods of time on high resistance builds muscle, while working out for longer periods of time on lower resistance tones.  , Push-ups are a great chest exercise which will help to produce firmer pectoral, arm and shoulder muscles. To perform correctly:   Get into a plank position, with your hands slightly more than shoulder-width apart and your legs resting on the balls of your feet. Slowly lower yourself down to the ground by bending your elbows. Remember to keep your back straight and your stomach muscles sucked in. Raise yourself back up to the plank position, then continue for 15 to 20 more repetitions. If this exercise is too challenging, you can modify it by balancing on your knees instead of the balls of your feet., This exercise will help to stretch out your chest and build muscle, while also toning your arms. You will need a set of 5 to 10 pound dumbbells. To perform this exercise correctly:   Take a dumbbell in each hand and get your body into a push-up position (you will be resting on the dumbbells). Place your feet just over a hip-width apart, as this will provide more stability. Lift your right hand straight up into the air, twisting your torso and turning your chest and upper body to one side. Stack your arm above your shoulder and keep your hips in place — the movement should be in your torso and upper body only. Your body should be forming a ""T"" shape. Return to the starting position, then repeat with the left arm. Continue until you have completed 10 repetitions with each arm.  , Chest presses will firm and tone the pectorals, while also working the arms. You will need a set of 5 to 10 pound dumbbells for this exercise.   Lie on your back on the ground or on an exercise bench, holding a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing away from you. Bend your elbows so your arms form a 90 degree angle, keeping your upper arms parallel with your shoulders. Slowly extend your arms, stretching them towards the ceiling, directly above your chest. Slowly bring your arms back to the starting position, then continue for 15 to 20 repetitions.  , The chest fly exercise builds muscle in the chest. You will need a set of 5 to 10 pound dumbbells for this exercise.   Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and open your arms wide, almost parallel with your shoulders. Raise your arms, palms facing towards each other, until your hands almost meet above your chest. Imagine you are giving someone a bear hug! Slowly lower your arms back to the starting position, then repeat 15 to 20 more times., This is a simple exercise that works out the chest muscles. You will need dumbbells again for this exercise.   Stand up straight and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Raise the weight up to eye level and bend your elbows so they form 90 degree angles. Imagine your arms as football goalposts. Draw your elbows towards each other, keeping your arms parallel. Don't allow the weight to drop past eye level. Open your elbows wide again, returning to starting position. Continue for 15 to 20 more repetitions., These exercises won't do much to physically change your shape, but they can help improve your posture, which can improve your overall appearance. If you have large breasts your posture can really suffer, leading to hunched shoulders and major neck pain.   Find out if there's a yoga or pilates school in your local area, or look into what classes your gym offers — they often offer stretching classes which incorporate aspects of yoga and pilates.

This will discourage the cat from coming to your room at night for snuggles or attention. Lay out pillows, blankets, and nesting materials so your cat can choose what sleeping space it likes.   Consider putting up room-darkening curtains or blackout curtains in your cat's space. Since cats are most active in early morning and at twilight, the darkness may trick your cat into sleeping longer.; , Your cat may be more active in the evening if it doesn't get enough physical activity throughout the day. Try to play with your cat for 5 to 10 minutes several times a day. If you see your cat sleeping for several hours during the day, wake it up and play with it for a few minutes. Wearing your cat out will help it sleep better at night.Try giving your cat food puzzles to play with before bedtime. This will use up some of your cat's energy and give it a last snack before bedtime which may prevent it from waking you at night for food.  , If your cat is in the habit of eating its dinner in the early evening, begin shifting its dinner closer to its bedtime. This will keep your cat fuller longer so it won't wake you in the middle of the night looking for food. Instead of making a sudden dinner time change, gradually shift its meal time back by half an hour at a time.You could also feed less food at dinner time and reserve the rest to give your cat as a snack before bed.  , If your cat is only waking you at night so you'll feed it, you may want to just set out its breakfast before you go to bed. You could also use a timed meal dispenser if you're worried the cat will eat its breakfast too early. For example, you could set the dispenser to feed your cat every morning at the same time. This way, it learns to associate food with the dispenser and it won't wake you.If you choose to give the cat its breakfast in the morning, wait a while after you wake up. This way, the cat doesn't associate waking you up with getting its food.  , If you give your cat access to your room and it continues to wake you, consider closing your door so it can't get in. You may find that closing your door isn't enough and your cat continues to scratch or paw at your door. This is why it may be important to give your cat its own sleeping space.   If you choose to keep your door closed but give your cat free range of the house, be prepared to deal with several nights of your cat scratching at your door. Ignore the behavior so your cat learns to find somewhere else to sleep.  , Once you've changed your cat's sleeping environment and schedule, your cat's night demands should drop off after a week or two. If your cat is still waking you, talk to the veterinarian about giving your cat melatonin, a natural sleep aid. Giving your cat melatonin in the evening can help it sleep longer through the night before waking you.Melatonin may be a good option if your cat wakes you multiple times in the night.  , If your cat wakes you up once in a while, you should check to ensure that it's feeling alright. You may need to take the cat to the vet if it seems in pain or has been sick, especially if your cat doesn't usually bother you in the middle of the night.If your cat is fine and repeatedly wakes you, you'll need to start ignoring its night wakings.  , Once you've ruled out any medical concerns or issues that could be keeping your cat up, figure out why the cat is waking you. Your cat may want your snuggles or attention. Or your cat may be hungry and expect you to feed it. Determining why your cat is waking you will help you prevent future night wakings.Don't forget to check your cat's sleep environment for anything that could bother your cat. Your cat may not like a bright light shining into the room or may be upset if another cat is outside meowing.  , If your cat doesn't have any medical conditions and you've ruled out something bothering your cat, you'll need to ignore the night waking behavior. Completely ignoring your cat's bids for attention will teach it to stop waking you. Remember that even negative attention is attention.For example, you shouldn't even be in the habit of getting up and moving your cat or closing your door. Your cat will see this as a response and it will continue to wake you at night.  , It may be difficult to hear your cat whine for your attention and to ignore it, but you must if you want the behavior to end. It's important to consistently ignore the cat so it doesn't expect any sort of response from you. Keep in mind that your cat's whining will probably get worse right before your cat stops waking you. Just continue to ignore the behavior.   It will take one or two weeks for your cat to learn that you won't give it food or attention when it wakes you at night.

"['round up a small group of musicians', 'discuss the chord structure or key of the song', 'play through the melody of the song 1-2 times so that everyone feels comfortable', 'keep your head up as you play', 'feel the vibe of the song as it grows', ""improvise on the song when it's your turn"", 'share the spotlight', 'decide as a group when to end the song']",How to Jam1," You only need one other musician to jam with, but it is usually best to have at least one rhythm player (drums or percussion) and 1-2 other melody instruments (guitars, bass). While there is no law saying that you can't jam with 15 other people, jam groups generally stay smaller so that every musician can listen in and play off of every other musician. A small group of 3-4 similarly skilled musicians is a good place to start.   That said, there are many long-standing groups, such as blues bands, drum groups, and bluegrass bands, that have enormous, open jams, inviting a wide variety of skills and styles. Jamming is non-judgmental and free-form, so just have fun. If you're just starting to improvise, jumping into a large jam session is a great way to get your feet wet without a ton of pressure, as any mistakes you make are less likely to get noticed.; , Think of this as the guiding principle of the song. While there will likely be some improvisation and exploration, everyone needs to understand the chords in order to stay together. In general, most jams stick to simple, 3-4 chord songs or melodies that everyone already knows. The point of a jam is not to show off complex, interlocked instrumentals, but to allow each musician the freedom to experiment.   Jams can either play established songs, such as the blues jam classic ""Stormy Monday,"" or quickly improvised chord groupings. If you're confused, let someone pick a song and the chords and go from there. If you don't know the chords, sit back and watch another instrument or ask someone playing for advice.If you're a percussionist you should ask about the tempo, or set the tempo yourself if you know the skill levels of your fellow musicians.  , In general, you play through the song ""as written"" briefly, sometimes with vocals, so that everyone gets used to the feel of the song. If you're improvising the song on the spot, this is a good way to get everyone on the same page. Keep the first minute or two simple so that everyone can get used to the structure. Once everyone is on the same page the fun can begin.  , More often than not, one or two people will emerge as the ""leaders"" of the jam, keeping everyone on time and noting when people should take solos. As you play, keep your head up and watch the other musicians keep the band together. Eye contact, brief signaling, and even talking about upcoming chords or changes will help everyone stay on the same page.   As you get more comfortable with your fellow musicians, you can often hear when there is space for a solo and when the rhythm is changing, but you should still be looking up for visual cues from time to time. Watch any improvisational or jam band play live -- you'll notice small moments when the musicians make eye contact through the show, usually before changes, solos, or the song's end., If everyone else starts playing fewer notes, calming the energy down, come down with them. If things start to pick up in volume and intensity, let your own volume grow slowly. In most jams, no one instrument is supposed to take over the entire song. Each player needs to be aware of the rest of the band so that the song grows organically. While you play, listen to the entire sound of the band, not just your own instrument.   If you're struggling to keep up with every musician, hone in on the drummer. Follow his lead in energy, tempo, and sound. Feel free to adjust your playing, tempo, or melody, as long as it fits in with the rest of the band. You can help push the song in new directions as long as you don't try and take over the song.  , Musical improvisation takes a lifetime to master, so you're not expected to whip out a world-class solo on the fly. Improvisation is your chance to see where your instrument takes you, so relax and start experimenting. As long as you remember to stay in key, there is no wrong way to improvise, so just let go and have some fun.If you're new to improv, find a 4-5 note line you like and play it once or twice. Then start to adjust it, changing 1-2 notes each time you play it so you get variations on the same simple theme. If you can mimic the vocal line or a common melody, you'll be sure to keep the song moving. Don't feel the need to show off or be the best. Just play what sounds good to you., A jam is supposed to be an egalitarian, communal environment where everyone can feel free to let loose. No one enjoys it, however, when one person takes all the solos, or decides to solo for 2-3 minutes straight. If you're unsure what the protocol is, just listen into the other plays as they take solos or features. When your turn comes up, play for the same amount of bars (usually eight) as everyone else.   That said, some rock and roll groups, usually small, guitar driven bands, will jam on 4-5 minutes solos (see The Grateful Dead, Phish, etc.). It is more about feeling the mood in your particular jam than adhering to a hard and fast rule.  , Once everyone's taken a solo, most musicians will start looking around for a cue when to end. In general, once all the musicians have made eye contact, someone will say or signal for ""one more round"" or to move to the outro, if the song has one. This helps everyone come to an end at the same moment.   As the song ends, cut the number of notes or beats you play in half to ease out of the song. It also makes it easier to stop on a dime if you miss the ending cue.

Are you easily distracted? Do you read slowly? You may need to simply keep reading (reading takes practice), give yourself time (slow readers can still enjoy reading), and give yourself a quiet space.; , If you have a choice, find a book that you'll enjoy. This is an age in which there are novels on every conceivable topic.    Librarians can help you find a book that's of interest to you. You may be surprised how enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and helpful librarians are on a number of books.       Better bookstore staff often can offer guidance. Often, top selections for genres are displayed...usually these have broad appeal. In a given category (young adult literature, romances, historical fiction, sports writing, etc.) there are lists of top selling or highest recommended books. This can be found at places like Amazon.com, The New York Times Bestsellers list, and more. If something sells well, it's probably good.  , Try books that appeal to a large age range, as they are time tested, usually reasonably easy to read, and fun. English language suggestions: Charlotte's Web, The Harry Potter Series, The Chronicles of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass  , There are a lot of novels that aren't traditional books: graphic novels, or Japanese manga, for instance, may be more your taste.  , One of the biggest things that prevents many people from reading is their mindset. Instead of thinking thoughts like, ""I can't read well"" or ""I read too slow"", focus on the positive aspects of reading. Reading allows you to process thoughts faster and to learn and explore different ideas and cultures.  , Read the back cover or inside front cover. Both, if possible. Figure out the basic plot of the story. If there isn't any information on the book covers, Google it. Watch out for spoilers, though!  , Your reading nook should be somewhere quiet where you can concentrate without distractions. Try to avoid rooms where loud talking and electronic noises could mess with your ability to comprehend what you're reading. If you can't find a place in your house to read, try the library, a cafe or coffee, or better yet, the great outdoors! Beaches on lazy summer days make just as great of a place to read as your own backyard does!  , Set aside time for reading. But make this reasonable for you. For one person it may be 15 minutes, for another an hour--there's no perfect amount. But be sure it's enough time to make it useful to forward the story, but not so long you get restless, bored, or fatigued.  , If this is true of you, realize you are using time as an excuse...the TV, computer, game console, or cell phone can wait.  , The reward could be a monetary gift, such as a dollar in a little jar. When you complete your book, you will have enough for a night out with your friends, or to go out to dinner. Or, fill a jar with 10 or 20 marbles. For every hour you read, take out a marble. When you finish the book, count how many marbles are left. The fewer marbles missing the better. Mark a certain reward before finishing, and see what you've earned!  , You might be an individual that process books better through listening than with reading...and that's perfectly OK. It's understanding and enjoying the novel that matters, not whether you read it or heard it. A bonus is that you can listen while driving, cleaning the house, and other places reading won't work.  , Unless you are reading a particular novel for an assignment, remember that you don't have to read a book you find boring, offensive, or confusing. This is something you are doing for fun. Try your best, but don't give up reading completely just because one book ruins the experience.   Many bookstores, communities, libraries, and more have book discussion groups. It can really be motivating to keep you with a book, help your understanding of a novel, and meet new people. Some groups are specific (Oprah book club, teen groups, science fiction fans, graphic novels, mothers, and more.) If you happen to be a student, this can really help you in your literature classes in school!

Well, you could, but the result probably wouldn't be too great. And the exact same thing goes for singing! Hold your head up, place your feet shoulder width apart with one a bit in front of the other, and relax your arms at your sides. Keep that up!   Be conscious of how you stand. Do you tense up your shoulders or lock your knees out of habit? Do you slouch a little or rest all your weight on one side? These tips may sound nitpicky, but at the end of the day they can be the difference between an okay sound and a great sound.; , Your shoulders shouldn't be doing any work. If you've worked with a coach before, you know they're big on you being centered. That means you are breathing and getting energy from your core. So breathe deep and fill those lungs -- you're gonna need that air to power those notes.   If you're not sure if you're breathing from your diaphragm, try this test: lay down. Place a book on your chest and breathe. If the book is moving, you're not breathing from your diaphragm! Try to keep the book completely, 100% steady.  , Seriously. These notes will only come if you're totally relaxed. Most people hold unconscious tension on one side more than the other, so shake out your legs, grab your butt and shake it around (seriously!), and resume the position. Your mind is tension-free, too, right?   If you need to, disengage your mind. Find a spot on the wall and think about it. Think about the mere existence of that smudge. Focus on the air in front of you or your finger. It's only when you stop listening to yourself that you can stop that nasty autocorrect inside of you. And for the record, that autocorrect you have isn't any better than your phone's. You sound better when you don't consciously try to change your sound. It needs to be natural!  , There's a lot of metaphor in singing, but this isn't one of them. The sound literally needs to be forward in your mouth, coming out of the mask on your face. If that's confusing, experiment making sounds -- you'll know it when you find it. Try holding a finger in front of your mouth and singing at it; does that help? It should!   Another trick is to speak the words and then sing them just how you spoke them. At least as English speakers, the majority of our words are said fairly forward; mimicking that helps tell our brains what we need to do.  , This, however, is one of the metaphors. It's one of those things that singers get; if you've spent a while working on your voice, you may know what this means. The best way to visualize it is seeing the notes come out of the top of your head. For some reason, that imagery can be quite effective.   Sometimes we also have a tendency to get quite nasal; if you hear your voice leaning in that direction, remind yourself to ""open up."" You should hear a change in your sound automatically -- something that's more natural and less covered in gunk, if you will.  , Really. If you're in your bedroom and you're concerned about the 'rents hearing you, it's not gonna happen. Well, it may happen, but it'll probably be a bit squeaky and it'll hurt. Rest assured there are thousands of 14-year-old girls across the world doing just that right now. Wait until everyone is gone and you can roar. Louder, louder than a lion. You've got the eye of a tiger, a fighter, you're dancing through the fire and they're gonna hear your roar...but way better than Katy Perry does.   No, belting isn't about being loud. Being loud doesn't mean you're doing it right. But, by necessity, belting is loud. But there's so much more to it than that! It still needs to be a beautiful, spinning sound.  , We're talking a solid three, maybe four fingers up and down. It's a bad habit of many of us to relax and sing away as we normally do, but to hit those notes, a mouth that's open wider finds them more easily. So open up! Your mouth and your head!   To streamline your sound (like soundwaves punching the wall in front of you), keep your tongue near the back of your bottom teeth. Be careful to keep a curve in your tongue and not to spatulate it (flatten it, much like a spatula); if you do, it'll change the sound and make you more akin to Britney Spears. Successful, yes, but not the singer you want to be emulating.  , That's that regular, pulsating of the pitch you hear when you hold a note out. It's easy to scream in your chest voice on a straight tone, sure. But heads up: that's not belting. That's...well, that's screaming like a girl. If you hit a note, make sure your vibrato is in tact. It shouldn't be a machine gun, and it shouldn't be vibrating like a snail -- aim for somewhere in between. Two quick things about your vibrato while belting:   It doesn't involve moving your mouth. At all. Those women you see who look like their jaws are being electrocuted are faking it to get the sound they think sounds good. It needs to be in your throat, a natural part of your voice. If you can hit the note on a straight tone, you can hit it with vibrato. Just imagine the note spinning. If your vibrato is too slow or not there at all, you can take your finger to your throat and manipulate your voice box manually. That'll get the habit started for you.  , Belting takes stamina. Don't let anyone tell you that singing isn't a sport! If you keep doing it, you'll develop more endurance, your breathing will come easier, and those notes will be more attainable. Nothing good comes overnight, you know?   All your singing should be mindful and you should be rocking the correct posture and mouth positioning at all times, not just when you're belting. If you practice incorrect form, you'll just make bad habits. It's perfect practice that makes perfect -- not just practice.  , We're not kidding. If it hurts, you're doing it wrong. If it hurts, you risk developing nodes. If it hurts, you will lose your voice and maybe not just temporarily. So if you feel your voice getting scratchy or those notes you could hit 20 minutes ago aren't coming so easily anymore, take a break. You can revisit it again tomorrow.   In general, you should not practice belting for long periods of time. Keeping with the basketball analogy -- would you play basketball for hours and hours on end and expect to get better? No. After a while, your body just wears out and you start doing worse. It's the same with singing!  , This is actually quite the skill -- it's harder than belting, and it's definitely harder than just relying on your head voice. A mixed belt is when you use both registers simultaneously. It's your head voice, but with a twang. And it sounds so much like a belt that many people refer to it as a ""healthy belt.""This involves first strengthening your head voice. If you don't have that (if you've been concentrating on your belt, you won't), you'll need to work on the head voice first. Then you can transition from your head to your chest unnoticed -- using your mixed belt in between.  , Loads. It should be room temperature -- too cold and it'll shrink up your vocal folds and too hot and it could scorch them. Room temperature water keeps them loose, hydrated and relaxed. And it's good for the rest of your body, too!   If your voice starts to hurt (you've stopped, right?), consider going for some warm tea or gargling saltwater. But whatever you do, again, make sure it's not too hot. Warmth is enough to reap the soothing benefits of the water or tea.  , It can be expensive, but the absolute best thing you can do for your voice is to get a vocal coach. They'll ensure that everything you're doing is safe and healthy and, most importantly, sustainable. You don't want to be one of those declining divas in ten years due to poor singing habits! So ask around. Just an hour a week oughta do it!   If money is tight, consider hitting up your local college or university. Often vocal majors have to do some sort of pedagogy where they train students for free or for a very reduced price to complete their major. And it's a great way to meet friends with similar interests!  ","['water', 'head', 'diaphragm', 'sound', 'mixed belt', 'good posture', 'drink loads', 'mouth', 'vocal coach', 'tension', 'vibrato']"

However you find out about your teen's steroid abuse, be it through spotting symptoms or hearing about it from someone else, you need to confront them. Although your child may not want to speak about your concerns, you must be persistent regarding their health., Open up a discussion but do not get angry with them. Be there for them, allowing them to feel that they are safe and can express themselves fully. Ask your child about why they are abusing steroids and where they have been gaining access to them. You should try to obtain this information to help your child, not to punish them. Some things you may want to discuss include:   Your teen’s stress level. Talk to your child about their stress levels and even their self-esteem. Are they feeling pressured by others? Get to the root of the problem. Once you find out the reasoning, you have already achieved the first vital step.  , It is common for teens to deny their steroid abuse. If this is the case and your teen absolutely refuses to talk to you, you can purchase a home drug testing kit. Once the results are positive, there is no more room for discussion on the matter. At this point you will know for a fact, and will need to take the necessary steps to help them succeed in their recovery.  , You need to make a plan based on your child’s specific case. What does your teen need? How will you provide it? You need to make a plan of action. This will not only address what will be done but how you'll pay for it.   The cost may be covered through public or private insurance plans. If you do not know where to turn, consider contacting a program like the Anabolic Steroid Prevention for Teen Athletes, which is better known as ATLAS. This program, and others like it, provides high school athletes with information, counseling, and healthy alternatives.  , Once you have this discussion with your child, you need to seek some medical attention. It's important to see if your teen has experienced any damage to their health. Some side-effects are reversible, so it's important to see what damage has been caused. Set up an appointment for a physical with your family doctor.Medications that target symptoms of withdrawal and antidepressants are commonly prescribed to kids who have been abusing steroids. Talk to your doctor about medications and whether or not they are a good choice for your child.  , There are many different types of therapy available to help kids with abuse problems. These can be individual meetings with a therapist, or you can schedule family therapy sessions. There are also in-home counselors available through substance abuse programs. Some of the issues that may be discussed in the therapy sessions include:   Your child’s feelings regarding their athletic performance. Feeling of perfectionism and your child’s self-esteem. Major life transitions and their ability to cope. Anxiety related to personal relationships and situations.  , Group therapy is also an option as it allows others to share their experiences. When your child discusses the situation they are experiencing with others, they may gain valuable insights.   Talk to your doctor about group therapy sessions in your area. You can also run an online search.  ","['home drug testing kit', 'doctor', 'problem', 'appointment', 'situation', 'child', 'group therapy session', 'teen', 'psychologist', 'plan']"

Work toward those goals.  , Become useful to people and soon you will offer them advice. Being an adviser is being an influencer.   This is especially important if you do not have a high-paying job or a lot of money. Being a leader is the best way to gain power to influence others.  , Strive to remember names and information about people so that you can be influential during social situations.  , This is a great way to start helping others and gaining a reputation for it.  , Smiling, laughing and complimenting are great ways to influence people. If people are comfortable around you, they are more likely to do you favors.  , Your ability to stay in touch with people will make you more socially powerful. There are several ways to increase your social proof and stay in touch:   Start a LinkedIn profile, if you are gaining influence in the business world. Call an old friend once a week. Do it just to catch up, instead of only calling when you need a favor. Give to charity. Become an advocate of charitable organizations that your friends are involved with. Write personal Christmas cards. Write a tailored and thoughtful hand-written note to the person. Develop social media profiles. If you are involved in an Internet business, having thousands of Twitter or Facebook fans on your professional profile will give you social proof that you have influence.  , You will not be able to influence others if you are afraid to ask them for things. Start trading little favors early, so that you can influence important decisions later on. Understand that most influential people believe in reciprocity. As soon as you start doing favors, you will build an influential connection.  , Start a yearly event, such as a summer 4th of July part, a company Christmas party or a Halloween mixer where you invite people from your social and business circles. Both you and the event will become influential. , Look at people as you talk to them. Nod, and use other affirmations, to show that you are listening.  ,, Successful name-dropping means suggesting connections or meetings within your circle. If you are at a party and you want to meet new people or introduce people, use the names of people that are already in the circle.   Don’t name drop people outside of the social circle. Name-dropping can quickly change to bragging, if you suggest you know politicians, celebrities or musicians that aren’t relevant to your contacts.  , During the course of any conversation, you should aim to connect an interest, hobby or person. You can reference it establish common ground with a future topic.  , If you are trying to influence someone, give them a call to see how something has been carried out.

Not all devices are this obvious, though. In some cases the only sign is an out of place wire. Unless you're very familiar with your car, keep the manual handy to stop yourself yanking out a vital part.; , Get on your back and shine your flashlight onto the underside of the car. Most trackers link to GPS satellites, and won't function deep under your car where metal blocks the connection.Focus on the perimeter of the underside, looking for suspicious boxes, taped-on objects, and antennas.   If you see something odd, give it a light tug. Most tracking devices are magnetic and will detach easily. Check the gas tank first. Its large metal surface makes it an easy spot to attach a magnetic device.  , Check under the plastic guard of each wheel well, especially if it feels loose or bent. Any tracker should be obvious here — your car did not come with any weird boxes in this location.   If someone had extended access to your vehicle, you could remove the tires and check behind them, but it's not too likely a location. If you do look there, be aware that some brakes have a wired sensor behind them that is supposed to be there., The front and rear bumpers are the last common exterior locations to place a cheap tracker.Check behind them anywhere someone could slip in a device.   A device under the front bumper may be wired to the car's electrical system. Always compare the wiring to the manual before you remove anything.  , This is only a feasible location in two scenarios. First, an SUV or other tall vehicle can host a device perched in plain sight. Second, a sunroof can hide a small device inside the retraction slot.  , The front of a car is a hot, solid metal box regularly inspected by the driver. This makes it a terrible spot for a tracker. It's not impossible, but the average jealous partner or paranoid neighbor is unlikely to try this. Give it a quick glance and move on to the interior.   Out of place wires to the car battery may lead to a tracking device. Compare the wiring to your manual's diagrams before jumping to conclusions.  , Unzip seat cushions and headrests if possible. Look under any removable parts.  , Shine the flashlight up onto the underside of the seats. Note that some seats have heating mechanisms built in. Compare the appearance of the two front seats to find anomalies.  , On most models, you can unscrew the glovebox compartment, plus the panel underneath the steering wheel. Look for a loose wire that isn't taped or tied to other wires, and try to trace it back to its source.

If order for him to break up with you, change your social media accounts to look like you're single. Change your profile picture on Facebook and Twitter from one of the two of you to one of you by yourself. Remove your relationship status on Facebook. If you look like you are single long enough, he will get the hint.To make it even better, change your profile picture to one of you looking your best. He will get the hint that you are signalling others that you are feeling single and ready to date other people.Start talking on Facebook or tweeting with other guys. When he sees your interactions, he will understand that you are beginning to move on from your relationship with him.  , The next time that you and your boyfriend are going to hang with your friends, give them a heads up about the situation. Tell them that they don't have to treat him as nice or be as welcoming. When you are all together, ignore him in favor of spending more time with your friends. He will feel the cold shoulder from all of you and know that something is up., Whenever he brings up spending time with his friends, complain about the way they act or who they are. When you are with his friends, tell them how wrong they are. If he brings them up in conversation, tell him how awful they are or contradict him when he talks about how great they are. Guys are typically really close to their friends and he will get tired of you trashing them.If you know that you are going to be spending time with his friends, cancel your plans with him. This will show him how much you dislike his friends.  , Whenever you two go out, flirt with other guys. When you see a cute guy on the street, mention how hot he is. Get distracted from your conversation with your boyfriend because you are staring at a guy walking by. You can even flirt with his best friend. This will drive him crazy and make him mad, which will make him want to end your relationship., Nothing will make a guy run faster than you bringing up your ex-boyfriend all the time. Mention him in conversation, talking about how much you miss him or how you wonder what he's been up to. If your boyfriend compliments your outfit, say something like ""Oh thanks. My ex used to love me in it."" Not only will his ego be bruised, he will also get the hint that he is no longer good enough for you because you keep thinking about your ex. Or how hard would it be to say that you think that you guys would be better off friends? in the end think about what it is that you really want.You can start looking through pictures of you and your ex when your boyfriend is around. Change your profile picture on social media or the background on your phone from the two of you to you and your ex. This sends a very clear message that you don't want to be with your boyfriend anymore.  ","['social media', 'friends', 'guys']"

Cultivate it, work to achieve it, and follow the steps in this section to build it. Just be aware that it can't be faked—it has to come from the inside.; , Hunching over can not only cause back problems but makes you look as if you have no self-confidence. Sit-up straight too, for the same reasons.  , Smiling will make you appear happy. confident, and outgoing. It will also keep you from looking tired and in despair.  , It's only polite when talking to someone to look them in the eye. Don't stare—look at different parts of their face occasionally, but beyond that, maintaining good eye contact will show confidence and self-assuredness on your end.  , Your clothes and how you wear them say a lot about you, and will have an effect on how people perceive you. Wearing unflattering or extremely poorly-sized clothing says you don't care about how you present yourself.  The particular style is not as much a factor as how you wear it. You can wear whatever style is comfortable for you, whether it be trendy, alternative, casual or sporty, as long as it's appropriate to who you are. For example, if you're 30, and dress like you're 15, you'll look like you're trying to recapture your youth, not like you're a trendy 15-year-old. The same is true for any style—if it doesn't accurately reflect who you are, it will be seen as either clueless or fake. Neither impression will suggest ""handsome"" to anybody.  , When you're at a mall or walking down the street, take note of guys who appear to be fashionable. What things do you first notice?   Women often look at shoes—a detail many guys gloss over. Because so many guys gloss over that part, taking the time to select, wear, and maintain a nice pair of shoes is a great way to boost how you're perceived.  , If you have absolutely no fashion sense and have the money, hiring a personal shopper can be a good initial step. They will help you identify your style, select clothes for you and then show you where to obtain these clothes on your own in the future.   If you don't have the money, have a stylish friend or relative go shopping with you for the day. Listen to them, but be aware that they may have their own style sense that's not quite your style sense. If most of the choices they're suggesting don't appeal to you, don't feel like you have to go with their suggestions. Thank them for their time, and try another personal shopper more attuned to your sense of style.  , Having a signature item of clothing can help you stand out and draw attention to your style. Take Steve Jobs, for example. His signature look was a black turtleneck, blue jeans, and New Balance running shoes.   Jewelry, such as a trademark ring, necklace, or watch can be effective, and useful too. Tinted shades. You should only wear these outdoors, but a good pair of aviators or tinted shades draws attention to your face. Cologne. Avoid run-of-the-mill cologne and get a scent that no one else has. This can be a great conversation starter. Don't wear too much, though, or the conversation it starts will be behind your back, and it won't be complimentary.  , We all know how to talk, but being able to speak clearly and enunciate well will enhance how you are perceived.Know that voice is an impression itself.  , Wash your hands regularly. Your fingernails should be free of dirt and trimmed evenly. Do not bite your fingernails, or chew on your cuticles—you'll look nervous and neurotic.  , With extremely rare (and often accidental) exception, walking out of the house with bed head never looks good. Wash and brush your hair on a regular basis. If you have the time and inclination, consider using a paste or gel to style your hair, but follow the ""less is more"" rule with styling products, and don't use too much. , Many people, perhaps unfairly, associate bad skin with bad hygiene. Wash your face thoroughly, especially after any physical activity. Avoid razor burn if at all possible. If you're prone to acne or other skin conditions, see a dermatologist to help you get your skin in shape.  , Do this every day—it's an invigorating way to start the day, and looking clean and smelling good doesn't hurt in the perception department, either!  , Eating healthy will help with many things such as keeping a good weight, avoiding cavities, having a good complexion, and being energetic.  , Getting eight hours or more of sleep every night will do wonders for your complexion, energy and overall appearance.  , Looking handsome goes beyond your style. Exercising regularly not only helps with your appearance, confidence, and energy, but releases endorphins that make you feel good, and therefore more appealing to others.

Have you made a big life mistake? Do you feel like you are constantly making mistakes? Do you feel like there’s something in your past that you can’t let go of? Do you wish you were someone else? , Everyone has flaws, even when they seem perfect on the outside. Even you might appear perfect to others., Sometimes we think unexamined thoughts and allow them to shape our worldview. For example, you may think, “I don’t deserve this promotion, because I don’t work hard enough.” Work on noticing when you have thoughts like this.  , Is it true that you don’t work hard enough to deserve a promotion? Can you think of some ways that you have been competent at your job lately? Ways you have gone above and beyond? , When you catch yourself thinking an automatic negative thought, try to turn it around. For example, when you catch yourself thinking you don’t deserve a promotion because you don’t work hard enough, say clearly and firmly to yourself, “I do deserve a promotion. I have been a faithful employee for five years. I met all of my target sales for the last six months.”  , Does your older sister make you feel bad about your weight every time you see her? Is your dry cleaner constantly rude to you? You may not be able to entirely avoid these people, but try to reduce the amount of time you spend with them.   If you feel that you are being verbally abused or bullied, consider reporting the perpetrator to the appropriate authorities. (For example, for cyber bullying, you may want to report a perpetrator to the website administrator. You may want to talk to your boss if a coworker is bullying you.), This may mean that you have to consider hanging out with people you wouldn’t normally socialize with.   Is there a woman at the gym who always says hello to you and asks how you are? Maybe she would like to go out for a cup of coffee. Do the people in your Sunday school class make you feel very welcome every week? Perhaps you could organize a get-together for this group of people outside of church. Is there a coworker who always tells interesting stories? Consider inviting him to eat lunch with you in the breakroom or go out for a walk.  , Are you spending a lot of time on social media comparing yourself to other people? People tend to present an idealized version of themselves on the internet, so if you are comparing your life to the life of your Facebook friends, you may not be getting an accurate picture. , Is there an interesting museum, a beautiful library, a cozy coffee shop, or a sunny park that you can frequent? Try changing your surroundings to bring positive energy into your life. , You can say it out loud or in your head. It’s okay if you say the same thing more than once. You may not be able to think of a different thing every day, especially in the early stages of this process. Odds are, once you start feeling more positively toward yourself, you will find more and more positive things to say., Particularly if you are dissatisfied with your work and personal life, it is important to feel as though you are helping others. Studies have shown that the feeling that you are making a difference can go a long way toward improving your overall happiness and self-worth.Be sure to consider a volunteer activity that you will be successful at. If you’re good with children, consider tutoring. If you’re organized and efficient, consider working at a food pantry or a thrift store that donates its proceeds to charity. If you’re handy with tools, consider an organization like Habitat for Humanity.  , Achieving small milestones every day makes you feel repeatedly victorious and boosts your feelings of self-worth.   For example, “I want to lose 20 pounds before bathing suit season” may not be a realistic goal, and it may set you up to feel like a failure if you don’t achieve it. On the other hand, “I want to eat a sugar-free breakfast every day this week” is more realistic, and if you can stick to this goal, it will provide you a daily opportunity to feel successful., Laughter releases “feel good” chemicals called endorphins. Laughing more often can improve your overall feelings of well-being. Moreover, looking at a situation with humor can help it seem less threatening and overwhelming.Try   watching stand-up comedy on tv or in a club, watching a sitcom that you grew up with, going to a laughter yoga class, reading a joke book, playing with small kids or pets, or going to a game night at a local coffee shop (with raucous games like Taboo, Cranium, or Catchphrase).You can even simulate the feeling of laughter by holding a pencil between your teeth for about ten minutes. Your body will respond to the feelings in your muscles, and your mood will be slightly elevated., Physical exercise has a positive impact on overall mental health and feelings of self-worth. Low to moderate impact exercise (such as doing yoga, taking walks, or raking leaves) tends to have the greatest effect. If you can’t make time to go to the gym, work on adding movement to your everyday life. Close the door to your office and do ten jumping jacks once every hour. Park at the far end of the parking lot. Take the stairs. Eat your lunch while you take a walk.  , Physical health is often connected to feelings of self-worth. Additionally, vitamins, minerals, and good fats can elevate your mood.   Reduce foods high in sugar, caffeine, and alcohol. Eat foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, mackerel, or trout to improve mood. Try foods rich in vitamin D, including eggs and yogurt, to increase serotonin (a mood stabilizer) in your brain. Increase your vitamin B intake by eating spinach, broccoli, meat, eggs, and dairy products to improve your energy., Sleep has an enormous effect on your overall mental and emotional health. A good night’s sleep can change your whole outlook on the world. For higher quality sleep, try to   Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. This will help you establish a rhythm that your body can follow consistently every day. Only nap when absolutely necessary. Stick with 15-20 minutes at a time so that you don’t have a hard time falling asleep at night. Avoid screens of any sort (television, phone, laptop, etc.) for two hours before bedtime. , If you are a spiritual person, prayer may be just what you need to feel better about your life. Praying in a community (such as in your church or temple) could make you feel part of something larger and decrease your feelings of worthlessness. Even praying solo can make you feel that you are not alone.  , It is important to understand that you are not alone in your struggle. For some people, a caring friend or family member can provide all the support you need to get you through the feeling that you deserve nothing.  , Recent studies have found that people whose friends gave them compliments before completing a task performed better than people who did not receive compliments. “Fishing” for compliments is okay! Your friends and family can help remind you that you deserve the best life has to offer. , It’s possible that some element of your health is causing you to feel low self-worth. Your doctor can help you make decisions about taking supplements or developing an exercise regimen, or they can refer you to a specialist.  , You are not the only person who feels as if they deserve nothing. Seek out a support group online or in your local community. Try   http://online.supportgroups.com/ http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/find-support-groups  , Some of the many signs that you may want to seek professional therapy include   having emotions that are frequently overwhelming, living through a severe trauma, having frequent stomach or headaches, or other unexplained illnesses, and strained relationships. , If the feeling that you deserve nothing persists for a long time, you may be clinically depressed. Depression is different from sadness; it involves long term feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. Some signs that you might be depressed and should seek counseling include   losing interest in things and people you used to enjoy, long term lethargy, a drastic change in appetite and sleep, inability to concentrate, a drastic change in mood (especially increased irritability), an inability to concentrate, long term negative thoughts that won’t stop, increased substance abuse, aches and pains that you can’t explain, self-loathing, or the feeling that you are completely worthless.","['automatic thoughts', 'friends', 'people', 'respect', 'reasons', 'morning', 'laugh', 'therapist', 'general practitioner', 'thoughts', 'nothing', 'depression', 'support', 'rest', 'family', 'small goals', 'healthy diet', 'support group', 'compliments', 'time', 'social media', 'one', 'places', 'negative people', 'positive thing']"
"['make sure you have enough risk capital to invest', 'contribute to your 401(k) first', 'consider offline options', 'determine your investment style', 'locate several brokers', 'make sure you meet minimum balance requirements', 'look at their fee structures', 'determine the extent of services you need', 'select the broker that best meets your needs', 'register with your chosen broker', 'provide documentation', 'deposit money with the broker in order to start trading', 'try out the tools and services offered by your broker', 'do your research and make your first purchase']",How to Open a Trading Account," Risk capital is money you are free to invest. This money isn't used in paying your living expenses, repaying your debts, or held in your retirement account. In other words, this is money you could stand to lose (but obviously don't want to). In addition to your retirement account, most financial professionals advise that you keep about six month's worth of wages in savings. This is a good financial cushion to cover unforeseeable life events, like losing your job or becoming ill.Any money left over after this is your risk capital.   Six month's worth salary is a minimum amount to keep in savings. For more security, consider saving a year's worth or more.; , In addition to your emergency savings, you'll want to contribute to your 401(k) before committing money to risk capital. This is particularly true if your employer fully or partially matches your contributions. Max out the matched contributions to your retirement account each month before putting extra money into your trading account., Before signing up for online trading, think about your goals and experience with trading. Would you rather have a professional handle your money? Are you more willing to trust someone you can meet in person? Offline brokers can offer you services and expertise that online broker cannot, so take these options into consideration before committing. Outside of online brokerages, you have two major options: money managers and full-service brokers.   Money managers are the most hands-off of all of the broker options. They handle all of your trades, determine goals for your portfolio, and update you on its growth and progress. However, they also charge large management fees and require initial investments upwards of $100,000 or $250,000.Full-service brokers offer, as the name implies, the most amount of services. They sit down with you to determine your financial goals based on your age, retirement plans, marital status, personality, and risk tolerance. They work with you to make investment strategies and also will make direct trades if you call and ask them to. They can offer advice on anything from taxes to estate planning. Accounts can be opened for as little as $1,000, but fees are generally higher than those for online brokerages., If you're still planning to invest online, you'll need to determine what type of trades you'll be making. If you'll be doing more day trading, you'll need a platform that is responsive and has low per-trade fees. Alternately, if you plan to make long-term investments, you can afford a platform with higher trading fees that offers more services. Your decisions here will inform your choice of brokerage.   Day trading is a stock trading strategy in which an investor buys and sells the same stock within the same day. Day traders typically hope to take advantage of small price fluctuations and make quick returns., Select trading platforms that are reliable and well regarded. You'll want to be satisfied that the brokers are knowledgeable and responsive to your needs. Well-known platforms will be the most reliable. However, if you choose to go with a more obscure brokerage, make sure the platform is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before committing your money.   Some of the most reputable online brokers are: Fidelity, Scottrade, E*Trade, OptionsHouse, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, TradeStation, and Interactive Brokers., The first requirement you'll have to check is whether or not you meet the broker's minimum account balance. This is the smallest amount that you can deposit to start an account. For some of these brokerages, if you lose money and your account balance drops below this amount, you will still be charged additional fees for having too low a balance. Total up your risk capital and compare this to the required minimum balance at each brokerage.   For reference, most online brokers require between $500 and $1000.However, there are also discount brokers with a $0 minimum and higher-tier brokers with minimums of up to $25,000., Online brokers vary widely in fees charged. Some charge monthly or annual service fees, some have high per-trade fees for securities, and some charge more or less on mutual fund purchases, among many other types and amounts of fees.Any broker will have this information readily available to potential account holders. Visit their website and jot down their different fees and how they might apply to you.   Again, which fees are most relevant to you will depend on what type of trading you plan to do. High trade commissions are a non-issue if you plan to hold your securities for long periods of time. However, a day trader would prefer one of the brokers with $1 trade commissions. Day trading has been proven in academic studies to be less profitable that passive investing (buying and holding securities for longer periods of time). This is partially due to losses sustained on bad trades, but also to fees charged on each trade., Many larger, and more expensive, online brokers have advanced research and analytical tools for your use. If you plan to make quick, daily trades based on market information and analytics, you may get your money's worth out of these tools. However, if you plan to be a more passive investor, you may want to look for a more basic service that charges you lower fees., Narrow down your broker list first by choosing only those with low enough minimum balances. Next, look at the services offered and choose those which offer the services you need. Finally, look at the fee structures and determine which one will be cheapest for you to use. Select that broker.  , Go to ""create a new account"" or ""register."" This will likely be in a prominent position on the broker's main webpage. You'll likely have to enter your email address and create a username to get started.  , During the application process, you will be asked to prove your identity and provide financial information. You may also be required to scan or fax in certain documents. For most brokers, you will need the following information and documents:   Personal information, like your name, address, and work information Your Social Security number or card Your W-9 form Up to two other forms of identification Other information or documents as required by your broker., Compile your risk capital into one account and deposit this money into your trading account. Many brokers offer electronic fund transfers for your first deposit, while other may require that you mail in an actual check., Take a tour of the platform and familiarize yourself with major tools and pages. Work out how to see your current positions in total and individually. Take advantage of every service you think you might use; after all, you're paying for them anyway.  , You may already have a purchase in mind, but you should still do your research first to make sure this is a sound investment. When you're ready, make your first order and wait for your broker to fill it. Make sure to not put all of your eggs in one basket here; diversification is key to building a successful portfolio.

Some cover only financial issues, whereas others address health care issues. These powers of attorney can either become effective immediately, or on a future date, when you are unable to make decisions on your own behalf, due to disability, illness, or injury. The state of Texas has established a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney law that allows you to choose the type of power of attorney that best accomplishes your goals.; , A Statutory Durable Power of Attorney or financial power of attorney typically allows your agent to make all financial decisions on your behalf. This gives your agent the power to enter into transactions and make decisions about your bank accounts, real estate, investment accounts, loans, and other debts. The power of the agent to make these decisions continues until a durable power of attorney is revoked or destroyed.   A durable power of attorney can give you a certain measure of privacy. If you don’t want your affairs to be publicly known, you can designate an agent to handle business and financial matters on your behalf. This is often the case with wealthy people or those individuals who own many assets. The current statutory durable power of attorney form allows you to specifically pick out which powers you want your agent to have. Only the powers you choose will be authorized by the power of attorney form. A typical power of attorney goes into effect immediately. However, a “springing” power of attorney only goes into effect when you become incapacitated and unable to make your own decisions, or on a particular date that you designate.  , A special power of attorney gives your agent authority only to handle a specified business transaction or set of transactions. For instance, you might grant a special power of attorney to your agent to simply sign a particular contract on your behalf. It also may contain specific dates in which the power of attorney is to be in effect. Once those dates have expired or the specified transaction is complete, a special power of attorney document is no longer valid.  , A healthcare or medical power of attorney gives your agent the right to make medical decisions on your behalf. These decisions might include choosing the facility to treat you, authorizing surgeries and medical procedures, and allowing treatment as recommended by medical professionals. A medical power of attorney only goes into effect when you are incapacitated due to your medical condition and unable to make decisions about your medical care on your own.   A healthcare or medical power of attorney is often accompanied by an advance directive, which is sometimes referred to as “A Directive to Physicians and Family or Surrogates.” This document allows you to make certain end-of-life decisions, such as matters related to resuscitation and life support.  , It is difficult to choose just anyone to act for you as your agent. With respect to your finances, you want to make sure that the person you choose is someone is responsible and disciplined enough to handle all matters related to your financial affairs. Likewise, with respect to healthcare decisions, you need to choose a person who is aware of your wishes concerning your healthcare and who will make the appropriate decisions based on those wishes if you are unable to do so.   Many people choose a trusted family member or friend to handle their affairs. Some people choose a long-time lawyer or trusted advisor to become their power of attorney.  , A power of attorney is not legally valid if it attempts to designate a minor, or a person who is under the age of 18, as your agent. Similarly, you cannot execute a valid power of attorney if you are not an adult over the age of 18.  , All too often, individuals fall victim to schemes in which their friends or family members, or sometimes even virtual strangers, persuade them to execute powers of attorney in their favor. Avoid choosing anyone to be your agent who stands to financially gain from making decisions on your behalf.  , You are appointing an agent to make decisions for you so that your express wishes are carried out, despite your inability to make those decisions. If your agent doesn’t know how you feel or what you want with respect to a certain issue, the likelihood of your wishes being carried out is slim.   If you are executing a statutory durable power of attorney, you should be sure and make your wishes known to your agent about how you want your business matters to be handled. Do not simply take for granted that your agent knows what sort of decisions you would make in certain situations. If you are executing a healthcare or medical power of attorney, specifically talk to your agent about your views on different types of life-sustaining medical treatments. Explain how you feel about these issues and tell him or her what decisions you would like made on your behalf.  , After you have chosen which types of powers that you want to grant your agent whom you wish to be your agent, you will need to ensure that you are executing the proper forms. Different legal forms and documents are available to fit different situations. The most recent versions of these Texas forms are available online at this site.You can get these forms online or have an attorney prepare them. The benefit to having an attorney prepare the forms is that the attorney can evaluate your situation and make sure that you are executing the proper forms based on your situation. Avoid forms that are commonly for sale at office supply stores like Staples or Home Depot. Texas, like many other states, has specific requirements for powers of attorney to be valid. These forms may not be specific to the state of Texas and therefore may not comply with Texas law.  , You will need to fill out your power of attorney forms completely. It is advised that you have your agent, or the person whom you are granting the powers, present when you decide to fill it out. You also can have your attorney draft the forms for you. If using the statutory form, you will need to affirmatively initial each of the individual powers that you wish your agent to have. Here is the other information that you will need to provide on the forms:   Your full name and address The full name and address of the person whom you are designating as your agent The full name and address of the person whom you are designating as your successor agent, or as your second choice to be your agent if the first person whom you chose is unable or unavailable to serve as your agent There is space on the form to specifically describe any additional or more specific powers that you want your agent to have, aside from the powers listed that you have already chosen and initialed. The medical power of attorney form also asks for phone numbers for you, your agent, and your successor agent. There is space on the medical power of attorney form where you can list any limitations that you want to place on your agent in terms of limiting his or her authority.  , In Texas, all power of attorney forms need to be notarized. This can be done by going to the nearest bank branch. The bank will usually notarize forms for free if you have an account with them. If you do not have an account with the bank, they may charge you a small fee for notary services. For instance, Bank of America charges $8.50 to notarize documents. Your lawyer’s office also is likely to have a notary on staff.   The current Texas medical power of attorney forms also require that two witnesses be present when you sign the forms. The witnesses also must give their contact information and sign the forms. The current Texas statutory durable power of attorney forms do not provide for witnesses other than a notary public. Your agent is not required to sign any power of attorney forms.  , If your chosen agent is not present when you sign your power of attorney forms, you will need to notify him or her that you have signed a power of attorney granting him permission to take certain actions on your behalf. This gives the agent notice of his or her ability to make decisions for you in specific situations.  , In Texas, you do not have to submit the power of attorney forms to any agency for it to be valid. You just have to keep an original or copies with you at all times in case you may need it in the future. You might want to keep the original document in a safe at home or in a safe deposit box at a bank. If a lawyer drafts a power of attorney for you, he or she will automatically keep the original documents on file in his or her office.  , If necessary, your agent should be able to provide a copy of the form to anyone who requests it. Most agencies or offices will need to see a copy of the power of attorney in order to let your agent operate or make decisions on your behalf.   The person whom you have chosen to be your power of attorney should have multiple copies of the forms. You may wish to provide a copy of your power of attorney to offices where your agent may have to do business or make decisions on your behalf. For a healthcare power of attorney, you would want your doctor’s office and your local hospital to have copies. For a durable power of attorney concerning business transactions, you would want your bank and investment advisor to have copies. Place a copy of your power of attorneys on file with your lawyer, particularly if he or she has written a will, trust, or other estate-planning document for you. You generally should also make sure that your spouse and/or adult children have copies of your powers of attorney. If you don’t have any such close family members, you might give a copy to a trusted friend or relative. In some cases, you may need to place the original power of attorney on file with your county court.  , You always have the right to revoke your powers of attorney if you no longer wish your powers of attorney to be in effect. You do not have to give or even have a reason to revoke these documents. There are five different ways that a power of attorney can be become invalid.   Destroy the original powers of attorney and all copies. Execute new powers of attorney as you wish and give a copy of the documents to all relevant parties, thereby replacing the existing powers of attorney. Sign a document that revokes the existing powers of attorney and deliver a copy to all relevant parties who might have had a copy of the existing powers of attorney. This includes the person whom you had previously named as your agent. If another person obtains guardianship over you due to your incapacity, the existing power of attorney will be superseded and no longer in effect. Your power of attorney automatically is revoked upon your death.

Anxiety and nervousness will cause you to overthink the situation. Remember, this will one day be unimportant and a distant memory. The sooner you explain what has happened, the sooner it'll be over, and you can start looking towards doing better.Take deep breaths and focus on pleasant thoughts. Take your mind off of your grade for an hour by doing something that makes you happy, like reading a book or playing a game.; , Think of positive things you have accomplished. This way, you can share the good news as well as the bad news. If you can’t think of any new accomplishments, come up with a plan for improvement. Prepare a solid plan or physical proof of how you plan to do better in the future.Plan a meeting with your teacher, or talk to your teacher about the bad grade beforehand. Prepare a study plan. Don’t hide or throw away the grade. It may be tempting to hide, “forget” about, or throw away your grade. Do not do this. Chances are, the bad grade will come to light eventually. The bad grade may need to be signed, or it will reflect in a poor grade on a report card.It is always better to go the honest route. The punishment and reaction will be worse if you delay the news.  , Try to prepare the right environment for breaking bad news. Don’t wait to tell them in a crowded area, or during a fun family outing. A good time to tell them would be during or after dinner, when they are unlikely to be caught up in other responsibilities.Don’t talk to them as soon as they come home from work. Allow them some time to unwind before you start a serious conversation with them. Schedule a time with your parents if you are not sure when to talk to them.  , Don’t approach the situation in a defensive or rude manner. Your parents will respond better to good manners and a thoughtful approach. Talk to your parents as you were taught to speak to your elders.Never resort to inappropriate name-calling or cursing. Do not raise your voice. Keep your voice calm and steady.  , When the moment is right, ask your parents if they are available to talk. You should take advantage of a quiet and private area. Try sitting down instead of standing, as the conversation may take a while.Approach your parents confidently and seriously. Don’t act silly or upset. Your parents will be more likely to react positively if you display the right behavior.  , Get straight to the point. Don’t build up the conversation by trying to pad the situation in your favour. For example, you can say something like ""I got a bad grade,"" or ""I'm very sorry, but I didn't do very well on a quiz/test/exam.”, Don't make excuses. It might seem easier to be dishonest about your grade, or make excuses about it. Dishonesty and excuses will not benefit you because they do not change your grade. Your parents will appreciate and acknowledge the fact that you were straight and honest with them.There is a difference between excuses and legitimate reasons for a bad grade. Differentiate the two. An excuse is, “My teacher made the test too hard.” A reason is “I didn’t understand the material.”  , Be direct with a simple statement at first, but your parents will probably want an explanation. Stay honest when you explain to them what happened. If you didn’t study, tell them. If you tried your best, but still failed, tell them.Something you could say is “I had a hard time understanding the material,” or “I didn’t study for the test, which led to me doing poorly on it.”Be honest with yourself about why you made a bad grade. Don’t convince that it wasn’t your fault if it was. If accurate, tell them about how you know you should have studied more. That will show them that you've learned from your mistake.  , Lay out the plan you've made, and tell them how you plan to improve in the future. Show them comments from your teacher, your study plan, or tell them how you will avoid distractions.Tell your parents that you will make effort to do things like set up a meeting with your teacher, turn off your phone and television while studying, and study for at least an hour a night. Physical proof or a well thought out plan will be more convincing than comments thought up during the conversation.  , You may typically be a good student. Remind your parents of this. This may keep them from overreacting if they remember what kind of grades you usually bring home. Do not, however, treat the bad grade lightly if it is an ongoing problem.Something you could say is “I may have done poorly on this test, but this is a rare occurrence for me. I will make an effort to do better next time.” If bad grades are a recurring problem you could say, “I haven’t been doing well in school lately, but I am going to do my best to change that.”  , Know that your parents want what is best for you. Parents want the best for you, and it makes them nervous when they think your future is being damaged. Your parents have most likely been through school, and they have probably dealt with bad grade themselves. Take their advice, and understand their frustration is mostly concern for you.Do not talk back if they are lecturing you. Being rude and disrespectful will show that you do not take the situation or your parents seriously. Your parents might be angry or frustrated, and that is normal. Being mentally or physically abused is not normal. Talk to your teacher or proper authorities if you think you are being abused.  , Before they give you a punishment, offer fair punishments. Tell them that you are willing to give up television for a certain amount of time, or that you won’t go the party you were invited to that weekend in favor of studying. Doing this will show your parents that you know the bad grade is a problem, and you are willing to fix the problem., Your parents may or may not accept your suggestion for a punishment. They may decide on a different and more appropriate punishment. Either way, accept the punishment. Do not argue with them, or try to deny the punishment.Don’t act out against the punishment. Don’t sneak out if they ground you, or don’t watch television if you are banned from it.  , Many school systems have a way of viewing your grades online. If they don’t already have the login information, give it to them. Alternatively, if your school does not have an online system, make an Excel spreadsheet of your grades, and give it to them weekly.Keeping your parents updated will motivate you to do better, and show your parents that you care about your grades.  , Suggest that your parents sit down and help you with homework. If you are struggling to understand your work, ask your parents if it is possible to get a tutor. If you aren’t sure how to improve, ask your parents what they suggest.Keeping your parents involved will likely make them more understanding if you get a bad grade in the future.  , Tell them about anything that is inhibiting your education. Don’t be afraid to tell them everything. Tell them about bullies, distractions, or trouble concentrating. Your parents are there to help you.Something you could say is, “There is an ongoing distraction at school (or home), that prevents me from concentrating on my studies.” Tell your teacher if there is an ongoing distraction or bully in your class.  , There are many bad habits that lead to low grades. Avoiding these habits in the future will help you do better in your studies, therefore preventing stressful confrontations with your parents. Some of these bad habits are:Copying a classmate’s homework instead of doing your own work. Not asking questions when you don’t understand the material. Cheating on quizzes and exams. Forgetting the due dates of essays, projects, quizzes, tests, etc. Keep a calendar for the due dates of your schoolwork. Failing to take notes during class. Taking notes during class will help you avoid zoning out and not paying attention.

You may want to use a cheap spiral or composition notebook or opt for a nicer hardcover journal. Today, however, a variety of additional digital options are also available. Any sort of computer program that allows you to input and save text is a potential journal - conventional word processors work well, as do free cloud-based writing programs like Google Docs.   If you're looking at computer-based options for your journal, you might want to consider starting a blog - essentially an online journal that other people can read. A variety of free blog sites exist, some of which allow you to control who can and cannot read your blog.  , To begin writing in your journal, label your first entry with the date, time and, optionally, location. For instance, you might start with ""Monday, January 1, 1.00p.m., Bedroom"". Next, if you'd like to, write a salutation. Many journal-writers like to use ""Dear Journal"" or a similar greeting to start each entry. However, this is completely optional.   If you're writing a blog, you may want to begin by addressing your readers.  , Let your emotions flow! There's no right way to write in your journal - however you feel in the moment is how you should write. In terms of subject matter, don't hold back - no topic is off limits. Your feelings, your dreams, your crush, your family life, and much more are topics you might consider exploring. Or, if you're feeling pretty average, you might just describe your day! Let your heart flow through your pen or keyboard. Get your true feelings down on the page - don't settle for anything less.   As an exception to this rule, if you're writing a blog, while you'll want to be open with your emotions, consider your audience. You may want to consider censoring your most intense and/or personal thoughts.  , Journals are best if they're added to frequently. Writing often allows you to keep constant, ongoing record of your thoughts and feelings. So, keep writing! It's easy to lose steam after the first few enthusiastic entries, but the benefits of keeping a journal are greatest if you can manage to make a routine of it.   Many journal-writers like to add an entry every night before bed. This is a healthy routine because it allows the writer to relax and unwind at the end of the day by ""letting out"" any lingering emotions.  , Why write your thoughts down if you never intend to read them? It's always good to take a few minutes every once in a while to look at your finished work. You may be surprised by how you felt in the past! Being able to assess your past thoughts and emotions objectively with the benefit of being separated from them by time can give you insights into how to proceed with your life in the future.   Use your past entries to reflect on your life. As you read, ask yourself questions like, ""Am I the same person who wrote this entry?"", ""Is my life going the way I want it to?"", and ""How can I work to solve any problems that may have been troubling me when I wrote this entry?""  , Each entry in your journal should be uniquely ""you"". Unless you're keeping a journal solely to record the empirical facts of each day (miles walked, tasks completed, etc.), you should try to have fun with your journal entries! Add doodles in the margins, lyrics, movies reviews, and anything else you want - it's all up to you!  , If you don't have your journal, you can't write in it! Travel is one of the best opportunities for journal writing - long days spent in planes, trains, and automobiles offer plenty of chances to write at length, and the unique experiences you often find yourself in while traveling practically beg for comment. Write frequently as you travel and be a constant observer - keep your eyes and ears open for new sensations and experiences so that you can write about them.   The experiences you have while travelling can be some of the most influential ones in your life. Discovering the beauty of nature, making a friend in a far-off place, and even simply leaving your home can shape you, so document these things!  , Unless your want your journal to be as plain and unassuming as possible (which is a legitimate option if you're worried about other people reading it), experiment with customizing your journal. The exact way you do so is up to you! If your journal is a notebook, for instance, you may want to decorate the outside with drawings or stickers. Inside, you may want to include photographs, newspaper clippings, pressed flowers, and more!   If you're using a digital journal, like a blog, try adding photographs to your posts, including links, and choosing colorful templates.  , Unless your journal is a blog that's open to the entire internet-browsing public, you should probably assume that no one will read it but you. If you choose to share it later, it'll be up to you to do so, but a journal is perfectly useful even if it's never shared. Try to consider your journal as a ""safe haven"" for your innermost thoughts. It's a place where you won't have to worry about being judged or embarrassed about the way you feel, so have no shame while you write.  , Most people have internal thoughts that they ""filter"" whenever they interact with other people. If you meet an ugly person on the street, for instance, you would never blurt out that you find them ugly - instead, you choose which thoughts to let out and which thoughts to keep in. The trick to good journal writing is to ""turn down"" or even ""turn off"" this filter. This can be tricky - often, its' something people don't have a lot of experience doing.   If you're having trouble turning off your filter, try writing ""free form"" as an exercise - scrawling your thoughts down in a stream-of-consciousness form the moment they come to you, whether they make sense or not.  , While you'll want each journal entry to stand up on its own merits, you may find that your entries can be made better by explicitly referencing past entries. By searching for explanations of why you wrote the way you did previously, you can come to a greater understanding of your own emotions.   For instance, were you in a miserable mood when you wrote yesterday, but are now feeling better? Comment on this! By doing so, you may start to understand why you felt this way in the first place.  , Not every day will be eventful. Writing won't always come easy. Instead of giving up for the day, try, instead, to answer any one of the hundreds (if not thousands) of journal prompts available online. Writing educators occasionally use journal-writing as an academic exercise - when they do, they sometimes share the writing prompts for the exercise online. A simple search engine query like ""journal writing prompts"" can yield dozens of interesting results. Use the tools at your disposal for consistent journal greatness!   You may find that, by pursuing a prompt, your writing ventures into interesting new areas you might otherwise never have explored. Be adventurous and pursue these new topics to your heart's content!  , Many famous and highly influential books are either the actual journals of real people or works of fiction written in the form of a journal. Both can help you become a great journal writer. Below are just a few of the works you may want to consult for inspiration:   The diary of Samuel Pepys  The Diary of a Young Girl (Anne Frank's diary) The diary of Jemima Conduct The diary of Franz Kafka Bridget Jones's Diary Diary of a Wimpy Kid The Color Purple Flowers for Algernon Dracula Gentlemen Prefer Blondes  ","['greats', 'past entries', 'ideas', 'first entry', 'safe place', 'journal entries', 'something', 'insights', 'personal style', 'journal', 'past journal entries', 'scene']"

You simply put the beads onto the cord and knot it. You do not need a clasp. To learn how to make a stretchy beaded bracelet, click here. You can buy beading elastic in a bead shop, or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store.   Clear elastic thread comes in many different thicknesses. Thicker elastic is sturdy, which makes it suitable for large beads. Thinner elastic is more delicate, and looks best paired with smaller beads.Elastic cords have a thread or fabric covering. They are thick by beading standards, and usually come in black and white.; , Beading wire cannot be tied like elastic, and must be used with crimps and clasps. The crimps help hold the bracelet together. Be sure to use beading wire, which is flexible. Wire used for wire wrapping is too stiff and thick; it is not suitable for beading. To learn how to make a beaded bracelet with a clasp, click here.   Consider using memory wire for a fun, spiral bracelet.  , Smaller beads will work well on thin, delicate elastic. Large beads, however, will need something heavier, such as a thicker elastic or wire. You will also need to add extra length to your bracelet if you are using bulky beads. These beads fill up the space between the bracelet and your wrist, making the bracelet fit tighter.  , There are many different types of beads. Each material has a specific look, and some types of beads are more suitable to certain projects than others. Here are the most common beads you will find in bead shop or an arts and crafts store:   Plastic beads are the least expensive and come in many different shapes and colors. They are ideal for kids' arts and crafts. For a fun, kid-friendly bracelet, try using elastic cord in a bright color, and using plastic pony beads. You can also use alphabet beads so the kids can spell their names on the bracelet. Glass beads are beautiful, and come in many different colors. They capture the light well and had a mid-price range. Most glass beads will be translucent, and some will have designs. Semi-precious stones tend to be more expensive than glass beads. They also tend to be heavier. Because they are made from natural materials, no two beads are alike. You can also find beads made from natural material, such as shell, wood, ivory, and coral. These tend to be expensive and unique; no two beads are the same.  , When buying beads, you may find that the beads are already strung for you. This is simply another way of packaging them, and is not suggestive of a final design. Simply snip the beads off their string and arrange them in a new pattern on your desk or bead tray. Here are some ideas for a design:   Put the largest beads towards the center, and the smallest beads towards the clasps. Alternate large beads with smaller/spacer beads. Use a warm (red, orange, yellow) or a cool (green, blue, and purple) color scheme. Choose a bunch of beads that are all the same color, but in different sizes and shades. For example, you could use light blue, medium blue, and dark blue beads.  , You can find them in bead shops or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store. They usually come in gray, and have a velvety texture. They have necklace-shaped groves with measurements. This allows beaders to lay out their pattern and see what their necklace or bracelet may look like before they put the beads on the string.

"['select an inexpensive cut of meat to braise', 'select a braising liquid', 'start with a mirepoix or some mix of finely minced vegetables', 'choose additional vegetables to add as well', 'always use a heavy-bottom stew pot or dutch oven', 'prepare the meat for braising', 'brown the roast and then remove it from the pot', 'add the mirepoix and sauté over medium-high heat', 'add about an inch of your braising liquid', 'return the meat to the pot', 'cover it', 'and place in the oven at 325\xa0°f (163\xa0°c)', 'add additional vegetables 45 minutes to 1 hour before the meat is done', 'remove the meat when fork-tender', 'remove the beef from the pot and let it rest', 'reduce the remaining liquid to create a sauce', 'pair with an appropriate side', 'finish the dish with chopped herbs or other additions and garnishes', 'marinade roast beforehand to braise sauerbraten', 'use sliced bottom round to make braised swiss steak', 'make carbonade flamande', 'make the ultimate comfort food with beef bourguignon']",How to Braise Beef," While it may seem contrary to usual meat-buying logic, tougher or less-tender cuts of meat are perfect for braising. Pot roast, chuck roast or any inexpensive cut may be used. The muscle fibers and connective tissue that make these cuts stringy or tough are broken down by braising, which gelatinizes the collagen into a more palatable texture. Low heat and long cooking times are used to make a tough cut of any kind of meat moist, tender, and delicious, when cooked properly. Common cuts of beef for braising include:   top blade roast eye roast seven bone, or center-cut pot roast shank ribs or short ribs brisket It's unlikely that you would ever want to braise any kind of lean steaks or loin. You could, but because these meats are tender already, it'd be a bit of a waste.; , Other than a pot and your cut of beef, the only other absolutely essential ingredient is a liquid in which to simmer the meat. Because this is an opportunity to add a dash of flavor to the dish, it's most common to use wines, stocks, or other flavorful liquid, as opposed to water.Common braising liquids include:           Beef stock or broth. You can match the stock to the dish by using a beef-based broth or stock, although using chicken stock would is universal for braising any type of meat, and might add a nice complexity to your braised beef. Stock is just broth that hasn't been seasoned, so stock is generally better for braising, since it allows you to control the salt-levels, but either is acceptable. Just go easy on the salt if you use broth.Red wine. Dry red wine can add a nice acidic note to beef, especially when combined with another braising liquid, like stock. The alcohol cooks off, resulting in a rich and fragrant dark sauce. Especially fruity or sweet red wines would be less desirable, but fine if paired with an equal amount of stock to cut the sweetness. The fruitiness of a white wine would pair better with chicken or pork. Since it'll season your dish, make sure it's something you'd like to drink--pour yourself a glass for ""research.""  Dark beer. English cooking at its finest. Stouts, porters, or black lagers all lend a rich sweetness to beef, and a malty depth of flavor. The darker the better, when it comes to beef. Some Belgian ales might also work nicely, but experiment and find a beer you with a nice flavor. In general, lighter pilsners and lagers are more appropriate for chicken or pork. How much liquid you'll need will depend on the amount of meat you're braising, and the addition of extra vegetables. As a general rule of thumb, you'll want enough liquid to cover the vegetables at the bottom of the pot and come up just to the level of the meat. You're not boiling the meat, or stewing it, so you won't submerge it in the braising liquid. It won't take much, and you can always add additional water to the pot if you didn't have enough wine left in the bottle.  , Sounds fancy, but it's not. In French cuisine, braised beef and many other meat dishes will always start with a vegetable base of finely minced carrot, onion, and celery, called mirepoix, which is used to pair with the meat and enrich the sauce. After searing the meat, the mirepoix is added and browned briefly before adding the braising liquid to the pot.   For a proper braising, there needs to be something at the bottom of the pot other than the liquid, to give the sauce fragrance, substance, and character, as well as to keep it from drying out. When minced very small, the mirepoix will mostly disintegrate into the liquid over the course of the long cooking time, to flavor the sauce, though you could leave larger chunks to do more of a ""pot roast"" style braised beef. Depending on the cut of meat, you might use around 2-3 carrots, 2-3 celery stalks, and a small white onion.  , Depending on what you want to do with the beef you braise, you might elect to make a one-pot meal with the addition of vegetables. In most braising, some variety of aromatic vegetable will always be used to keep the moisture consistent in the bottom of the pot, as well as to release other flavors and aromas. Cooking beef low and slow is a great opportunity to cook vegetables as well.   Other vegetables like potatoes, cabbage, peas, mushrooms, greens, leeks, or other root vegetables can be added to the pot later, about 45 minutes before the meat is done cooking. Some fruits, like apple or pear, can also pair nicely with braised beef, depending on the season. Use firm, slightly under-ripe fruit, if you want to experiment.Aromatic herbs like rosemary, sage, bay leaf, or thyme can kick your braised beef up several notches. If you've got access to an herb garden, or just want to buy some fresh herbs from the store, tie up a bundle of a few stalks in twine and add at the same time you add the braising liquid.  , Braising starts on the stove and moves into the oven, making it important that you start in a pot that's oven-safe. Enameled cast-iron pots are perfect for braising, featuring the heat-retention of cast iron and the hefty weight of a good baking dish.   Skillets aren't generally big enough to hold all the braising liquid, meat, and vegetables required for a good braising, while thinner sauce-pans won't hold the heat as effectively as cast iron. If you don't have a cast iron dutch oven, though, anything you can cover and put in the oven will do in a pinch. If you don't have a oven-safe stew pot, but have a heavy-bottomed saucepan, it's perfectly fine to braise meat on the stove-top as well. Some cooks prefer the oven method because it more evenly-distributes heat throughout the meat, while others prefer the simplicity of braising on the stove. Both methods result in tender and delicious beef.  , Season the meat on all sides with an even coating of salt and pepper. Go easy if you're going to braise the meat in broth, which will also be seasoned. If you want to add other spices to the dish, wait to add them until after the braising liquid has been added. Don't worry about trimming off fat or connective tissue, which will be broken down during the cooking process, providing great flavor.   Some cooks like to dust the meat with a light coating of flour before browning it, while others choose not to. Flour can help to create a nice attractive crust on the meat during the browning, and it will work to thicken the sauce. Additionally, it helps to dry out the surface of the meat to promote browning. If you don't dust with flour, dry off the meat before you attempt to fry it. Damp beef won't brown. Depending on the cut of meat you're using, you may want to trim up the beef into manageable pieces, or leave it whole to braise the entire roast. Either method is perfectly fine, and will only majorly affect the presentation of the dish after it's done. In general, braised beef will be left whole, while ""stewed"" beef (which is submerged in liquid) will be cut into smaller chunks. The techniques are largely similar, so go with what you like best. If you'd like bite-sized chunks, go ahead and cut up your roast ahead of time. If you'd rather leave it whole and fork it apart later, that's fine too.  , Put your pot on the stove over a medium-high heat, coating the bottom with about two tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil starts to smoke, add your meat and let it brown on each side, until you've created a nice dark crust on the outside. Turn the meat periodically and be very careful not to scorch.          You need to brown meat over high heat to cook the outside, not the inside. You'll cook the meat through in the liquid, so the browning is just used to create that tasty outer-layer of crust, as well as to season the bottom of the pot with drippings and little burned-on bits. The inside should still be very pink after you've browned it. Remove the meat from the pot and set it aside.  , In the drippings and browned bits stuck at the bottom of the pan, add your finely-minced carrot, onion, and celery. Stir the vegetables around as they brown, taking care not to let them scorch.  , When your vegetable base is browned, add a small amount of braising liquid to deglaze the bottom of the pot. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up the stuff stuck to the bottom, which will help to flavor the sauce and the meat. Add enough liquid to cover the vegetables and bring it to a simmer.          The difference between stewing and braising is the amount of liquid you add to the pot. Although they're very similar processes, technically-speaking, braised beef requires only the smallest amount of liquid, enough to cover the vegetables and create a humid environment in which to cook the meat. If you add a bit too much, don't worry, it'll be just as good.  , Once you've got the braising liquid up to a gentle simmer, add the beef back into the pot, settled gently on top of the vegetable/liquid mixture. Cover the pot securely and put it in the oven.   If you want to braise on the stove, reduce the heat immediately to low and cover the pot securely. To keep things from drying out, it might be helpful to add a bit more liquid than you normally would, more like you would for a stewing, and to leave the cover on the pot as much as possible. Every time you remove it, the moisture will be released, causing it to get drier. As the meat cooks the liquid should condense and intensify, but the pot shouldn't dry out because you have the lid on. As it condenses on the top of the pot, it'll drip back down on top of the meat, basting it and keeping everything moist. Because you're creating a little cooking climate in the pot, you shouldn't remove it and mess with it. Let the pot and the heat do the work.The braising liquid should not be boiling. If the lid of your pot is rattling because the bubbles are aggressive, turn the heat down some. Anywhere between 250 and 350 F is appropriate for braising. The lower the temp, the longer the cooking time.  , To make sure everything finishes cooking at roughly the same time, you should add vegetables to the equation later in the cooking process, depending on what you want to add.    Root vegetables like parsnips, turnips, carrots, potatoes, and beets can and probably should be added earlier in the cooking process. Add root vegetables to the pot when you return the meat, and cut into uniform bite-sized pieces.  Delicate vegetables like greens, mushrooms, beans or peas should be added quite near the end, no more than an hour before you remove the braised beef from the oven. These may be added whole.  Defrost any frozen vegetables you'd like to add before adding them to the braising pot. Adding frozen vegetables can bring down the temperature considerably, and they won't need to be cooked for very long anyway.  , Depending on the size and variety of the cut you're braising, it should cook between 2 and 4 hours to reach its most tender state, and reach an internal temperature of around 160 F. When the beef is done, it should literally fall apart with very little pressure from a fork.   As the meat cooks, moisture will be forced out, drying it out. When it reaches 160 F, it'll technically be ""done"" at this point, but it won't be as good as it can and should be for a proper braising. Since you've gone to all the trouble to braise it, really braise it. After a bit more time in the oven, the fibers will relax and reabsorb the gelatinized collagen, making the meat very tender. You shouldn't need to worry about under- or overcooking a braised beef dish. Cooking it longer only makes it better, and there's almost no risk of over-cooking it. If you're in doubt, cook it longer. It's not a dish to rush.  , When the beef is done cooking, remove it from the braising liquid, set it on a plate or a carving board, and cover it with foil to retain the heat. Braised beef should rest for at least 10 or 15 minutes before you carve it.   You can carve braised beef however you wish to serve it, depending on the particular cut. Slices are appropriate for brisket, while short ribs will likely be left whole. Fork-pulling some roasts might be appropriate, as well, if you want more of a BBQ-style dish. If you've added additional vegetables, you can remove them as well, if you want to reduce the liquid to create a sauce or gravy. Spoon into a serving bowl, cover, and set aside.  , After you've removed the beef, put the pot back on the stovetop over medium-high heat to reduce the amount of liquid by half, or until it reaches the consistency you desire. Season the sauce to taste with salt, pepper, and a dash of Worcestershire.   If you want to make gravy, you can also thicken the sauce by mixing a slurry of about a tablespoon of flour and a quarter-cup of sauce in a separate bowl. When the slurry is mixed thoroughly, with all the lumps whisked out, add it to your sauce slowly, whisking as you go. If you dusted the meat with flour before browning it, the sauce might thicken on its own by reduction. Cook it down some to check for the thickness before you worry about starting a slurry. Other additional aromatics like ginger, lemongrass, grated citrus rind, or garlic can be added to the liquid as it reduces for the sauce.  , Most commonly, you'll see braised beef paired with the vegetables it was braised with, if you chose to include any, and a potato dish of some sort. Braised beef is excellent with the following side dishes:    mashed potatoes or mashed sweet potatoes  hash browns sweet parsnips turnips or ""neeps"" greens like mustard, collard, turnip, or beet   , A bit of chopped flat-leaf parsley, rosemary, or fresh herb of your choice can liven up the braised beef. Arrange on a platter, spooning over the reduced sauce or gravy you made from the leftover braising liquid.   In many parts of the world, braised beef is a common Sunday supper, especially in the cold winter and autumn months. After slowly simmering the meat in the oven, the whole house smells rich and warm.  , A German variation on a basic braised beef, sauerbraten involves marinating a browned round roast in a mixture of vinegar and aromatic spices for up to three days before adding sugar and braising the beef in the marinade.For the marinade, heat a cup of apple cider vinegar and red wine vinegar in a saucepan, with about two cups of water, over medium-high heat. To this, add one small chopped white onion and a half cup each of chopped carrot and celery. Toss in a teaspoon each of mustard seeds and whole clove, 2-3 bay leaves, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes while you brown the roast. After about 10 minutes, turn it off and let it cool to room temperature.  Brown the roast in olive oil before removing and placing in a pot suitable for holding the meat and all the marinade. When the marinade has cooled slightly (you don't want it to cook the meat) pour it over the beef and let it sit in the refrigerator for about three days, turning it once a day to make sure the meat is equally submerged.  After three days, braise in the oven at 325 F for about four hours after adding about a third of a cup of sugar to the marinading liquid. After braising, crushed-up gingersnaps and raisins are commonly whisked into the juice to thicken and add sweetness to the sauce, which is then poured over the sauerbraten.  , While it has absolutely nothing to do with Switzerland, swiss steak involves the ""swishing"" process, by which one flattens fabric (in this case meat) with rollers or hammers. The tough meat is then braised in a rich sauce made from tomatoes, until fork-tender and delicious. Combined with mashed potatoes and fresh corn, there's nothing better than a properly cooked swiss steak.To prepare the meat, cut round roast along the grain to form steaks roughly one half inch thick. Dredge each steak in flour, then pound out with a meat tenderizer until the steak flattens by half. Dredge the steaks again in flour and brown them on the skillet, over medium-heat in your dutch oven, or other oven-ready pot, on both sides. When the steaks turn golden brown on both sides, remove them from the pot and set aside.  To create the sauce, fry a small white onion, chopped, two or three cloves of garlic, and two large celery stalks in your pot. Sauté until the the vegetables are browned slightly. To this, add a tablespoon of tomato paste and a can of diced tomato (or two medium fresh tomatoes, chopped), and about a cup of beef broth. Stir and bring to a simmer, adding some chopped oregano, Worcestershire sauce, and a tablespoon of lemon juice to the sauce.  Return the meat to the pot and braise in the oven for about an hour and a half, covered, at 325 F. The meat should be done when it's fork-tender.  , Served with crusty bread, sweet-sour carbonade flamande is a deceptively simple Flemish flavor bomb, and a great way to mix up a traditional pot roast or braised chuck roast.Start the process by cubing the beef into bite-sized chunks and browning them in the dutch oven. Remove them from the pot, then crisp up about 3 or 4 strips of chopped bacon, turning down the heat when the fat renders out into the skillet. To the pot, add a whole white onion, chopped, and slowly caramelize the onion adding about 2 tablespoons of butter to the mix.  Deglaze the pan with a bottle of Belgian ale, adding a cup of beef stock, and two tablespoons each of brown sugar and apple cider vinegar. Season the braising liquid with chopped tarragon, parsley, thyme, or whatever green herbs you prefer, and salt and paper to taste.  Return the meat to the pot, then cook on the stove over low heat, covered, for about two hours, until he beef is fork-tender. Some recipes call for the braised meat to be topped with slices of bread for the last bit of the cooking time, which is broken down and stirred into the sauce to thicken. Often, this dish is served beside Belgian fries, or french fries., The technique is easy and the flavor is classic French haute cuisine. It doesn't need to be complicated to be good.Brown cubed roast in bacon grease, then remove it and sauté the mirepoix. Stir in a tablespoon of tomato paste and add about 20 white pearl onions and a pound of white button mushrooms. Add salt and pepper to taste, while gently stirring the mushrooms and onions to coat. Deglaze the skillet with 2 or 3 cups of dry red wine, preferably Burgundy, and a cup of beef or chicken stock. Season with two bay leaves, and whole leaves of sage, rosemary, and oregano.  Return the meat to the pot and braise at 325 F for about 3 or 4 hours until the meat is fork-tender. If the sauce is a little thin, remove the meat and cook it over medium-high heat on the skillet to reduce and thicken. Serve with roast potatoes.

For example: an award you recently received, a new teacher/lecturer at your school or college, a new style that everybody is wearing, which of your hobbies you like the most, and so forth.; , You don't have to be entirely familiar with your relative to be polite. Just avoid topics that might be touchy, be respectful of their opinions and avoid arguing the point on anything.   Be considerate as well as being polite. For example, if a relative recently passed that Uncle Larry was close to, don't say anything that might stir up bad memories.  , Make a reference about the food you are eating. It's a common task that can take the conversation far. It will often draw in others too, as they won't want to appear remiss in mentioning the chef.  , Current events are ways to get family to talk about opinions or experiences, as well as discussing whether they're going or not. It's also a great way to find out what other events are coming up, as they'll share the things they're planning to do that haven't been mentioned yet.  , This can ease a bit of tension, by allowing others to contribute to the conversation. In particular, look for the quiet ones who seem willing to say something but need prompting, out of shyness, fear or uncertainty.  , This is a great conversation topic that really can get things moving. Asking after what a mutual friend/neighbor or person is now doing can be a great way to connect various people and to lead into further discussions.  , If people wish to talk about something that you're not that interested in, make an effort to appear interested for at least a short time. You can change the subject after it's clear that they've said their piece and feel heard, not before.  , Offer to hand out food when people are seated elsewhere than at the table. When at the table, pass food promptly and considerately so that everyone gets a share. It's another good excuse to talk too, as you can ask how they like the food, what their favorite foods are and whether they'd like more.  , Offer to do the dishes, put things away, clear up, etc. Encourage others to help too. It's a good way of having a chance to natter with those who are helping with you and to get the cleaning up done quickly, so that everyone can get back to conversing together. Do not leave the chef all alone in the kitchen, unless he or she prefers it that way.  , If some of your family members are parents of small children, offer to play a game with the kids outside or in another room, to give the parents a break and a chance to chat with the rest of the family without constant interruptions. You'll get to spend time with the kids and you'll get lots of appreciation and respect from the parents.  , If there are members of your family who need assistance for any reason, offer to walk them home, drive them home or even catch public transportation with them. It's a kind gesture and you'll get to spend some one-on-one time with them to learn more about them.

It also works well for pipes running along one wall seam.   You will need to box in the pipe from two sides, so there needs to be two nearby walls. Even if the pipe does not lie directly in a corner or along a wall seam, it should be relatively close.  , Use a combination square to determine the depth, width, and length of the pipe space you'll need to hide.Place the square portion of the measuring tool against one of the walls. Measure out from the wall to the exterior side of the pipe to determine the necessary depth. Repeat this procedure by measuring from exterior of the pipe to the other wall. This should give you the necessary width. Make sure that you are measuring at the widest point of the pipe. Measure the length of the pipe, as well, so you'll know how long your boxing will need to be.  , Cut three battens so that the length of each one matches the length of the pipe from wall to wall (or ceiling to floor).Note that if one or two of the battens will be placed over a wall with skirting on either end, you will need to make these battens a little shorter than the full length one. Measure the wall length again, this time working from skirt to skirt, to find the altered length. These battens will be used to support the box sides. Use plywood roughly 2 inches (5 cm) wide by 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep to create each one.  , Screw the battens to the wall so that they surround either side of the pipe.   Measure out from the corner seam of the wall when placing these battens. The placement of one should match your previously measured pipe depth, and the placement of the other should match your previously measured pipe width. Use screws and wall plugs that will work on the type of wall or ceiling you're dealing with. If you're fixing the battens onto masonry, you'll need to use 5.5 to 6 mm drill bits, 2 inch (5 cm) number 8 screws, and red wall plugs set to fit holes and screws of this size. Space the screws apart by approximately 15.7 inches (40 cm). Drill a pilot hole into the wall, hammer in the wall plug, then gently twist the screw into the plug.  , Measure and cut two plywood boards. These will become the sides of your pipe boxing.   The length of each board needs to match the length of the pipe space and the length of the battens. The width of one board must match the distance between the wall and the outside edge of one batten. The width of the other board must match the distance between the other wall and the outside edge of the other batten.  Note that these distances should also match your pipe width and depth dimensions from earlier, but it can be a good idea to measure the space again before cutting the plywood boards to size.    , Attach the edge of one box side to its corresponding wall batten using sturdy wood glue.   The plywood side should rest on the outside of the batten with the width side of the board sticking straight out from the wall. Make sure that the length of the board covers the length of the batten and the pipe. After gluing the plywood side in place, further enforce the bond by inserting heavy-duty construction staples or nails into both the board and batten. Space the staples 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart.  , Use wood glue to attach the remaining third batten to the other end of the plywood box side.   Position this third batten so that it runs parallel to the first. It should be to the inside of the plywood box side and on the opposite side of the wall. Reinforce the bond with wood staples or nails placed 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart.  , Place the second measured and cut plywood side so that it covers the remaining exposed side of the pipe.   One side of this piece of plywood should lie to the outside of the open batten. The other side of this piece should form a corner with the opposite piece of plywood (the one previously attached to the wall). Attach the plywood to both connecting battens using both wood glue and nails or staples.  , If desired, you can minimize the appearance of the boxing by painting or staining it to match the color of the wall.   Before painting, remove furniture from the room and cover the floor and all fixed appliances with plastic sheets. Doing so should prevent paint from splattering onto other surfaces.  , After the paint dries, seal the seams with decorator's caulk or silicone. Squeeze a small, steady bead of caulk across each seam and let dry.   Sealing the seams will prevent unwanted moisture from getting into the pipe boxing. If moisture does get into the boxing, it could create mold or cause the wood to rot. Once you seal the seams, the project is complete.

You can bleach your hair, then mix small amounts of the chemicals later to touch up your roots.; , You can get some hair from your hairbrush and going through the bleaching process with it to test how it will go. It's better to test it out first; that way, there won't be any surprise you'll have to grow out!  , Don't use styling products that may cause buildup. Leaving your natural oils on your head helps to protect your scalp and hair.  , The night before you intend to bleach, soak your hair in coconut oil and leave it in overnight. Again, this helps protect your hair and scalp from damage.  , Once you begin, you must work quickly to avoid burns, so having it all there helps.  , Put on your goggles and gloves! Add tape around them to protect your eyes.   Note: You should wear a button down shirt or a loose fitting top so that you can take off your shirt to rinse your hair without getting bleach all over your clothes.  , Liberally smear around your hairline, ears and neck with Vaseline to provide a barrier between the bleach and your skin.  , Add 2 ounces (60 ml) of bleaching powder (or 1 scoop of clear developer and 1 scoop of bleach), in a room with windows. Remember that you will get a higher lift if you use 30 or 40 volume. They also have a higher risk of burning your scalp.  , Then commence mixing the bleach and developer mixture. Prepare to apply the mixture.  , DO NOT start at your roots, unless you want to come out with lighter roots and darker ends.   You can put foil under a section of hair, paint on the bleach, then wrap up that section in foil if you like. Make sure it is hairdressing foil and not tin foil from the grocery store or you could damage your hair.  , Keep 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) away from your roots initially. After you have finished the rest of your hair, apply the bleach mix to your roots, being careful not to massage it into your scalp too much.   Avoid putting the bleach directly onto your scalp. If you do, it will sting or burn a little bit, and it will hurt a bit. If it burns a lot, this is a chemical burn. Rinse it out immediately.  , You may wish to put more bleach, earlier, on whichever part of your hair is darker. So if your roots are dark and the rest of your hair has been bleached before, bleach the roots for 15 or 30 minutes longer than the rest of your hair. If your roots are light or blonde and the rest of your hair is darker, paint the dark bits first.  , Put a shower cap, aluminum foil, or clear/white plastic bag over your hair. Make sure it's not covering your face, but is over all of your hair. Then tie it at the nape of your neck, making sure all of your hair is tucked underneath the bag.   If you want a higher lift, use aluminum foil instead of a plastic bag. If you are using a grocery bag, make sure the side with printing on it is NOT against your head, or you will wind up with the color of the print processed into your hair a bit.  , Check your timer. If you leave it on for longer, it won't get any lighter, it will only damage your hair more.   Check the color all the time. Once at a pale yellow, you must wash off the bleach. Don't leave bleach on for over an hour. Don't bleach once at pale yellow or hair will break. If not at pale yellow then rinse it out, tone your hair and wait a month to re-bleach your hair. (See Following Up with More Bleaching.)        , Wash out with a PH neutralizing shampoo. This will stop any further acidic or basic chemical reactions from occurring on your head. This will formally end the bleaching process.   You ‘’must’’ wash out the bleach mixture completely, or else you will damage your hair. After a while, the developer and powder stop reacting and your hair won't bleach any more, only become more damaged. If you over-bleach, your hair might end up feeling a little bit straw-like and brittle. If you're in doubt, rinse it out.       Make sure to use a shampoo and conditioner designed for bleached blonde hair to eliminate any yellow and make your hair bright platinum and white. Any purple shampoo is fine. Remember purple counteracts yellow, makes it white, and eliminates brassiness.        , Once hair is pale yellow, it is time to tone or color, if desired. Toner is semi-permanent hair dye that can counteract some of the unwanted hues from bleaching.For a natural platinum look, dye it with a natural blonde mixture with 20 developer, since hair is already bleached. Leave on 25 minutes. For pale silver platinum, use a platinum dye with 20 developer, and leave on for 25 minutes. For yellowish-white, leave it the way it is after completely stripping all the color with the bleach. Use a lot of purple shampoo to eliminate and dull yellow or dye it a level 12 color. Leave on 25 minutes. For white blonde or white use a white blonde toner, and leave on 25 minutes. Many of these toners are semi permanent, so color will fade and you can redo the toner the following week.  , Make sure your hair gets repair treatment and keratin protein and softening treatments. User a deep conditioning at least once a week  , Bleaching weakens your hair a lot, so adding protein will make it stronger and less susceptible to breakage. This takes a few hours to harden and about half an hour to wash out, so you must allow time to do it properly if you choose it.  , If you under-bleach, and your hair is an orange tone, you must wait a month in order to avoid damage to your hair and skin and then bleach it once more.  , Apply once a month, until your hair is a light yellowish color. Use the same process as above: shampoo with a pH balancing shampoo, apply toner as desired, and be generous with conditioning treatments.  ,, Do not bleach or dye your hair for more than an hour at a time, and always leave a month in between for processing time for your hair and scalp to heal. Otherwise, your hair will be damaged, dull, frizzy. Hair will become brittle and tend to break and there's a possibility your head will be covered in scabs, which will develop into bald spots. Always condition in between! Be patient.  , Make sure you keep up the good care of your hair, since bleaching can be a rough process. Condition often and use protein treatments to strengthen your hair and prevent breakage.

You might notice a slight movement out of the corner of your eye and not even realize that what you noticed was a mouse. Next time you see a movement, take it as a sign that you should investigate further.; , It's easier to hear mice at night when the house or apartment is quiet. You may hear a light tapping or scratching that sounds like it's coming from the walls.   If you hear sounds of mice running along the walls, that's a sign that you've got more than one creature to take care of. If you hear squeaks, you may have a mouse nest full of babies on your hands.  , Mouse droppings are small, dark and seed-shaped. New droppings are wet and black, and older ones will have dried out to a lighter gray color.   Note which room you see the droppings in. The presence of droppings in a room should indicate that something in the room is attractive to mice. The presence of droppings can also indicate that there's a crack or hole in the room through which mice can enter.  , If you can determine the pathways the mice often use, you will be able to catch and track the mice more easily. Mice often establish runs and use the same pathways time after time. Usually the runs are not directly visible so the mouse is only visible as it traverses a few feet of open floor or counter top., Of course, it will be along the runs if you have been able to identify them. And you will probably find the nest near where you saw a concentration of droppings. Nests are usually built in the corners of cabinets or closets. Look in out-of-the-way places that don't often get disturbed.   Mice chew through cardboard boxes and items of clothing to use as materials for their nests. Look for tiny holes in the pile of clothes you've left sitting in the back of your closet. A musty smell might also indicate the presence of a mouse nest.  ,  Mice are lured into these traps by the scent of bait placed inside it, usually peanut butter or cheese. They enter a small hole and get trapped in with the bait. Once a mouse has been caught, you can take the trap to a field or the woods and set the mouse free.  Make sure to always use surgical (or other) gloves when baiting or handling traps. Mice have an extremely good sense of smell and will not enter a trap that has been handled by humans or that smells ""off,"" perhaps because of chemical smells or soap residue. Be aware of your handling from the time you start to unwrap the trap after your purchase and strive to not touch the trap directly with your skin, ever. This will assure best chances of trapping your target(s). Set live traps in the room where you found mouse droppings or a nest. Live traps are more expensive than other types of traps, so you might want to start by buying just one or two. If you have a bigger infestation of mice, it might not be practical to catch them with live traps, since you'll likely have to make a lot of trips to the woods to set them free.  , These types of traps look like little cardboard houses. The bottom is lined with a sticky substance that attracts mice, then traps their little feet so they can't run away. Be aware that this often results in a still-living animal stuck on the trap.   Buy several sticky traps and place them around the room where you saw mouse droppings or a nest. Don't forget to put some in the cabinets and closets. Bigger sticky traps can trap more than one mouse at a time. Mice don't die right away in sticky traps, and unfortunately you may hear pained squeaks coming from the traps. You may need to humanely euthanize any living mouse that you have caught on it. Keep this in mind when you're deciding which trap to buy.  , Snap traps are baited with a bit of peanut butter or cheese. When the mouse steps on the trap to eat the bait, its weight causes a wire to snap down on the mouse.   Snap traps are cheap, so you can buy a lot of them and place them wherever you think mice might be present. Place a piece of newspaper under each trap for easier cleanup. Since snap traps kill mice instantly, they're actually more humane than sticky traps. However, they can be less pleasant to deal with. Make sure to throw out snap traps as soon as mice are caught, and sanitize the area afterward.  , Cats are natural predators of mice, and they are as good at catching mice as any trap. Let your house cat spend time in the room where mice are present. It shouldn't take long for your cat to take care of the problem.   Some people borrow a friend's cat for this purpose. Having a cat stroll around your property is a good mouse deterrent and may prevent them from coming inside in the first place.  , Scrub every nook and cranny to get rid of mouse nests and materials that mice might want to make into nests. Throw out old boxes, bags, books, magazines and any other paper or cloth materials you might have lying around.   Sanitize any areas where you found droppings, a nest, or trapped a mouse. Don't store your possessions in cardboard boxes sitting on the floor, since mice can chew through cardboard easily. They can even chew through plastic or wood and will do so if they have a reason. For example, they smell food or think they might be able to create a secure hiding place. Clear out general clutter, especially in corners of your house or apartment that aren't frequently used.  , You might not think of it as mouse food, but mice are attracted to all types of edible substances they can find on the ground, on counters and in cabinets.   If your trees drop edible nuts and berries, make sure you rake them up frequently. Clean up spilled birdseed from under the feeder a few times a week. Make sure your outdoor garbage can has a tight lid, and always keep it covered. Don't let cat or dog food sit out all day; clean it up after your pet has eaten.  , Make sure all grains, nuts, and other dry goods are stored in tightly sealed plastic, glass or metal containers.   Half-used boxes or bags of food are attractive to mice, be it human food or pet food. Store the remaining food in an airtight container and recycle the box or bag. Don't leave bread or fruit sitting out on the counter for more than a day or two. If food items you leave on the counter or on top of the refrigerator become a problem, tighten up. Use a metal bread box and work out a storage method for fruits and vegetables that you do not like to refrigerate. Clean your pantry and cabinets often. Make sure crumbs, dried juice, and other stray bits of food don't sit on your kitchen floor. Remain vigilant and observe any signs of pantry raiding by the pesky critter, then provision to eliminate the opportunity for the mouse family to dine.  , Make sure the gap under your door isn't providing a convenient entrance for mice. You can buy materials to seal the gap at a hardware or home and garden store.   Keep your windows closed or screened. Seal any cracks or holes you find in your walls, especially exterior walls. Steel wool is a cheap material you can stuff into crevices to deter mice.  , Place a substance known to repel mice in the corners of your home and around doors, cracks, and other places mice may enter.   Peppermint and other strong oils contained in ""strewing herbs"" repel mice. Cut a sponge into 1"" (3cm) squares and saturate each with peppermint or eucalyptus essential oil, then place these strategically around your house and kitchen. You could plant some mint around your windows and doors and use the herb in teas and in sachets to freshen your cabinets and closets. Bay leaves also repel mice. Crush them up and sprinkle them around your house, or tuck whole leaves in the corners of your pantry and cabinets. Mothballs are an effective repellent, but these are toxicand can cause problems for children and pets. Naphthalene is a pesticide and sublimates readily so you should think thrice before employing this method. Additionally, moth balls are more expensive, require replacing often when the balls sublimate, and are not as eco-friendly as herbs or herb-based essential oils. Make sure children and pets are kept away and closely monitor them for signs of a reaction to the mothballs should you decide to use them. If there are mice in your walls you can usually get rid of them by using a syringe and squirting ammonia into the wall. The fumes and smell will chase them out. This is especially effective in manufactured and mobile homes where there is often a space at the bottom of the wall for easy access.

To grease the pan, butter is preferable, but non-stick spray, olive oil (a non-flavored kind), or shortening work, too. You can also cube the bread into 1"" pieces if you want a uniform, classic, make-no-mistake-about-it bread pudding.   What kind of bread to use? Well, that's sort of up to you. But sourdough, French, brioche, Italian, or even sweet rolls will guarantee a delicious flavor.  , Try to get it spread as evenly as possible, because you want every bite to have a hint of buttery goodness. Mix it up in the pan a bit if need be to immerse all the pieces.  , If you're using raisins, of course! You can also use 1/2 cup of another dried fruit if raisins aren't your thing. But toasted nuts (pecans, anyone?) or even fresh fruit (like a chopped apple) are to die for, too.  , If you're looking for a twist, the zest of a lemon or orange or 1/4 cup rum or grand marnier could do the trick.   What does ""milk"" really mean? It can mean anything from soy to 2% to a mixture of milk and cream, if you're feeling extra decadent. The thicker and creamier it is, sure, the fattier it'll be, but it'll also be more scrumptious, too.  , Make sure it gets everywhere! Mix it up a bit so all sides of the bread can sop up the flavor.  , This helps the bread absorb the mixture and to coat all bread pieces. Mix it up slightly to spread the mixture evenly.   At this stage, you can opt to put the pudding in the fridge for up to an hour to give the flavor a chance to soak into the bread. However, if your stomach is rumbling now, it can be skipped.  , You'll know it's done when you insert a toothpick into it and it comes out clean. Let the bread pudding cool for 10-15 minutes. You can resist for that long, right?  , You can also top with milk or cream to make it extra gooey.

After it comes out of the oven and while it's cooling, grab your saucepan and start making a sauce to pour over the individual servings. It's quite simple:   Combine 1/2 cup sugar, 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup cream, and 1/4 cup Jack Daniels in your pan. Heat over medium-low and when it reaches a light boil, take it off the heat. That's it! Drizzle over the pudding and try not to salivate.  , ...Or maybe it does get better. Heat 1 stick of butter, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 egg in a saucepan, whisking and stirring till it thickens. Then, whisk in up to 1 cup of bourbon and take off the heat. Drizzle over and enjoy!

Basically these girls are your sisters. Think big like Sex and the City. All those grown women are friends. Your friends need to be focused on meeting each others demands. The school needs to envy your strong bond with one another.; , You need to have your own fashion sense. Don't copy those others at school. Read Seventeen and Harper's Bazaar for ideas. Start a new trend, having the followers of your school copy you. Never repeat an outfit. Don't wear the same garment up to 2 weeks. If you do re-wear an outfit don't wear it until a month and several days have past. Have your clique show their style.  , Do not spend all day on Facebook. Your clique doesn't need a useless account on Facebook. Texting is a better form of communication. All have clean reps, you don't want to be notorious as some of the girls from Gossip Girl. IM each other on a specific day. Communicate often to stay in touch.  , You have to have a certain spot you sit in lunch. Have your signature spot, where no one will bother to take since you marked your territory. Sit outside in the sun or indoors. Have a seating order, you all should know what seat to sit in.  , Over weekends and some weekdays the group needs to know where to go. Have an annual event planned. Also when at the mall know where to shop at. The stores should be stores the whole clique can afford and likes. Have a clique member decide what the next trip is. Have the members take turns on where to go. Devote at least 2 weeks in a month to hang out in the weekend.  , Your clique should dress a specific way. Some girl cliques are Preps, which wear Hollister tanks and matching skirts with Vera Bradley knapsacks and purses. Other groups dress emo or scene and shop at Hot Topic. If your clique behaves or act in a certain way make it match with what clothes.  , It's not a hot idea to accept new girls to your cohort. One girl you add can split your clique up. If you do consider adding a new girl make sure you all know her. You have to know how she's like if you do add her.  , The clique should go to a specific house daily. Most likely the leader of the group should hold slumber parties and meeting at her house. Make sure if you are the leader you have a groomed house and room. Don't be messy, especially if you have pets. Be neat and tidy. Provide snacks and yummy refreshments. You don't want your friends starving or dehydrated.  , You want the whole school to know your name, in a good way. You have to be well-known like Oprah or Lady Gaga. You have to be on people's minds. Do amazing things like talent show. Do a hot dance number for talent show with your clique and win. Join the Drama Club and be in the plays with your clique. Apply for clubs and athletic groups.

Remember, power tools are dangerous; always use caution and use adult supervision when necessary. The supplies for the actual base include:2 2”x4” (5 cm x 10 cm) wood pieces, 36” (91.4 cm) long 2 2”x4” (5 cm x 10 cm) wood pieces, 12” (30.5 cm) long 2 2”x4” (5 cm x 10 cm) wood pieces, 23” (58.4 cm) long ¼” (6.35 mm) plywood that is between 20”-24” (50.8 cm – 61 cm) square 1 piece of flat wood (can be plywood) that is 10”-12” (25.4 cm – 30.5 cm) wide and 36” (91.4 cm) long to serve as baseboard 1” (2.54 cm) diameter dowel rod, 15” (38.1 cm) long Two eyehooks; , The plywood needs to be cut into triangles. These triangles will serve as supports to stabilize the trebuchet when it is in use. Using a jigsaw or table saw (whichever is available) cut the square from corner to corner through the center.If you don’t have a table saw or jigsaw, many home improvement stores will cut wood for you before you take it home.  , Measure 13” (33 cm) from the left side of one of the 36” (91.4 cm) long pieces of wood and make a mark. Place the 23” (58.4 cm) long piece of wood perpendicular to the 36” (91.4 cm) long piece of wood on top of the mark that you made.Lay one of the triangle-shaped pieces on top of these supports so that the base of the triangle is aligned horizontally with the bottom of the 36” (91.4 cm) piece of wood and the straight side is aligned vertically with the left side of the 23” (58.4 cm) piece. Hammer nails into each corner and 2-3 nails along each side of the triangle.  , Use the same process detailed above, but make it in a mirror image. This will ensure that when you build the base, both supports will face the same direction and the wooden triangles will face out.When both sides are constructed, line them up and make sure they are identical mirror images of each other.  , Stand the side supports up making sure the triangle wood pieces face out. Place one 12” (30.5 cm) long piece of wood between each side of the ends of the supports. Using the drill, attach the pieces together with two screws on each side.At this point, the base is almost finished. You should have a rectangular base with two vertical supports. The triangles point towards the front of the trebuchet.  , Measure about 2 inches (5 cm) from the top of each arm and drill a hole about 1” (2.54 cm) in diameter. Make sure the dowel rod fits through the holes. If it doesn’t, make the holes larger.You don’t want the hole to be too large because you want the dowel rod to be secure.  , Place the baseboard on top of the bottom of the base. Hammer nails along the edges to secure it in place. You can also screw the baseboard into place if you prefer.Screw two eyehooks into the front end of the trebuchet baseboard about 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart.  , A trebuchet works with a counterweight system. In addition to the materials listed, you will need something heavy to serve as a counterweight. You can use some hand weights, a brick, or a small bucket that you can fill as needed to vary the weight. To build the launching arm of the trebuchet, you will need the following supplies:1 hammer 1 2”x4” (5 cm x 10 cm) piece of wood, 40” (1 m) long About 5 feet (1.5 m) of string A piece of cloth to make a pouch, any cloth, 10” x 6” (25.4 cm x 15.2 cm) Two eyehooks 1 long thin nail with the head removed  , This hole needs to be large enough for the dowel rod to fit through and rotate without friction. Measure 10 inches (25.4 cm) from the top of the 40” (1 m) long piece of wood and make a mark. Make the hole at this 10” (25.4 cm) mark slightly larger than the diameter of the dowel rod (1”, 2.54 cm).Test the rotation by putting the rod through the 2x4. If the 2x4 rotates without resistance, the hole is large enough. This is the back end of the swing arm.  , One eyehook will serve as the attachment point for the string and pouch while the other eyehook will be part of the trigger. Screw the first eyehook into the very end of the swing arm, on the bottom. Screw the second eyehook into the bottom of the swing arm about one inch (2.54 cm) from the end.Hammer the first eyehook into the end until just the loop of the hook is sticking out.  , Make sure that the head of the nail has been completely removed. When the trebuchet launches, the string on the nail needs to be able to fly off the nail and it won’t be able to do that if it gets caught on the head. The head can be removed with a Dremel tool.Hammer the nail into the flat end of the swing arm, approximately in the middle. Bend it slightly forward so that the string will stay on until the trebuchet is launched. The angle of the bend will need to be optimized using trial and error launches.  , You can vary the weight on the back easily by putting more or fewer rocks inside. Drill a small hole into the back end of the swing arm about 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the end. Feed some string through the hole and tie the bucket in place.   You want the bucket to hang vertically down but still be close to the arm. Tie it so that it hangs about 1-2 inches (2.5 – 5 cm) from the top of the arm. Fill the bucket with rocks or heavy pieces of metal. Alternatively, you can attach a heavy weight such as a 20 pound (9 kg) hand weight directly to the end of the arm.  , Trim the corners of the 10” x 6” (25.4 cm x 15.2 cm) piece of cloth so that the shorter edges of the pouch are slightly tapered. This well help contain the object and let it release properly during launch. Make small holes in the middle of the shorter edges.Tie a 27” (68.6 cm) piece of string to one end of the pouch and make a small loop at the other end of the string. Hook the loop on the nail at the end of the arm. Tie a 24” (61 cm) piece of string to the other end of the pouch. Tie the other end of the string to the second eyehook (the one still sticking out of the wood).  , To finish the trebuchet and assemble it together, you will need a coat hanger, wire cutters, and some string. These are the final materials necessary to complete the trebuchet.The coat hanger must be made of wire so you can manipulate it for the trigger. If you don’t have wire cutters, find another tool that will cut through the hanger. You can use as much or as little string as you like for the trigger.  , Position the swing arm between the two supports of the base and slide the dowel rod in place. This will secure the swing arm in place. Without the trigger in place, the counterweight on the back end will cause the arm to stick up.Again, make sure the swing arm can rotate freely around the dowel rod.  , Straighten out a coat hanger and cut a length about 15” (38.1 cm) long. Make a small loop on one end of the wire and attach some string to the loop. Bring the swing arm of the trebuchet down so that the counterweight is in the air. Feed the straight end of the hanger through the first hook on the base, then through the front hook on the swing arm, then through the second hook on the base.Pulling the string, releases the swing arm and launches whatever is in the pouch.  , With everything set up and ready for launch, you can adjust the lengths of the strings attached to the pouch. Loop the end around the nail at the end of the swing arm and straighten the pouch so that it lies directly on top of the baseboard.You want both sets of strings to be approximately the same length and for the pouch to sit close to the end of the baseboard.  , Load the pouch with something round like a tennis ball or baseball. When the cargo is securely in place, stand back and pull the trigger. If the nail is positioned at the correct angle, you should see the ball sail through the air.Alter the angle of the nail as needed to get the best launch distance. Trial and error is the best way to accomplish this. Adding heavier items to the counterweight will allow you launch heavier things and/or launch things a further distance. Don't stand in front of the throwing arm when releasing. It might hit you in the face and cause injury. In early tests, the throwing can be unpredictable; stay clear of all moving parts.

"['use caution with spirulina supplements', 'consider chlorella supplements', 'add algae to your recipes']",How to Add Algae to Your Diet1," While spirulina is being touted by some as a ""miracle"" food, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has not found enough scientific evidence to prove that spirulina is effective in treating any health condition.And though spirulina contains many essential nutrients (calcium, niacin, potassium, magnesium, B vitamins, iron, essential amino acids) it is not known how much of the nutrient your body can actually absorb from spirulina. Spirulina is probably safe for most healthy adults, but if contaminated, it can cause liver damage, nausea, vomiting, thirst, weakness, rapid heartbeat, shock and even death. Carefully research the source of any supplements to ensure they are tested for toxins and are grown in safe conditions.Speak with your doctor, registered dietitian, and/or pharmacist before trying spirulina. Get advice on dosing from your doctor, as there has not been enough testing to establish a safe dose range. People with multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune conditions should not take spirulina. Do not give spirulina to children. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid spirulina. Note that the FDA does not regulate supplements for content, labeling, or safety. Look for products that have been tested by an outside source, such as USP or NSF.; , This fresh-water algae is thought to help with a multitude of conditions, from preventing cancer to treating skin ulcers. It contains protein, fats, carbohydrates, fiber, chlorophyll, vitamins, and minerals. The quality of the product can vary wildly, so it is important that you thoroughly research the source of the supplement before purchasing.Speak with your doctor, registered dietitian, and/or pharmacist before trying chlorella. An appropriate range of doses for chlorella has not yet been established, so consult with your doctor about how much to take. People with multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune conditions should not take chlorella. Do not give chlorella to children. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid chlorella. You can find chlorella supplements in tablet or capsule form. Chlorella supplements can be purchased at most health food stores or online health retailers. Note that the FDA does not regulate supplements for content, labeling, or safety. Look for products that have been tested by an outside source, such as USP or NSF and ask your pharmacist to recommend a reputable brand.  , You may be able to purchase spirulina powder at your local health food store or online. Likewise, you can find nori seaweed and even kelp at many health food and grocery stores. Try picking up some spirulina powder, kelp and nori and experiment with adding these various algae to your recipes.  Add nori to a salad. Simply shred up the algae and add it to a salad recipe. It will add a hint of saltiness to your recipe, so you may not need to add salt to the dressing. Add some kelp or spirulina powder in a smoothie. You may want to also add lemon juice or another citrus flavor with the algae powders because of the strong taste of algae. Experiment with a small amount such as half a teaspoon and work your way up to larger amounts as you become comfortable with the flavor of algae. Sprinkle spirulina on air-popped popcorn for a high-fiber, low-calorie snack. Remember to consult with your doctor before using spirulina.

"['make time every day to have a conversation', 'discuss how to handle conflict', 'be able to discuss sex openly', 'discuss relationship expectations']",How to Start a Conversation With Your Boyfriend3," This doesn't have to be a serious conversation, but you should take time to talk to your boyfriend each day. You can schedule a regular thing, like nightly walks, or just have some time away from the TV each night.   To some degree this should come naturally. If you are having trouble conversing, try going on a quiet date, like dinner or coffee, where your only option is to talk. Simply asking your boyfriend ""How was your day?"" is a great way to open conversation. This is an open ended question that allows him to pick and choose the most interesting bits of his day to share with you. You can plan your talking time around your schedules. If early evenings are always bad, try to talk in the mornings or afternoons.  , Conflict is an inevitable part of any relationship. In order to address conflict correctly, you need to identify how you both handle conflict and figure out ways to deal with disagreements that are mutually beneficial.   People have different styles of conflict resolution. Some people avoid or deny conflict, others become hostile and blame the other person, and some people look at conflict as a competition and try to manipulate the situation to win. Try to be conscious of how you handle conflict. Identifying your method is the first step to adjusting it.You need to view conflict as a shared issue. In a relationship, there is rarely only one party who is in the right. Do not try to get your way every time or minimize and deny what your boyfriend is feeling. Conversely, always giving in to satisfy another person's needs is also damaging. You'll end up harboring feelings of resentment.Your attitude helps in conflict resolution. Go in with the right frame of mind, which means you're approaching the conflict as an issue between two equals. Be respectful when expressing your own feelings and receptive to what your boyfriend is feeling. You both need to make compromises to assure the other party feels secure.Resolving conflict is a process. Start by identifying the issue, discussing several possible solutions, and then mutually deciding which solution, or combination of solutions, is the most viable. Implement the solution and follow up with discussion in a week or two. Evaluate how the solution is working and how you're both feeling about the issue., Sex is a big part of any intimate relationship. Many relationships end due to sexual incompatibility. As you start moving into physical intimacy, be prepared to openly talk about sex.   Many couples feels hesitant to discuss sex, especially if there are issues in regards to their sex life. Feelings of shame and discomfort can halt conversation, but communication is important to a healthy relationship and sex life. Establishing dialogue is important.Find the right time to talk. During sex, people often discuss what feels good in the moment. If you want to have a more detailed conversation about needs and wants, wait until you're not neutral grounds.Talk about any changes in your body, such as hormonal changes or certain medications curbing sexual desire. If your boyfriend does not know what's going on with you, he may interpret changes as a lack of interest. Discuss how to get around such issues together as a couple.Be honest. As you begin becoming intimate with another person, be honest about your wants and needs. Sexual problems become more difficult the longer they go on, so anything that's unsatisfying or makes you uncomfortable should be discussed right away., Every romantic relationship comes with a series of expectations, but there are no universal truths in regards to romance. To maintain healthy communication throughout a relationship, be upfront about your expectations.   Expectations change when we move past the preliminary dating phase. Expectations in terms of time spent together, daily contact, and sex adjust with time. Respecting and accepting change is healthy and normal, and talking about your needs as they arise, is important to maintaining a relationship.Your boyfriend cannot know what you want and need unless you tell him. If you feel uncomfortable without daily communication, even just something small like a text message, tell him this. Your boyfriend might also have different expectations, wants, and needs than you. When you talk to him, try to empathize and respect where he is coming from if disagreements or mismatched expectations arise.Space is another factor in a relationship that needs to be discussed. Your and your boyfriend both need time apart with friends and time to engage in your own personal hobbies. Discuss what you expect in terms of time alone and private time with friends.","['sex', 'time', 'day', 'conflict', 'conversation', 'relationship expectations']"

For example, if your dog has a chronic disease (e.g., diabetes) or multiple health problems, it may take longer for your vet to examine your dog and perform testing. Or, if your vet suspects a new health problem during the exam, your dog may need additional testing during the appointment.   When you schedule the appointment, choose a date and time when you will not have any time constraints.; , When you call the vet’s office, ask if you will need to bring medical documents or samples (fecal, urine) with you to the appointment.If you know ahead of time what you will need to bring, you will be better prepared for the exam.  , Blood work is part of a dog’s annual vet exam. Fasting helps ensure the test results are accurate and not affected by what your dog eats before the blood draw. Also, certain blood tests, like a bile acid test, require a dog be fasted for 12 hours before the blood sample is taken.   Fasting can involve withholding only food or withholding both food and water. If you need to fast your dog, your vet’s office will give you specific instructions on how to perform the fast. A bile acid test is a way to detect liver problems in dogs., Because annual vet exams involve the assessment of many aspects of your dog’s health, the cost of the exam could be high. When you schedule the exam, ask the receptionist for an estimate of the exam’s cost. The actual cost may be different, but knowing an approximate cost beforehand will prevent sticker shock when the exam is over. Approximate costs for an annual vet exam are listed below:Office visit (cost of appointment and physical exam): $45‒$55 Vaccinations: about $20 each Heartworm test: $45‒$50 Fecal exam: $25‒$45 Geriatric screening (for dogs seven years or older): $85‒$110  , For your dog’s annual vet exam, your vet will test your dog’s feces for intestinal parasites. Prior to the exam, you will probably need to collect a fecal sample. This sample should be fresh—less than twelve hours old.A fresh sample will provide the most accurate results, since the eggs and larvae from some intestinal parasites can become unrecognizable in old fecal samples., Although picking up dog poop is never fun, collecting a sample will help you prepare for your dog’s annual exam. Pick up a sample with a doggie bag or a pooper scooper. If you use a doggie bag, turn it inside out so your hand is on the outside of the bag. Pick up a sample, use your free hand to turn the bag right side out, and tie a knot at the top of the bag.Doing it this way will keep your hands from getting dirty.   If you use a pooper scooper, pick up the sample with the scooper and empty the sample into a plastic bag. Tie a knot once the sample is in the bag. It’s okay if you pick up grass, leaves, or other material on the ground when you collect a fecal sample.You do not need to collect a large sample. One or two pieces of feces should be enough.  , If you collect the fecal sample more than twelve hours before your dog’s annual exam, you can keep it fresh by putting it in your refrigerator. First, transfer the sample to a sealable plastic bag. Then, place the sealable bag into another bag to prevent your refrigerator from getting dirty.If you don’t want to transfer the sample to the sealable plastic bag, simply place the doggie bag inside the sealable bag. This way, the sample will still be double bagged, without the mess (and stink) of transferring the sample from one bag to the other. Place the fecal sample as far away from the foods and beverages as possible. After you take the sample out, clean that area of the refrigerator. If the thought of putting dog poop in your fridge doesn’t sit well with you, collect the fecal sample within 12 hours of the appointment and do not put it in your refrigerator.  , As with a fecal sample, a urine sample should be as fresh as possible. Ideally, collect the sample within a few hours of the annual exam. The urine should be in a sterile, sealable plastic container. If you decide to collect the urine yourself, try to stop by your vet’s office before the appointment to pick up a sterile container.   If you are not comfortable collecting the sample, the staff at the vet's office can collect the sample during the appointment. To keep your dog from peeing before the appointment, do not let it go outside unattended and do not let it stop to sniff the bushes when you arrive at the vet’s office., If you are not able to pick up a sterile container from your vet’s office, use a plastic container that you have at home. Make sure it is a container that you do not plan to use again.Examples of plastic containers are empty butter containers or a small food storage container.   Wash the container with soap and water before you use it to collect the urine sample.Let it dry completely. To keep the urine from spilling out, select a container with a lid.  , It will be easier to collect a urine sample when your dog’s bladder is full. Usually, dogs will need to urinate after they wake up in the morning and after they eat. Dogs also urinate during walks or when they exercise.Pick a time when your dog is most likely to urinate.   Having your dog on a leash will also make it easier to collect the urine sample.  , While you are out with your dog, keep a watchful eye on its movements so you know when it is about to urinate. When your dog starts to urinate, slowly and gently position the plastic container in the urine stream, near your dog’s back end. It is important to be slow and gentle so you don’t startle your dog.You will need to collect only about one tablespoon of urine.It’s not a problem if you end collecting up more than that. After collecting the urine and putting the lid on the container, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Don’t worry if your dog stops peeing before you are able to get a sample. The staff at your vet’s clinic can collect the sample during the annual exam.  , If you are not going to your vet’s office within one hour of collecting the urine sample, keep the sample cool by placing it in your refrigerator. It can stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to twelve hours.If you place the urine sample in the refrigerator, keep the container far away from foods and beverages and clean the area after you take the container out of the refrigerator.  , If you are taking your dog to a new vet, bring your dog’s medical paperwork with you to the appointment.Important paperwork includes vaccination history, results of previous heartworm tests and fecal exams, and any treatment your dog has received (e.g., surgeries, treatment for chronic diseases like diabetes). Also, bring paperwork that lists medicines your dog has taken or is currently taking, such as preventative medicines (e.g., flea and tick, heartworm).   The more information you can provide the new vet, the better they will be able to examine your dog and assess its health. If you are going to a vet that has seen your dog before, they will already have your dog’s medical history.  , During the annual exam, your vet will want to know about your dog’s diet. Before the exam, write down everything your dog eats, including treats and supplements. If you occasionally feed your dog table scraps, write that down as well.What your dog eats can affect its health, so your vet will need to know the details of its diet.  , The annual vet exam is a great time to discuss questions and concerns about your dog’s health with your vet.For example, if your dog isn’t moving around as well as it used to, or is getting older and you’re wondering if you need to change its diet, bring up these topics with your vet. The more information you receive from your vet about your dog’s health and wellbeing, the better you will be able to care for your dog.

That's because yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, a bacteria that lives in the vagina and keeps the chemistry there balanced. Lactobacillus acidophilus gets depleted by antibiotics, and eating yogurt restores it and helps to prevent the growth of Candida albicans - yeast.When you buy your yogurt, check the label to make sure it contains Lactobacillus acidophilus in the ingredients list. Not all commercially-manufactured yogurt has it, but most brands do. Either flavored or plain yogurt should be fine. For best results, eat one or two servings of yogurt every day when you're on antibiotics. It doesn't hurt to continue eating plenty of yogurt when you're finished taking them, either, since antibiotics are just one culprit leading to yeast infections.; , Yogurt may be the most popular choice when it comes to replenishing healthy bacteria, but it's far from the only one. Fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, and fermented tea, and more also contain probiotics, the living organisms our bodies need to stay healthy and balanced so that yeast doesn't grow out of control.Because probiotics also help to regulate your digestive system, there are many manufacturers have added them to products in which they wouldn't naturally occur. Cheese, juices, cereal and granola bars enhanced with probiotics can be found in grocery stores. Take probiotics supplements as an alternative. If you're not a big fan of yogurt or sauerkraut, you can pick up a bottle of probiotics supplements instead. These contain the same healthy bacteria as yogurt, this time in the form of pills. Take the recommended dosage throughout the course of your antibiotics treatment.  , Garlic has antifungal properties that help destroy the yeast that leads to infections. Eating plenty of garlic while you're on antibiotics could help keep an infection at bay. Taking garlic supplements is another way to go, and keeps you from having garlic breath for days on end.Some women apply the garlic directly to the vagina when they feel the beginnings of an infection coming on. To try this, wrap a peeled clove of garlic in a small piece of cheesecloth. Tie it off, leaving a tail on the end. Insert it in the vagina with the tail hanging outside the vagina for easy removal. Leave it in for a few hours or overnight, then discard.  , Goldenseal is another natural remedy that many have found helps prevent yeast infections. Before taking this or any other herbal supplement, check with your doctor to make sure it's ok to take it with your other medications., Avoid foods or soft drinks that are high in sugar. Stick with fruit and raw honey if you need something sweet.  , There is limited evidence to support the notion that alcoholic beverages, breads and other foods made with yeast can lead to yeast infections. It won't hurt to limit your intake of these, but it may not necessarily help., Cotton is a breathable material that will prevent extra moisture from collecting. If you love satin and lace underwear, consider changing it out for cotton while you're on antibiotics. If you must wear pretty lingerie, make sure it has a cotton liner.  , Tight pants, pantyhose or elastic undergarments, or materials that don't allow air to circulate around the vaginal area, can cause the area to stay moist - perfect conditions for the growth of yeast.   Wear looser styles as opposed to skinny jeans. Choose a dress or a skirt when possible. Wear loose workout clothing instead of tight workout pants.  , Semen has a different pH than the inside of the vagina, so having sex without a condom can throw things out of balance. If you're willing to change things up while you're on antibiotics, consider using condoms for awhile.  , Even when you're not on antibiotics, douching can lead to conditions in the vagina that promote yeast growth. Douches usually contain chemicals that kill off that good bacteria and leave room for the bad stuff to take over. Douching can also change the pH level in the vagina.   Instead of douching, wash with warm water only. Avoid using harsh soaps or body washes.  , Products with added scents can cause irritation. Don't put perfumes and sprays on your vagina. If you absolutely must add a scent, use a spray made from water and a gentle essential oil, such as a few drops of lavender.  , Tampons can encourage the growth of extra yeast. If you have your period while you're on antibiotics, switch to pads. Just make sure they're unscented, since a chemical-based perfume might irritate your vagina.  , Wipe from front to back to avoid any transfer of bacteria from the anal area to the vagina, which can encourage infection. Make sure your vaginal area stays clean and dry.  , Dyes and fragrances applied to your vagina can lead to the growth of yeast.

"['assess whether the thumb-sucking is a problem', 'watch for triggers', 'ignore it', 'use positive reinforcement', 'cover the thumb', 'distract your child with activities that require two hands', 'remember to engage your child in the process']",How to Stop Thumbsucking1," Thumb-sucking is a normal, natural behavior for many children, and is something they do to comfort themselves and alleviate anxiety. Generally, it will not need correction if it does not continue past 2-4 years of age; most children will give it up before starting kindergarten. However, if you notice any of the following, it might be a problem.   It's causing dental problems- Thumb-sucking can sometimes affect a child's bite, the alignment of their teeth, or the way the roof of their mouth develops. It's causing social problems - Children who suck their thumb may be teased, ostracized or bullied. It's causing medical problems- Persistent thumbsucking can cause the skin on the thumb to shrivel, crack, or chap. It can prevent the nail from growing properly, or even cause infections under and around the nail bed.; , Many children suck their thumb only at certain times, like when they are falling asleep or riding in the car. Others do it for comfort when they're hurt or upset. In many cases, they might not even be aware that they are sucking their thumb. Learning your child's triggers can offer clues as to the best method for helping them stop.  , Children often use behaviors like thumbsucking to get attention from adults; they can also become battlegrounds for power struggles between parents and children. The more you talk about or call attention to the behavior, the more your child will do it. If you suspect this is the case, try to ignore the thumbsucking for a period of time. Give it about a month, and see what happens. Your child may stop sucking their thumb on their own.  , Positive reinforcement is one of the best ways to encourage behavior change in children. Give verbal praise to your child for not sucking their thumb. You could also set up a simple reward system. Put a sticker on the calendar for every day your child does not suck their thumb. At the end of a week with no thumbsucking, give your child a small reward or prize - an extra bedtime story or a small toy. At the end of a month, offer a larger reward, perhaps a special outing. Gradually extend the length of time required to earn rewards.  , A thumb that is covered will not feel or taste the same as a bare thumb, and this is often enough to stop many children's thumbsucking. Try a band aid, a finger cot, a small finger puppet, or a thumb guard. If thumbsucking occurs mainly at night, try putting a mitten or a sock over the hand.  , It's hard for a child to suck their thumb if it's in use. Keep your child busy with art supplies, outdoor play, blocks, puzzles, or anything that requires them to use two hands.  , No matter what method you choose, it will not work if your child does not want to stop thumbsucking. You will meet with much greater success if you are working with a willing participant. Talk to your child about why they need to stop sucking their thumb. Explain your plan and make sure they know what to expect. Ask them what might help them stop; their answers might surprise you.

For a large planter, try something around 24 inches (60 centimeters) long and wide.For a smaller planter, try an 8 by 12-inch (20 by 32-centimeter) rectangle instead.If you can't find any packaging paper, you can also use plain, solid-colored wrapping paper, ""kraft"" paper, or butcher paper.; , Peel away a few inches of contact paper from the backing, and align it with the edge of the packaging paper. Working a little bit at a time, start peeling away the backing and pressing the contact paper down onto the packaging paper.You can use clear contact paper or colored contact paper for some contrast. If you paper is very wide, you may need to add more rows of contact paper. Overlap every row by about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) to prevent leaks.  , You don't have to do this, but it will give the planter some texture. It will also make the paper softer and easier to work with.Once the paper is textured to your liking, smooth it out on a flat surface., Set the paper down, contact-side-up. Orient the paper horizontally, then fold the side edges towards the middle. Overlap them by about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).  Don't worry about creasing the edges of the paper. Don't worry if your paper looks too tall at this point. The next few steps will fix that.  , Lift the top flap up. Run some glue or double-sided tape along the edge of the bottom flap. Press the top flap back down and run your finger along the seam.  Avoid getting any glue inside the planter. A glue stick might work best for this as it won't leak out.  , How far up you fold depends on how wide you want the planter to be. The higher you fold, the wider the planter will be.Plan on folding the bottom edge up at least to the halfway point., When you folded the bottom edge up, you will have ended up with a two-layer pocket. Pull the two layers apart and flatten them, turning the pocket into a diamond-shape with a slit down the middle.You can gently crease the edges of the diamond, but you don't have to.  , Make sure that the corners overlap each other by ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters). Secure them to the bottom of the bag with glue.  You can also place a strip of sturdy tape (ie: packaging tape or duct tape) over the corners instead., Place your hand into the planter and gently push out the bottom until it is flat. Set the planter down on a flat surface. Don't worry if it wobbles around too much., This will add some thickness and dimension to the top band. For a smaller planter, fold it down by only 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). For a larger planter, try 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters).  For a softer touch, roll the top down instead., You can always leave you planter plain if you'd prefer, but a simple word, phase, or image would look quite charming. Choose a spot for the stencil, then flatten the bag. Place a stencil over the bag, then apply some acrylic paint over it. Use a foam brush and a dabbing/tapping motion. Lift the stencil away, then let the paint dry.  If you have neat handwriting, you can write the word using a paint pen instead. If you used colored contact paper, try to match the paint to it.  , Even though the planter is waterproof, you still should avoid getting it wet, so avoid placing it outdoors. If your plant drains a lot, it might be a good idea to place a little dish or saucer under it in the planter as well.  If you don't have a potted plant, you can try filling the planter with soil, and then adding a plant to it. Keep in mind that this is not recommended due to the lack of proper drainage.

Concentrate on doing well in all academic subjects, since this will help you prepare for a criminal science program in college.   Good high school courses for a future criminologist to take include sociology, government, history, psychology, and statistics.Some high schools offer courses in criminology, criminal justice, or related areas.If yours does, be sure to take them. In addition to academics, seek out extracurricular activities to broaden your education and deepen your interests. You could join or start a Criminology Club, for example, as well as participate in common activities like Mock Trial, Debate Club, Math Team, etc.; , Some colleges and universities have degree programs in criminology, but there is no set subject your degree must be in. Whatever your chosen major subject is, make sure to take courses in areas like sociology, psychology, criminal justice, statistics, writing, and computer science.Criminologists enter the field from a variety of academic backgrounds, including:   Criminology Sociology Psychology Criminal Justice  , Work with your school to develop an internship plan that fits your educational and career goals. You might seek internships with:A police department A law office State or Federal government offices Community organizations Research groups  , Earning a master’s degree or even a doctorate can help you gain more advanced positions, greater responsibilities, and higher pay. You can earn a graduate degree in a field such as:   Behavioral Science Criminology Sociology Psychology Criminal Justice  , In other words, even if you earn your degree, you may not be able to practice as a criminologist until you pass the licensure examination.   The specific format of the examination will vary depending upon your location and the agency you want to work for. Expect the examination to be rigorous, however, so study hard beforehand.  , There are a number of organizations serving the field of criminology, such as:   The International Society for CriminologyThe American Society of CriminologyThe Academy of Criminal Justice SciencesThe Law and Society AssociationThe Midwestern Criminal Justice AssociationThe Western Society of Criminology, While you may look for an entry-level position at first, there are usually good opportunities for advancement. However it may be difficult to cross fields. For instance, if you are hired with a state agency, it might be more difficult to later get an advanced job at a federal agency, and vice versa.Criminologists find positions with:   Police departments The FBI State and local governmental agencies Colleges and universities Consultancy agencies  , During the process of being hired for a job in criminology, you can expect to have to pass background and security checks.As participants in the fight against crime, criminologists are expected to have good records and impeccable ethics.  , Your day-to-day work as a criminologist will vary depending upon your specific position and area of expertise. Most jobs in the field, however, eventually involve some combination of fieldwork, analysis, and reporting. For instance:   You might be present at a crime scene, to help gather evidence and determine exactly what occurred. You might investigate how the crime is related to social issues.For instance, you might consider how crimes are related to other problems, such as drug abuse, poverty, and corruption. You might be involved with cataloging information, processing data, and writing reports based on criminal investigations.You might be involved with helping policy makers determine how to respond to and eliminate crime.  , Many individuals trained in criminology wind up working in jobs that do not bear the title “criminologist.” Nevertheless, these careers can be just as fulfilling, and draw on your skills, training, and experience. Job titles of people with a background in criminology include:Border Patrol Agent Compliance Officer Court Administrator Evidence Technician Federal Protection Officer I.R.S. Agent Legal Assistant Penologist  , Attending professional criminology conferences is a great way to network, learn about new developments and issues in the field, and get information about jobs and other important matters. Regular conferences are hosted by many of the major professional criminology associations, such as:   The American Society of CriminologyThe Western Society of CriminologyThe European Society of Criminology  , You can keep up with new developments in criminology by reading current research in journals devoted to the field. If you are interested in sharing research that you have conducted, or want to report on work you have done, you can also try to publish articles in these journals, such as:    The CriminologistThe Journal of Quantitative CriminologyInternational Annals of CriminologyCriminology and Criminal JusticeThe British Journal of CriminologyThe European Journal of Criminology Criminology and Public Policy  , Criminology is a field that is constantly changing as new technologies, methods, and policies are developed. Taking refresher courses even after you complete a degree and have experience working as a criminologist is a good way to keep up with these new developments. Continuing educations courses in criminology may be offered through colleges and universities, professional associations, and governmental agencies. These courses cover topics like:Documentation and forensics Combating cyber crime Promoting crime prevention  , You can also dedicate yourself to gaining expertise in a specialty such as translational criminology, national security, or cyber crime.Working on projects in your area of interest, taking relevant courses, and publishing in the field can all help you gain this expertise. Developing skills in a sub-field of criminology can leader to greater responsibility, recognition, and employment opportunities.

When the frames are played together, the images appear to move. This is the same basic technique used by traditional hand-animators, and is more time-consuming than tweening (See the next section).   By default, Flash will produce animations at 24 frames per second (FPS). That means one second of animation will have 24 frames, but not every frame has to be different. You can adjust this if you'd like, and many Flash animations use 12 FPS, but 24 will produce much ""smoother""-looking animation.; , There are a variety of Flash animation programs available, but the most powerful is Adobe's Flash Professional CC. You can install the trial for free, or you can use another product if subscribing to Adobe's Creative Cloud doesn't appeal to you. The rest of this article will refer to Flash Professional or any other editing program as ""Flash"".  , Because frame-by-frame animation requires multiple images with slight differences, you will need to create all of these assets by hand. You can create them all before you begin, or make them as you go. You can use the Flash program to draw directly in your project, or you can draw your assets in your favorite image creation program.   If you want your images to scale without sacrificing quality, you will want to create them as vectors instead of rasters. Vector images will redraw themselves whenever they are scaled, which means there won't be any pixelation or aliasing. Raster images are the traditional images you're probably used to (photos, Paint images, etc.). These do not scale well, and can look quite ugly if you want to make them larger.  , When you first start Flash, you will have a blank layer and an empty Timeline. As you add frames, your timeline will be populated automatically. You can interact with layers much in the same way that you would in Photoshop.   Before adding your image, create a basic background for your movie. Rename Layer 1 to ""Background"" and then lock the layer. Create a second layer and name it whatever you'd like. This will be the layer that you create your animation on. Add your drawing to the canvas in the first frame. You can either import your drawing from your computer, or you can use Flash's drawing tools to create a drawing directly in the program. Your first frame will be a keyframe. Keyframes are frames that have an image, and form the backbone of your animation. You will be creating a new keyframe each time the picture changes. Keyframes are denoted by a black dot in the timeline. You don't need a new image in each frame. In general having a keyframe every four-five frames will produce a good animation.  , By turning your drawing into a symbol, you can easily add it multiple times in a frame. This is especially useful if you need to quickly create multiple objects, such as a school of fish.   Select your entire drawing. Right-click on the selection and select ""Convert to Symbol"". This will add the image to your Library where you can quickly access it in the future. Delete the drawing. Don't worry! You will be adding it back to the scene by simply dragging the object from your Library. You can add multiple instances of the same drawing to your scene with ease!  , Once you have your first frame ready, you can add your blank frames that will exist between the first keyframe and the second keyframe. Press F5 four or five times to add blank frames after your first keyframe.  , Once you've added a few blank frames, you're ready to create your second keyframe. There are essentially two different ways you can do this: you can copy your existing keyframe and make small adjustments, or you can create a blank keyframe and insert a new image. If you are using art created in another program, you'll want the second method. If you created your art using Flash's design tools, use the first method.   To create a keyframe using the contents of the previous keyframe, press F6. To create a blank keyframe, right-click on the last frame in your timeline and select ""Insert Blank Keyframe"". Anything in your scene will be removed. Once you've created your second keyframe, you will need to make adjustments to the image to give the effect of motion. If you're using Flash's design tools, you can use the Transform tool to select aspects of your drawing and move them slightly, such as the arm of a stick-person. If you're inserting new art for each keyframe, you will want to ensure that it is placed in the same location or in the next logical location on the screen. This will ensure that the art doesn't jump around between frames.  , Now that you've created two keyframes, it's time to iterate. You will be repeating essentially the same process until you are finished with your animation. Add a few blank frames between each keyframe, and ensure that your movements look fluid.Make small, incremental changes. Your animation will look much smoother if you make very small changes to the keyframe. For example, if you want a stick person waving an arm, your second keyframe should not be the other end of the wave. Instead, use a few keyframes to transition from the beginning of the wave to the end. This will produce a much smoother animation.  , Flash contains a function called tweening, which allows you to essentially set start- and end-points for your object. Flash will then move and transform the object based on your settings between these two points, creating the illusion of animation. You will not need to create images for every keyframe like you would with frame-by-frame animation.   Tweening is especially useful for creating ""morphing"" effects, where one object becomes another one over the course of the animation. Frame-by-frame animation and tweening can be used in conjunction in the same movie. You can only have one object undergoing a motion tween at a time. This means that if you want multiple objects to animate at once, they will all need to be on separate layers.  , Unlike frame-by-frame animation, you will not need to create multiple objects to animate using the tween function. Instead, you will be creating one object, and then changing its properties during the tweening process.   Before adding your image, create a basic background for your movie. Rename Layer 1 to ""Background"" and then lock the layer. Create a second layer and name it whatever you'd like. This will be the layer that you create your animation on. It is highly-recommended that you use Flash's built-in design tools or import your image from a vector-drawing program. Vectors can scale easily without distortion, while traditional raster images will not scale and transform well.  , In order to tween your object, you will need to convert it into a symbol. This is the format for objects that Flash uses in order to manipulate them. If you try to tween an object that has not been made into a symbol, you will be prompted to do so first.   Right-click on your object and select ""Convert to Symbol"" The object will be added to your Library, which makes it easy to clone objects., A motion tween moves the object from one location to another Right-click the symbol in your scene and select ""Create Motion Tween"". 24 frames will be added to your timeline, as this is the default length of a tween. Remember, by default Flash will animate at 24 frames per second, meaning that this motion tween will take one second to complete.   When you create the motion tween, you are automatically moved to the last frame of the tween.  , Once you have created the tween, you can move the object to the location that you want it to end up at. Flash will display the trajectory line, which is dotted to show the location of the object for each frame of the tween.   When you first create the trajectory, it will be a straight line from the starting point to the ending point.  , If you ran your animation right now, your object would move along the trajectory, but your background would disappear after one frame. To fix this, you will need to extend your background across all the frames of the animation.   Select your background layer in the timeline. Click the last frame on your timeline, which should also be the frame your motion tween ends on. Press F5 to insert frames up to this point, which will keep your background displayed during the entirety of the tween.  , Adding keyframes to your trajectory will allow you to transform your object during the motion tween. You can only make changes to an object if it is keyframed. To add keyframes to your trajectory, first select the frame in the timeline that you want to turn into a keyframe. Then, click and drag the object into the position you want it to be at during that frame. Your trajectory will adjust automatically, and a keyframe will be added to the timeline. Keyframes are denoted by diamond icons in the timeline.  , To change the path of your object, you can click and drag each of the frame position markers on the path to a new location. Avoid putting to much variation in the path, or the object will move in an erratic fashion (unless this is your goal!)., Once you have your keyframes and trajectory established, you can transform your object so that it changes as it moves through the motion tween trajectory. You can change the shape, color, rotation, size, and any other property of the object.Select the frame that you want the transformation to occur in. Open the object's Properties panel. You can press Ctrl+F3 if the panel is not currently visible. Change any values in the Properties window to affect the object. For example, you can change the hue or color, add filters, or change the scale. You can also use the Free Transform tool to freely change the shape however you'd like.  , Test your motion tween by pressing Ctrl+↵ Enter. Ensure that the transformations look good and that the animation is moving at the correct speed. If your animation is moving too fast, you can either lower the FPS of the scene or increase the tween span.   By default, the FPS is 24, so try lowering it to 12. To do so, click outside the scene and then change the FPS in the Properties panel. Changing it to 12 will double the length of your animation, but may make it more ""jerky"". To change your tween span, select the layer that contains the tween and use the slider to pull it out. If you want the tween to be twice as long, extend it to 48 frames. Make sure to insert blank frames in your background layer so that the background doesn't disappear halfway through the animation. To extend the background, select the layer, click the last frame of the animation in the timeline, and then press F5   , You can add sound effects to actions that occur in your animation to help make it stand out and give it some personality. Music makes your animation more immersive, and can make a good animation into an incredible one. Flash supports a variety of file formats, including AAC, MP3, WAV, and AU. Choose the on that gives you the best quality for the lowest file size.   MP3 will typically give you perfectly acceptable sound quality while keeping the file size to a minimum. Avoid WAV files if possible, as these are often quite large.  , Before you can add sounds to your project, they need to be added to Flash's Library. This will allow you to quickly add them to your project later. Click File → Import → Import to Library. Browse for the sound file on your computer. Make sure that the sound file has an easy to remember name, so you can quickly find it from the menu later.  , This is not strictly necessary, as you can add sound to existing layers, but putting each file on its own layer will give you much more control over fading in and out, when to start and stop, and it is easier to move sounds around.  , On the sound's layer, select the frame in the animation that you want the sound to start at. Press F7 to insert a blank keyframe. For example, if you want to include a music file that plays for the duration of the animation, select the first frame on the music file's layer. If you are adding dialog for a character, select the frame where the character begins talking.  , In the Properties frame, you will see a Sound section. You may need to expand it to see the options. Click the ""Name"" menu and select the file you want from your Library.  , Once you've selected a file, you can configure how it will play. What you select will be based on what you need the sound to accomplish in the animation. You can change the Effect, the Sync, and the Repeat settings of each sound using the menu underneath the Name menu in the Properties frame.   Effect - This lets add effects to the sound, such as fading in and out or adding echo. You can select from preset settings in the drop-down menu, or you can click the pencil icon next to the menu to create your own custom settings. Sync - This determines how the song is played in the animation. Event will play the sound until it is finished. If the same sound is triggered again before the first one ends, the the original will keep playing until it finishes. Start works like Event, but stops if the sound plays again. Stop stops the sound in that frame. If you want to use this in conjunction with other sound properties, create a new keyframe where you want the sound to stop and use this option. Stream will attempt to match the sound that is playing with the number of frames on other layers. This is best used for dialogue. Repeat - This setting allows you to set how long the sound repeats. You can set it to play only once, or have it loop as many times as you want. If your animation is a looping animation, you should set your music to loop infinitely.  , When you are finally finished with your project, save it as an SWF file. This is the format used to play the movie. You can play it in virtually any web browser, or use a dedicated Flash player to watch it. There are also a variety of sites that you can upload it to for others to see, such as Newgrounds, Albino Blacksheep and Kongregate.  , This guide addresses the basics of creating an animation, but there is so much more you can learn and do. Add a few buttons and branching paths, and you've got a choose-your-own-adventure game. You can take a crash course in ActionScript and gain much more control over the finer details of your animation.

You should wait until open house or the first week of school for any less commonplace supplies, but there are some basic supplies you are likely to need regardless of your particular classes:   Pencils Eraser Sharpener Pens Ruler Scissors Glue Sticks (Liquid Glue is not very efficient in class) Colored pencils; , Ensure that it sits comfortably and is not harming your posture. Your backpack should not weigh more than you!  , When you change classes, be organized by ensuring that everything you need is in your backpack or locker.  , So if your first lesson starts at 8:30, the best time to wake up would be an hour to two hours before, in this case between 6:30 and 7:30.  , Have a shower every morning. Uncounted people have failed to survive school because they didn't shower. If you don't have the opportunity to shower in the morning, shower the night before. Even if you don't sweat a lot, it is more hygienic to shower every day/night.  , Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. If you don't have breakfast, you can't concentrate throughout the school day! Some schools also offer breakfasts in the cafeteria.  , If your school is free wear (no uniform) it is best that girls go to school in shorts and pants. Many of difficult situation can be more easily survived in shorts rather than a skirt. However, if you want to wear skirts or dresses, wear leggings or tights underneath. Even if you do have a uniform you can still look yourself. Add some jewelry or change up your shoes and you will look like yourself and still follow the school's rules., Just dress appropriately. You don't want to remember wearing short shorts and spaghetti straps in middle school when you are older. Look your best on picture day. That means that if you school is free wear, don't come in something too sparkly and don't wear a lot of makeup; the light will make you look like the Mad Hatter!  , Even though your teacher may give a lot of homework, just make sure to think positive. School isn't about making you stressed out, it's about teaching you to become a successful adult. Talk to your parents if you feel like you've been stretched to your wits end because of all the work you're getting though. That's not good!  , Pay attention in class. The next thing you know after not paying attention is that your teacher asks you what she or he just said and you have no idea. If you need to, take notes so that you can look back on them for reference.   If you have trouble understanding the homework material then don't be afraid to ask your teacher. Study hard for the exams. The exams in the fifth grade are nothing compared to the exams in the sixth grade. Remember that school comes before fun! Colleges are mostly focused on high school grades, though, but that doesn't mean that you don't have to try now, too. If you do a good job in middle school, it will give you more opportunities in high school, which will help your chance into getting into a good college.  , Nobody in your future will look at your elementary/middle school grades. You're a kid, so relax!  , Be mature when you have to. For example, if you have to care for a parent with a disability or help out with your younger siblings, you need to be responsible.  , Don't take note of what other people are saying about you, unless it's positive. Focus on you, yet have empathy (consider other people's feelings).  , Be nice to people, and don't be mean. Being mean can lead to having no friends, which is not fun. Be friendly and be yourself. Then, you'll make plenty of friends.   Trying out for band is a good idea for you because you learn something new and make new friends.  , Don't take on bullies. You are perfect in every way, so don't fight back!   Understand that you will meet unpleasant people. That's a part of life.  , Having an intimate relationship just leads to heartbreak early. It's ok to have romantic feelings for someone, but don't let it distract you.'  , If they're good friends, they'll last for the rest of your middle school life, so make sure not to lose them!

"['use cash', 'buy a money order with traveler’s checks', 'purchase a money order with a credit card', 'pay with a pin-enabled visa or mastercard gift card', 'purchase a money order remotely']",How to Pay for a Money Order1," Cash is the most widely accepted form of payment for a money order. You can go to any money order provider and purchase a money order with cash. You simply pay for the amount of the money order plus a fee.Companies that issue money orders want the most secure form of payment possible because once they issue the money order, their money is as good as gone. You can also pay with a debit card linked to your bank account. You cannot pay for a money order with a personal check. Checks can take a few days to process. If you don’t have sufficient funds, the money order issuer loses the money.; , The only place you can purchase a money order with a traveler’s check is at the United States Post Office (USPS). You will have to pay for the amount of the money order plus a fee based on the money order amount. When you pay, sign the traveler’s check in front of the postal service worker who is preparing the money order for you.USPS is willing to accept traveler’s checks because they recognize them as a form of cash., Some money order issuers allow you to use a credit card, but not all. You can use a credit card to purchase a money order at Western Union and 7-Eleven. It is expensive to buy a money order with a credit card. Your card issuer will likely view it like a cash advance. This means they will charge you the higher interest rates and fees associated with cash advances. Also, you don’t earn any points or rewards on cash advances, so you won’t earn them for purchasing a money order either., You can pay with one of these cards at Western Union, Walmart, the post office and 7-Eleven. However, doing so is often linked with suspicious activity. For example, some people purchase these pre-paid cards and then immediately liquidate them in order to take advantage of any available rewards the cards offer. Then they deposit the money orders into their bank accounts and use the money to pay their bills. But depositing lots of money orders into your bank account looks like money laundering, and your bank can close your account for doing so., Some companies now allow you to purchase and send a money order online. For example, you can purchase a money order online with Payko and pay with your PayPal account, which is linked to a credit card or bank account. However, you can only purchase a single, $200 money order per day. This method is not as fast as other online bank transfers. Instead of an instantaneous transfer of funds from one account to another, a physical money order is printed out and mailed to the recipient. This can take several days.Sending money over the phone is possible, but this is not the same thing as a money order. You can contact a remittance service like Western Union and request an electronic transfer of funds over the phone. You can pay with a credit or debit card. However, a physical money order is not printed out in this case. Rather, the funds are transferred from your bank account to the recipient’s account electronically.","['credit card', 'checks', 'money order', 'traveler', 'mastercard gift card', 'cash', 'pin-enabled visa']"

A suit’s fibers need recovery time after each wear, otherwise you’re taking years out of its life.Additionally, not wearing your suit daily keeps it clean longer, allowing for more time between visits to the dry-cleaner. If your job requires wearing suits daily, consider the following options:   Investing in an additional suit. Not only will this extend each suit’s lifetime, but it will provide you with additional style options. Should the above not fit within your budget, you can get away with buying a second pair of pants. They usually wear out faster, and having a pair of pants in a different color can give a suit jacket more versatility and style.; , Filling your pockets to the brim will counter your suit’s flattering cut. Bulges and lumps change its overall shape and can stretch out the fabric, leaving it shapeless and deformed.Make it a point to empty your pockets before heading out in your suit, keeping only the essentials with you.  , Travelling with a suit takes some pre-planning, which is particularly important if you’re travelling for a meeting or conference. The last thing you want is to show up in a wrinkled suit. Ideally, you should carry your suit in its garment bag rather than stuffing it in a bag or suitcase. However, it is possible to fold a suit for storage in a carry-on:   Hold the suit jacket upright, pop in one shoulder and pull it inside-out. Tuck the other shoulder into the inside-out shoulder, folding the jacket until the lapels line up. Finally, fold the jacket in half until the top of the shoulders lines up with the bottom of the jacket., This is typically sufficient to keep it clean between trips to the dry cleaner. Brushes aren’t typically much more expensive than $20, and will rid your suit of hairs, dandruff and dirt that it might collect over the course of a day. Just remember to always brush downwards, following the fiber (never across)., It’s entirely possible for your suit to become noticeably stained, though you shouldn’t necessarily rush to the dry cleaner when this happens. Many of these stains can be spot cleaned using non-scented baby wipes.Alternatively, a towel and a bit of water can be used for cleaning tougher stains.  , Unfortunately, your suit will get wrinkled after wearing it, and unlike the rest of your wardrobe, ironing will do more harm than good. A hot iron can damage a suit’s fibers, shortening its lifespan and causing it to lose its shape. Instead of ironing, consider the following options:   You can use a steamer to straighten wrinkles and rid your suit of unpleasant odours between trips to the dry cleaner. Good steamers typically cost around $150 but significantly extend your suit’s lifetime.A neat trick to replicate this without a steamer (eg. while travelling), is to hang your suit in the bathroom and run a hot shower for about half an hour. This will create a similar effect as the steam fills the room. , Cheap, flimsy wire hangers might be enough for the rest of your wardrobe, but a wooden hanger is ideal for hanging your suit. This will ensure it retains its shape, whereas wire hangers tend to cause wrinkles and will even deform the jacket’s shoulders. Additionally, hangers made of cedar naturally repel one of your suit’s worst enemies: moths., Suits are usually sold in plastic garment bags, to ensure they don’t suffer any damage on their way to your closet. However, this is far from a long-term solution: suits shouldn’t be kept in an airtight environment. Plastic garment bags don’t allow the suit to breathe and can tear easily. This can lead to nasty odours and easy access for moths. You can find cloth garment bags rather easily; stores usually sell them if they sell suits. Important things to consider before buying are:   Compare the length of the bag to that of your suit. You don’t want the suit to get bunched up while it’s stored. You can and should be storing dress pants with their respective jackets. Extra features that aren’t needed but can be handy include cedar linings and extra zipper flaps to ward off insects.  , Beyond being sloppy and possibly permanently dirtying your suit, lingering stains and odours make your suit particularly attractive to moths and other insects. Remember not to dry clean your suit more than a few times a year. More than this and you risk damaging it.","['suit', 'chilly holiday party weather', 'iron', 'steamer', 'summer events', 'wide-shouldered wooden hanger', 'rest', 'wool suits', 'wear', 'spot clean stains', 'pockets', 'cloth garment bag']"

Single-letter words in English will be ""I"" or ""a,"" so you should try to plug one in, looking for patterns, and--essentially--playing hangman. If you've got ""a - -"" solved, you know it would most regularly be ""are"" or ""and."" Guess and check. If it doesn't work, go back and try the other options. Be patient and go slowly. Don't worry as much about ""cracking"" the code as learning to read it. Looking for patterns and recognizing the rules in which English (or whatever language is being coded) is written will get you solving the code with some time and effort.; , The most common letter used in English is the letter ""e,"" followed by ""t"" and ""a"". As you're working, use your familiarity with common words and sentence structure to start making logical guesses. You'll rarely feel sure, but the code-breaking game is played by making logical choices and going back and correcting your mistakes.   Watch for double symbols and short words and start solving those first. It's easier to try to make an educated guess at ""an"" or ""in"" or ""at"" than ""highway.""  , If the message includes punctuation, you're in luck. This offers a whole host of other hints that you can learn to recognize. Apostrophes will almost always be followed by S, T, D, M, LL, or RE,AR,BT. So, if you've got two identical symbols after an apostrophe, you've solved for ""L"" or ""D""., If, as you solve, you think you recognize one of the common code types from the above, you've cracked it and can stop your plugging-and-chugging and fill in the message based on your code. This probably won't happen often, but the more familiar you become with common codes the more likely it will be that you'll recognize the sort of code used and will be able to solve it.   Number-substitutions and keyboard codes are especially common among basic everyday secret messages. Keep an eye out for those in particular and apply as you see fit.  , Basically, a substitution cipher involves substituting one letter for another letter, according to some predetermined rule. This rule is the code, and learning and applying the rule is the way to ""break"" the code and read the message.   Even if the code contains numbers, the Cyrillic alphabet, nonsense symbols, or hieroglyphics, as long as the type of symbol used is consistent, you're probably working with a substitution cipher, which means you need to learn the alphabet used and the rule applied to decipher the code.  , The earliest sort of cipher was used by the Greeks, and involved creating a grid of letters that corresponded to numbers, then using the numbers to create messages. It's a simple code to use, making it one of the foundations of modern code-cracking. If you've got a message that includes a long string of numbers, it might have been coded with this method.   The most basic form of this code involved a row 1-5 and a column 1-5, and then filled the matrix in with each letter from left to right and down the grid (combining I and J into one space). Each letter in the code was represented by two numbers, the column on the left supplying the first digit, and the row on top supplying the second. To code the word ""wikihow"" using this method, you would get: 52242524233452 A simpler version of this often used by children involves writing in numbers that correspond directly to the letter's position in the alphabet. A = 1, B=2, etc., Julius came up with a good one, simple to use and understand, but very difficult to crack, making it one of the other fundamental code systems that's still studied today as the basis for more complex codes.In this shift method, you shift the entire alphabet a certain number of places in one direction. In other words, a shift of three spaces left would replace the letter A with D, B with E, etc.This is also the basic principle behind a common children's code called ""ROT1"" (meaning, ""rotate one."" In this code, all the letters are just shifted forward one position, making A represented by B, B represented by C, etc. Coding ""wikihow"" using a basic Cesar shift of three to the left would look like: zlnlkrz  , Keyboard substitutions use the pattern of a traditional American (QWERTY) keyboard pattern to use substitutions, generally by shifting the letters up, down, left or right by a certain number of places. By shifting letters in a particular direction on the keyboard, you can create simple codes. Knowing the directional shift allows you to crack the code.   By shifting the columns up one position, you could code the word ""wikihow"" like this: ""28i8y92""  , In basic substitution ciphers, the writer of the code creates one alternate alphabet to create the coded message. Starting at some point after the Middle Ages, these kinds of codes became too easy to crack and cipher-writers began using various methods to use multiple alphabets within a single code, making the codes much more difficult to crack without knowing the method.   Trimethius's tableau is a 26 x 26 gridof every permutation of Cesar's shifted alphabets, in alphabetical order, or sometimes presented as a rotating cylinder, or ""tabula recta."" There are various methods of using the grid as a code, including using the first row to code the first letter in the message, the second for the second, and so on.Coders will also use a code word to refer to specific columns for each letter of the enciphered message. In other words, if the code word was ""wikihow"" using this method, you would consult the ""W"" row and the column of the first letter in the enciphered code to determine the first letter of the message. These are tough to crack without knowing the code word.  , Breaking codes requires a tremendous amount of patience and perseverance. It's slow and tedious work, often frustrating because of the need to go back and guess again, trying different keys and words and methods. If you want to crack codes, learn to be calm and patient, embracing the mystery and the game.  , Doing the cryptogram in the paper is fun, but jumping headfirst into polyalphabetic codes without the aid of keywords is a whole other level entirely. Learning to write your own codes using complex coding systems is a great way of learning how code-writers think and learning to crack them. The best code-crackers are also good at writing their own and coming up with ever-more challenging ciphers. Challenge yourself to learn more complicated methods and how to crack them.   Analyzing criminal codes and ciphers can be a good way of picking up some tricks of the trade. Bookmakers, drug kingpins, and the Zodiac killer have all developed incredibly complex codes worth looking into., As part of a fun public outreach, the FBI regularly publishes codes for the public to try to crack.Try them out and submit your answers. Who knows--you might have a job soon.   Kryptos, a public statue outside the CIA headquarters, is perhaps the most famous unsolved code in the world. It was originally created as a test for agents, involving four separate panels with four distinct codes. It took ten years for the first analysts to crack three of the codes, but the final code remains unsolved., Cracking codes is like living in your own Dan Brown novel.

"['build up your stomach capacity slowly', 'train with water', 'wet your food', 'train with cruciferous vegetables', 'chew gum to strengthen your jaw muscles', 'do lots of cardiovascular exercise', 'specialize']",How to Eat More Food3," Anyone who's ever been inspired to down as many franks as possible by the Nathan's Hot Dog competition has come up against a quick and harsh reality: you can't eat that many hot dogs without preparation. The stomach is a muscle like any other. It needs training and recovery, otherwise you risk injury. If you want to increase your stomach's capacity, take it slow.   According to some studies, the average human stomach holds about 1.5 liters before becoming nauseated, but can hold between 3-5 liters if trained properly. It is possible to rupture your stomach if you eat too much too quickly, but it's extremely uncommon and rare. You'll usually vomit before you risk a stomach tear or other physical problems., The healthiest way of training and expanding your stomach capacity is not with food, but with water. Competitive eaters are able to drink as much as a gallon of water at a time, in less than 20 minutes. This increases the stomach's capacity and carries relatively little health impact, compared with eating lots of food at once.   Start slow, increasing the number of glasses of water you drink in a day incrementally, then increasing the speed at which you consume the water you drink. It's usually recommended to drink as many as eight glasses of water in a day to begin with, so start there and gradually build up your capacity.  , Water serves a purpose during eating competitions, as well as during your training. While dunking a hot dog bun in water might not seem that appetizing, it helps to break down the food before you put it into your mouth, making it much easier to swallow and start digesting. The faster you get it down, the more you'll be able to eat, and water helps this process.   Don't drink too much of the water while you're eating. While it's ok to use some water to help lubricate the food, don't gulp it to quench your thirst, or you'll be taking up valuable real estate in your stomach.  , Two or three times a week, competitive eater Yasir Salem steams as many as eight pounds of broccoli and cauliflower for a training meal. These vegetables are bland, high in vitamins, and will move through your digestive tract quickly, making them ideal for stretching your stomach easily, combined with a large amount of water.For an added bonus, add a large amount of sauerkraut. Fermented cabbage has probiotic properties that will help keep your intestinal flora in balance, making it an ideal food for competitive eaters.  , Competitive eaters will regularly chew up to six pieces of gum at once, to strengthen jaw muscles and make sure their eating instrument is in good working order. As important as your stomach is to your ability to eat more food, it won't do any good if you can't chew that food quickly and efficiently.   Check out this wikiHow article for neck and jaw strengthening exercises you can incorporate into your routine.  , Ever notice how competitive eaters are generally lean and mean? That's because they're in shape. Contrary to what you might expect, the ability to eat a lot comes from a lot more than a big appetite. Hard training and good cardio are an essential part of being able to eat food quickly and competitively.   Read this wikiHow article for good tips about cardiovascular health. Good breathing is necessary for competitive eaters, as well. Do breathing exercises to make sure you can breathe effectively while you're cramming that food in.  , Not all competitive eaters are alike. Hot dog champions need to train in completely different ways, for completely different amounts, than does a bacon-eating champion, a chili eating champion, or an oyster eating champion. Knowing the specifics of your food of choice will allow you to prepare more specifically.   Major League Eating is the US national organization that governs competitive eating. Check out their website to learn more about joining up and competing.It's very important to meet with a health professional, dietician, or biofeedback specialist to come up with a health and training regimen for the food you hope to consume to keep your body working for you, instead of against you.

This is because they were originally bred to be working dogs tasked with the job of hunting and catching vermin, such as rats.   Consider this side of their character if you have other pets, because the min pin will believe small mammals such as pet rabbits, guinea pigs, hamster or mice are actually prey that need to be hunted down.; , This will shape how you train it. Because the miniature pinscher is a working dog it will think for itself and make its own decisions. This can lead to problems when training the dog, unless you are either totally clear and focussed about how to train or are an experienced dog handler.   If you are a first time dog owner who wants an easy pet that you can cuddle but not invest a lot of time into training, then a min pin isn't the best dog for you.  , Most miniature pinschers have a natural guarding instinct that can make them wary of strangers. This can lead to possible behavioral issues, such as guarding the door or being territorial to visitors.   A miniature pinscher's prowess and bravery in the face of vermin also translates into this attitude to strangers. This means that if the dog feels insecure it is more likely to express that as aggression than as hiding or running away., It is also in the miniature pinscher nature to want to run free and explore. Because of this they are consummate escape artists.   The min pin is adept at dodging between your legs when you answer the door and escaping outside, so you need to be prepared for this. If you have a yard then you need to make sure it is utterly escape proof, as a min pin will seek out the smallest gap or loose fence panel and run away., Miniature pinschers are not an ideal dog if you have very young children. This is because the dog has relatively delicate legs and if rough-housed by a boisterous child, it could result in physical harm to the dog.   Another factor is the min pin's tendency to displays of aggression should it feel threatened. Young children do not always recognize the subtle early warning signs of discomfort that dogs give off. If the child ignores the signs and approaches a fearfully aroused dog, the dog is then more likely to attack.  , Because of the miniature pinscher's suspicion of strangers, it is essential for the dog to be well-socialized as a puppy with all manner of people, dogs, and experiences. If you are getting the dog from a breeder, make sure the breeder has regularly exposed the dog to men, women, and children, and a wide variety of sights, sounds, and smells.It is also best to choose a puppy that has been raised inside the home, rather than outside in a kennel. This will assure that the pup is confident about the noises associated with a house, such as the vacuum cleaner, washing machines, TV, and the general noises people make.  , When you take your puppy home, be sure to keep up this socialization and take your new dog out and about so that it becomes confident it different situations. If the puppy is not yet fully vaccinated and cannot be put on the ground yet, then carry it under your arm or use a small pet carrier, so it can experience being alongside a busy highway or being outside a school when the children are playing.   Lack of socialization and experience can lead to an anxious dog, and in the case of the min pin, this can lead to aggressive behavior.  , These dogs need companionship. They do not do well when left alone for long periods. Make sure your dog has plenty of mental stimulation. Provide it with toys, puzzle feeders, and a stuffed KONG for times when you can't be with it.  , Older children can be taught the body language associated with warning of arousal and so are a better match than young children. Signs that a dog is increasingly outside their comfort zone and about to attack include:   The dog staring directly at the person Excessive yawning. Excessive lip licking. Hunched and cowering behavior, which then becomes more upright with the head raised and weight on the forequarters. Tail held stiffly, but may wag in a slow beat (Not all tail wagging indicates friendliness). Raised hackles or hair on the dog's body. Snarling, raised lips, and growling.  , The independent mind of the miniature pinscher means you need to be prepared to give firm, fair, and consistent training so that it takes you seriously. Reward-based training methods, especially clicker training is appropriate because this rewards the dog's good behavior while minimizing its levels of stress or anxiety.  , Teach it all the basic commands, such as sit, stay, and lay down. Be prepared to train your min pin twice a day for 10 - 20 minutes at a time, depending on the level of its concentration.   Always end the session on a positive note, so if its attention is wandering, give it a simple command, such as ""sit"" and reward when it does it. Then resume the session another time.  , In light of the min pin's love of running away to explore, it is vital to teach the dog to come back to you on demand. This will allow the dog to have some freedom to explore without a huge risk of it running off.   Remember the vital rule that if it gives you the run around and takes a long time to come back, never vent your frustration on the dog. To do so only teaches the dog that it is punished when it comes to you. This will make the dog less likely to listen next time., The dog should have a safe den to retreat to when strangers come in your home or when it needs alone time. Again, do this training with rewards, so treats in the open crate and feed the dog in the crate, so that it associates the crate with positive experiences.   Never use the crate as a prison or punishment for the dog, since this will stop it from thinking of it as a safe place and defeats the idea behind a crate.  , The miniature pinscher is an active dog but does have a tendency to put on weight. Taking care of your min pin means feeding it responsibly so that it is neither under or over weight.   You should be able to identify the bones of the dog's ribs by feel, without pressing fat out of the way. Likewise it should have a tucked up waist when viewed from the side, and a curve in at the waist when viewed from above.  , The food should list a named meat as the main ingredients (the first one to three ingredients on the label). Consult with your vet about good brands to feed your dog.   Don't forget to give your min pin access to water at all times. A clean source of water is important for all dogs.  , The min pin is a deep-chested breed which means it is at risk of bloat and gastric torsion, which is a life-threatening condition. To reduce the risk of GDV (Gastric dilation and torsion) always leave at least 90 minutes between feeding and exercise., The min pin has a short coat that needs minimal grooming, although regular brushing is always a good idea. It stimulates the circulation to the skin and coat, and helps condition it.   Brushing also helps bond you and the dog, promoting a strong relationship.  , The min pin's short coat and lack of body fat mean that it does feel the cold. Thus, in colder weather it will appreciate a jacket and make sure it has a warm bed to snuggle into at night.  , Being a responsible owner and caring for your miniature pinscher means having regular check ups with a veterinarian to make sure it is healthy. Annual vaccinations are also recommended, including against rabies.   Your vet can advise about which diseases are prevalent in your area, and therefore which to vaccinate against. Also use preventative healthcare, such as parasite control and deworming, as advised by your veterinarian.  , If your dog is a pet, rather than a breeding animal, then consider desexing it. It is best to get a dog ""fixed"" before it is 6 months old.This will help eliminate the risk of some diseases, such as breast cancer in female dogs, and it will help the overall behavior of your dog, whatever its sex., They are a pedigree dog, which means there are certain genetic conditions that are statistically more likely to occur in this breed than other breeds or a mixed parentage dog. These conditions include Legge-Perthes disease (a hip problem), luxating patellas (a kneecap problem), under active thyroid glands, and epilepsy.These problems can be corrected or managed, but the costs involved can be large. Either make sure you have the financial capacity to cope with the unexpected or take out a pet insurance policy.

As you want to keep antique furniture as damage-free as possible, harsh chemicals are a bad idea. A mild dish soap diluted in water is a safe choice for most antiques. Use dish soap intended for hand washing dishes. Soap that you would use in a dishwasher is more acidic.If dish soap is not successfully removing grime, it's okay to opt for a slightly stronger cleaner. Something like Murphy's Oil would work, but use only a small amount. You should not use an abundance of oily products on older furniture.Some experts feel furniture paste wax, which you can find at most hardware stores or department stores, is a better option for cleaning antiques than oil.; , To start, wet a rag with a light amount of your chosen cleaner. Gently rub down the surface of the furniture. Keep wiping the surface with the same rag until the rag no longer picks up new dirt or debris.Avoid scrubbing, as this can damage the finish of old furniture. Use gentle wiping motions instead.Move the rag in the direction of the grain of the wood.  , Some areas may have stuck on stains or grime. You can use steel wool to remove these stains as long as you use #0000 wool and work at the stains using gentle motions.Rub in the direction of the wood grain. Keep rubbing until the unwanted dirt and debris is gone. Make sure not to use too much force. This can damage the finish.  , Some areas in the furniture, like corners or curves, may be hard to reach with a rag. For these areas, use a toothbrush. Dip a toothbrush in your cleaning solution. Following the grain, scrub down hard-to-reach areas until dirt and grime is gone., Once you're finished cleaning, you can wipe down the furniture with a dry rag. Use gentle motions to sop up most of the liquid until the furniture is relatively dry to the touch. Allow the furniture to air dry a bit before continuing with the cleaning process., Once the furniture is dry, add a layer of polish. This will make the finish glow and give the furniture a nice look. To polish, simply take a clean cloth and buff the furniture until it glows.Furniture polishes, especially silicone-based polishes, are best avoided on antiques., To prevent the buildup of grime, dust your furniture regularly. When doing routine dusting in your home, take a rag and dust off any debris built up on antique furniture.   If you're using dusting sprays, go for a mild spray or no spray at all on antiques.  , UV light is very damaging to antiques. Therefore, it's a bad idea to allow your antiques to be exposed to sunlight.Do not leave antiques outside, especially in shaded areas. Do not store antiques near a window, where they may be exposed to sunlight from outdoors.  , Antique furniture is affected by moisture in the air. Changes in humidity can cause wood to shrink and crack. Keep a humidifier in the room where you store your antiques. This will keep the humidity stable, minimizing the negative affects of changing in moisture in the air., Antique furniture can be very valuable. Therefore, it's a bad idea to allow it to be exposed to pests. Certain types of bugs, like beetles, as well as rats and mice will chew through antique furniture. In the event you notice a pest infestation in your home, remove antique furniture right away. Store the furniture elsewhere until the infestation is resolved.Check for any loose or damaged bits before moving antique furniture. You should not carry furniture in areas that are wobbly or dislodged. Carry chairs by the seat rails. Carry tables by the apron or legs. Always drag furniture, especially large furniture, across the floor instead of dragging it.  , If you have an antique that's pricey or a collector's item, do not attempt to restore it on your own. Talk to a local antiques dealer and ask for advice or tips. If you're not familiar with restoring furniture, you may want to hire a professional instead of attempting to restore an antique on your own., You want to make sure your chosen cleaner will not harm your antiques. Test a small amount on a tiny area of the furniture that is not easy to see, such as underneath the seat of a chair. Wait a few hours and check. If you do not notice any damage or discoloration to the furniture, this cleaner is probably safe to use., Murphy's Oil, when diluted, is usually safe to use on antiques.However, with very old wood furniture, opt for wax over oil-based products. Wax-based cleaners are a better option, as wax will serve to protect wood as well as clean it., It's common to notice old or chipping paint on antiques. Your first impulse may be to remove such discolorations. However, this is a bad idea and may negatively affect the value of your furniture.Collectors usually want antiques as close to original as possible, including any chipped or stained paint. If you're intending to one day sell your antiques, you should especially avoid altering the paint.

"['identify the signs of vomiting', 'reduce nausea', 'try to plan your location', 'prevent personal mess', 'clean yourself up', 'rehydrate your body', 'avoid unpleasant odors', 'limit your food intake', 'abstain from alcohol', 'know when to seek help']",How to Vomit Without Making a Mess," Vomiting may come on suddenly, but many people experience symptoms of illness that precede the act of vomiting. Rush to a bathroom, garbage can, or a safe outdoor area if you experience any of the following:   dry heavesthe sensation that you're about to vomit abdominal paincontraction of the stomach musclesdizzinessother stomach ailments, such as diarrhea; , If you're very sick, overly intoxicated, or experiencing food poisoning, you're going to need to vomit no matter what you do. But if you're only experiencing mild nausea, there are some steps you can take to reduce or prevent the need to vomit. Try the following options to manage your nausea:step outside and get some fresh air take deep, slow breaths through your mouthsuck on a mint candy or chew gum smell the inside of your wrist or armpit (the smell of perfume or deodorant may distract your body from the sensation of nausea) sniff something scented, like essential oil pinch your arm or tug on your hair (physical sensations can sometimes distract the body)  , If at all possible, try to anticipate when and where you will vomit if the need arises. The most ideal place is in a rest room (in the toilet, if possible), but obviously that may not always be feasible to get to a rest room. If you cannot get to a restroom, try to at least find a plastic bag or trash can to vomit into, as this will greatly reduce how much of a mess you make.If you're going to induce vomiting, wait until you can get to a toilet, trash can, or plastic bag. If you believe that you may vomit uncontrollably in the near future, stay close to a bathroom or keep a trash can/plastic bag on hand.  , Once you've eliminated the potential for making a mess of your immediate environment, your next focus should be on keeping yourself clean. Whether you've made it to a bathroom, found a trash can, or stepped outside to a safe outdoor environment, you'll want to prepare yourself as best you can for what's about to happen.   If you have long hair, tie it back, tuck it behind your ears, or hold it in place behind your head. Vomit in your hair will quickly ruin your night and make an absolute mess.Remove any long, dangling necklaces, or at least tuck them into your shirt. This could create a similar complication as long hair. Try to direct the stream of vomit away from your shoes, pants, and hands (if you're on all fours). Aim slightly ahead of where you're standing/sitting/crawling. If indoors, keep your head above the toilet or trash can. Try to lower your head enough that no vomit will splatter outside the container you're vomiting into. If you're sick in bed, keep a trash can and a stack of towels next to the bed. That way, if you can't reach the trash can or make it to the toilet, you can put down a towel to vomit onto/into. The towel can easily be washed, and it will be much easier to clean up than if you threw up in your bed or on the carpet., After vomiting, you will probably feel sick and a little disgusted. This is normal, as vomiting can be extremely stressful on the body and leaves a revolting aftertaste in the mouth and throat. Even if you managed to complete the actual process of vomiting without making a mess, you'll want to clean yourself up after throwing up to feel better and cleaner.   Brush your teeth, or at the very least rinse your mouth out. Using mouthwash is best, but in a pinch even water will help.Splash some clean, cold water on your face, and wash away any residual vomit that may have clung to your lips, chin, or facial hair. Suck on a breath mint or chew gum to ensure that your breath does not smell.Wash your hands with soap and water., No matter what the cause of your vomiting was, your body will most likely experience some mild to moderate dehydration after you vomit. That's because your body loses water and nutrients any time you vomit.   When you feel that you will not vomit anymore and you think you can stomach it, slowly drink a glass of cold water. Do not chug the water or attempt to drink it quickly - just sip on it slowly and steadily.If you can keep water down, try drinking a little bit of a sports drink or other electrolyte-rich beverage (such as Gatorade, Powerade, or Pedialyte).Do not try to eat any food until you are feeling completely recovered. Let yourself sit and relax for a few minutes after vomiting. Avoid any immediate activity, and focus on getting rehydrated and letting your body calm down., Smells can trigger nausea in many people. For some, even the smell of certain meals being prepared or eaten may induce nausea/vomiting.If you are prone to vomiting, or if you are feeling nauseated and want to avoid vomiting, stay clear of any kitchen areas where food is being prepared or eaten. You may also want to avoid other unpleasant odors, such as bathroom odors or the smell (or sight) of someone else vomiting.  , For many people, overeating is a cause of nausea and/or vomiting. If you are prone to bouts of nausea, or if you know that the size of your stomach has shrunk, it's best to avoid eating too much or eating too quickly to help ensure a calm, stable stomach.Try eating multiple smaller meals throughout the day instead of one or two really large meals.Eat bland foods. Avoid sweet, spicy, fried/greasy, and acidic foods, as these are known to cause stomach problems. Avoid milk and dairy products. You may also want to avoid carbonated drinks, as these may upset some peoples' stomachs., Drinking in excess is a major cause of nausea and vomiting. Even if you don't tend to drink in excess, some people who are prone to stomach problems may become nauseated after consuming even moderate amounts of alcohol. It's always best to moderate your alcohol intake, but if you know drinking will make you vomit, you may be better off avoiding it altogether., If you've eaten too much, drank too much alcohol, or have a fever, vomiting is a somewhat normal reaction your body is having to the contents of your stomach or the presence of a virus. However, sometimes nausea and vomiting are indicative of more serious medical problems, and should be closely monitored.

Email your hosts or message them through your booking agent and ask:   Who are the people who live in the house? How old are they? What languages do they speak? Will there be other boarders in the house or on the property? Who, exactly, will be there during my stay?  , The last thing you want to encounter on your excursion are accommodations that are not what you expected. Before you book your travel homestay, email your host or send them a secure message through your booking agency or site. Questions you should ask include:   What type of shower is in the home? Does the shower have hot water? Where is the toilet located? What type of heat does the home have? Does the home have air conditioning? Does the home have fans? Are there animals on the property?  , Before you solidify your travel plans, you will want to ask important questions about where you will be sleeping. Getting a better picture of sleeping arrangements can help you decide if a particular homestay is a good fit for you. If possible, request your hosts send you photographs. Email your hosts and ask:   What type of room will I be sleeping in? Will I be sharing the room or will it be private? Whom will I be sharing a room with? What type of bed will I be sleeping on? Do I need to bring my own bedding? Is there a secure place in the room for my belongings?  , Before you decide on a travel homestay, take the time to ask your hosts important questions about the meals you will be eating while staying with them. This is especially important if you have special needs, such as food allergies or dietary restrictions. Email your host family and ask:   Are meals included in the homestay? Can specific dietary needs be accommodated?  , While you are residing at your travel homestay, it is important to identify ahead of time what your access to communication via phone and/or the Internet will be. Do not assume that there will be Wi-Fi on site simply because your host is using the Internet to book your homestay. Contact your host and ask:   Is there Internet access in the home? Will I have access to a phone in the home? If I won’t have access to phone or Internet in the home, where is the nearest place I can access each and how would I get there from the home?  , It’s important to know how close your potential travel homestay is to transportation. Contact your host and ask specific questions about where the homestay is located in relation to bus, train, and air transport. Questions to ask include:   How close in the nearest bus stop? How far away from the home is the airport? Do taxis come near the residence? How long does it take to walk to the train or bus station?  , After you book your travel homestay, make sure you stay in communication with your host. This is especially important in the weeks and days leading up to your arrival. You will want to make sure you have a way on contacting your host once you arrive at your travel destination in case any issues arise.

"['if you notice something suspicious', 'contact your boss', 'use anonymous feedback/complaint systems', 'gather information carefully', ""but don't be overzealous"", 'avoid impulsive accusations']",How to Catch Someone Stealing at Work3," As an employee, you don't have the same sort of power that your bosses do when it comes to making big, structural changes to your company in an effort to stop workplace theft. However, this doesn't mean you can't be an immense help. If you see, hear, or otherwise observe anything that makes you think theft is taking place, talk to a supervisor immediately. Don't stay silent — keep in mind, according to many workplace's rules, allowing another employee to steal can mean implicating yourself in the crime.   At many workplaces, especially ones where there is a major gulf between low-level employees and the management staff or where the employees are unhappy with their jobs, there may be a ""culture of silence"" surrounding the act of workplace theft — that is, thieving employees expect others to cover for them and may use bullying or shunning to punish employees who speak out. In this case, don't ruin your relationship with your fellow employees by going directly to a boss while you're at work. Instead, contact your boss via email, over the phone, or with one of the anonymous methods below.  , Unfortunately, at some workplaces, it may be ill-advised to earn yourself a reputation as the sort of person who reports workplace theft. In this case, try to report the theft anonymously. This way, the management can deal with the theft, but other employees won't be able to trace your actions back to you.   Options you may want to consider include:  Slipping an anonymous note under your boss's door Writing information on an anonymous feedback card Sending your boss an email from a ""throwaway"" email account (one that you make and use only once) Meeting your boss outside of work to discuss the problem    , If you see an opportunity to document an act of workplace theft with your own notes, pictures, or video footage, you may do so, but be careful. If the employee committing the theft notices you documenting him, he'll probably stop immediately and won't act out around you again, potentially making it harder for you to prove that he's stolen in the long run. In a worst-case scenario, you may even find yourself labeled a ""snitch"" and have your relationship with the other employees damaged.   Note that, often, it's enough to make a mental note of when and where the theft occurred and who was involved. If your boss considers you to be trustworthy and your information matches discrepancies in your employer's records, your boss may have enough information to act on even without pictures, videos, or other extra evidence.  , Employees have a duty to talk to their employers if and when they have information relating to workplace theft. However, they should not accuse other employees of theft when there isn't any sort of conclusive evidence to support their claims. In addition, even if there is evidence that an employee has been stealing, they should not attempt to humiliate the thief in front of other employees or customers.   Not only can these sorts of unsupported accusations be very embarrassing if they're proven wrong, but they can also have a negative effect on company morale by promoting a feeling that employees are subject to ""witch hunts"" at a moment's notice.

"['try typing in song lyrics', 'present cleverbot with a logical paradox', 'ask cleverbot to play games with you', 'type a sappy romantic dialog for cleverbot', 'ask cleverbot to do math problems', 'talk to cleverbot about supernatural things', 'talk to cleverbot about famous people', 'talk to cleverbot about other websites']",How to Confuse Cleverbot1," Compared to other computer programs, Cleverbot is an exceptionally skilled conversationalist. However, Cleverbot knows nothing of the joys of music. If you try typing in a few lines of your favorite song lyrics, most of the time, Cleverbot will interpret the lyrics literally or give a nonsensical response, even if the lyrics are well-known.   Note, however, that for certain songs that are very well-known, Cleverbot actually can (and will) recite the song lyrics if you start typing them in. For instance, try typing in the opening lyrics to Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"": ""Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?""; , A paradox is a statement, question, or idea that has an answer that can't be logically found. Since some of history's greatest thinkers have struggled to untangle logical paradoxes, it's a very safe bet that Cleverbot will be completely perplexed by most of them. In addition, Cleverbot doesn't even do well talking about subjects that have the potential to be paradoxical, like time travel. Try using some of the paradoxes below, or use a search engine to find your own — there are literally hundreds out there.“If this statement is true, then Santa Claus is real.” ""Since we haven't been visited by people from the future, does that mean that time travel will never be possible?"" ""What would happen if Pinocchio were to say, ""My nose will grow right now?"", Cleverbot isn't terribly playful. For instance, if you ask it to join you in a game of chess or checkers, it'll say ""OK"", but then if you say, ""You go first,"" you'll get a nonsensical response. This is probably due to the fact that Cleverbot doesn't really have the capacity to play games — it knows to say that it wants to play chess with you, but it has no idea how to actually play chess.   Cleverbot can, however, play rock paper scissors. Try it — say ""Let's play rock paper scissors"" and then say either ""Rock"", ""Paper"", or ""Scissors"".  , Sooner or later, almost everyone casually messing around with Cleverbot will get the idea to jokingly express the love or attraction they feel towards it. Though Cleverbot can handle basic overtures of love like ""I love you"" and ""Marry me"", it's not so good at interpreting subtle romantic comments or come-ons. For people nursing a crush on Cleverbot, a direct approach is apparently best.   Give it a shot — try feeding Cleverbot pickup lines like ""I don't have a library card, but do you mind if I check you out?"" The response you get will usually be a little confused (at best) (if you use the library card line, you'll get ""I can say anything."")  , You might think that, because it's a computer program, Cleverbot would be able to do math problems almost instantly. In fact, for some reason, Cleverbot is terrible at doing math, even when the problems you ask it are very simple. It shouldn't take you long to get a confused response out of Cleverbot with this strategy.   Sometimes, you'll even get different responses if you switch between using numerals and spelling each number out. For instance, asking ""What is 200 times 2?"" gets you the answer ""4,"" while asking ""What is two hundred times two?"" gets you the answer, ""A number.""  , Cleverbot doesn't have good old-fashioned human common sense, so it doesn't have a good grasp on what's real and what's not. Talking to Cleverbot about monsters, aliens, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena is likely to confuse it. You can also confuse it by bringing up some religious or spiritual topics, even if they're quite well-known.   You can even use the subjects of modern-day ghost stories to the same effect. For instance, if you say, ""Have you ever been visited by Slenderman?"", Cleverbot will respond with, ""My life is a lie?!""  , Cleverbot knows nothing about politics or celebrity gossip. Asking Cleverbot about its opinion on a famous person or public figure will almost always confuse it. For example, asking, ""What do you think about Brad Pitt?"" will get the answer, ""I think he si (sic) a great president, he'll change the states.""   You may also want to try talking about the different things famous people have done — Cleverbot isn't terribly smart about these things either. For instance, typing in ""What do you think about the president's social policies?"" will get you: ""I think he isn't the president anymore.""  , Cleverbot does not understand other websites and will respond with something weird. Try talking about wikiHow and see what happens.

For the size in the illustrations, an eight foot (2.4 m) long board and some odd scraps were used., Two saw horses and a sheet of plywood works fine, but a heavy workbench would be better., There are some rabbetsto cut for joining the corners, and a sharp blade will make this process much easier., Here, the end pieces are cut 8 3/8 inches (21.3 cm), to the short point, with each end cut on a 7 degree angle so the sides of the chest will be slanted. Mark each cut on one piece of lumber, then cut them carefully. Use the first piece as a pattern to cut the second, or measure and mark it exactly, if you prefer., Make sure one end of the board is square, then measure 16 inches (40.6 cm). Make your mark, then scribe a straight line across the board using a framing square. Cut these carefully, as well., You can use the end boards to scribe the cuts as shown in the photo, or measure 3/4 of an inch (1.9 cm) and square this line. Cut 2/3 of the thickness of the lumber deep. Here, we are using a nominal one by board, 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) thick, so we set the saw to cut 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep.,, We used a carpenter's grade hot melt wood glue, but these joints may be nailed or screwed, or fastened with conventional wood glue. Make sure all edges are flush and true, and try to keep the corners as square as possible. A jig will help if you are having difficulty aligning and squaring the pieces., Using the dimensions of the chest shown, the bottom will be 14 1/2 inches (36.8 cm) by 7 inches (17.8 cm), but checking the actual assembled size will provide a better fit. Cut the bottom out of a piece of your lumber, the size you have measured, with the saw blade set on a 7 degree bevel on the long sides so it fits the tapered sides of your chest., If it is cut correctly, you may need to tap it into place, since the tapered edges will seat firmly into the bottom., Cut 3/8 inch deep around the top of the box, 3/8 inch from the outside edge. This will form a recess for the lid to set down on, creating a somewhat better seat for the lid to set in, If you are using wide lumber, as in the photos, you can rip it in half to reduce waste. Mark a radius from the edge to form the curved shape of the top of the chest. Here, we used the lid from a five gallon bucket, which provided an ideal curve with little effort., These two pieces should be as closely matched as possible to make fitting the finished lid easier., Here, a vise or clamp is very helpful, since the stock you are cutting is almost impossible to hold safely while you cut. When the two ends are cut and rabbeted, you can temporarily attach them to the chest to make fitting the lid slats more simple. Here, again, hot melt glue makes this quick and simple., Make sure they are at least as long as the length of the chest, but ripping longer boards and then cutting several to length from each rip will save time., If you have attached the lid ends to the top of the chest box, you can simply scribe them in place. Glue these, starting on each side and the center of the top, to keep the assembly square and true. Fit the edges as tightly as possible, but because of the radius of the lid, you can expect a noticeable gap unless you choose to bevel each piece individually. You can leave these strips overhanging each end slightly by cutting them 1/4 inch (.6 cm) long, then after attaching them, the ends can be sanded flush., Clean up the edges, light sand the surfaces, and bevel corners and other features that may produce splinters or leave a sharp edge., These will act as bands, and help secure the lid slats to the box, but for all practical purposes, they are ornamental. Test fit these strips and scribe the ends, then cut them to length. Make sure they are sufficiently thin and limber to bend the radius of your lid without splitting or cracking. Attach them with glue or tacks., If you want to stain or paint the chest, now is the time to do it, before the hardware (hinges, handles, and the hasp) is installed., Since this project was started with stained hardwood, and no matching stain was available, brown spray paint was used to blend the colors of the original stain, giving a pretty good finish., Here, antiqued cabinet hinges and pull handles were used to add to the rustic effect. The hardware can be attached with the Hot Melt glue so it can be test fitted, or you can simply attach it with the screws provided in the set you buy. Be sure to check the operation of hinges before completing installation, since if they are not correctly aligned, they will likely bind or cause the lid to fit crookedly.","['circular saw', 'lid', 'preference', 'top', 'size', 'cuts', 'radius', 'chest', 'first piece', 'rabbet cuts', 'rip strips', 'box', 'degree angle', 'side boards', 'complete cover', 'table', 'overlay', 'cut square', 'length', 'assembly', 'opening', 'sides', 'end boards', 'front', 'line', 'strips', 'edge', 'width', 'ends', 'thin strips', 'lumber', 'end', 'pieces', 'jigsaw', 'saw', 'tools', 'pattern', 'bottom', 'cm', 'corners', 'board', 'vise', 'inches', 'hardware', 'wood', 'finished side', 'rear edges', 'rabbet', 'edges', 'mark', 'inch', 'work table', 'sharp blade', 'additional strip']"

Add a bit of crushed or milled flaxseed to your horse’s food.You should discuss this with your veterinarian or herbalist before beginning supplementation. You will want to provide 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of flaxseed per every 1,000 lbs. (454 kg) of your animal’s weight, per day.; , Neem oil is an essential oil extracted from the neem tree. It has a solid consistency (when cold) and a strong smell. It acts as an excellent natural insecticide. Warm the neem oil in your palms and apply to your horse’s neck. Leave this on for at least one hour, and shampoo off.You can double your efforts by using a natural insecticide shampoo.  , Sweet foods—molasses, sugary feeds, some spring grasses, and sweet treats—have been shown to exacerbate the conditions of sweet itch. (Some believe this is where the name Sweet Itch is derived). These foods should be strictly avoided in your horse’s diet., In order for your horse’s lesions to heal, you must attempt to quell the itch. Apply aloe, lavender oil, or wild germanium oil directly to your horse’s skin, or dilute essential oils in a carrier oil (such as coconut oil).Avoid applying essential oil to broken skin.  , You might also be able to help prevent sweet itch by feeding your horse certain foods. The idea is to change the smell of the horse’s sweat so that midges aren’t attracted – and won’t bite.You might try mixing adding apple cider vinegar to the horse’s feed, for instance. Also try feeding the horse two tablespoons of garlic powder twice a day.  , Anti-histamines created for humans have been shown to reduce symptoms of Sweet Itch in horses. However, this can be cost-prohibitive due to the large doses needed for a horse.Discuss this option with your veterinarian to determine the proper dose for your animal.  , Cortico-steroids (administered by your vet) have been shown to be extremely effective at suppressing the immune response that causes Sweet Itch. This relieves the itch and helps your horse’s lesions to heal.The use of steroids can make horses more susceptible to Laminitis. As such, this method should be explored only in severe cases, or when other methods have not worked.  , A company called BioEos has created a capsule-based treatment that helps to correct the immune response. This capsule has been shown to cause a 50% improvement in 70% of horses with Sweet Itch.Discuss this option with your vet.  , Sweet Itch can induce violent scratching responses in your animal, leading to painful lesions and wounds. If the Sweet Itch lesions have created an infection, antibiotics may be needed to treat the problem, and help quell the itch.Once again, this is an issue to discuss with your vet.  , Dawn and dusk are the times of day when midges do their feeding. You can reduce your horse’s exposure to these biting insects by stabling them during these times, especially from about 4pm to 8am. Prevent midges from entering your stable by closing any doors and windows and/or ensuring screens are in place., The use of fans inside your stable is another great way to naturally repel the insects and help keep your stable midge-free. Midges can’t fly or land in strong breezes – anything over 5 mph is too much for them. It’s best to direct fans to the locations on your horse where midges tend to populate, such as around the neck and tail. This may require several fans., When you have rotting vegetation, manure, or standing water in or near your stable, you are creating an ideal environment for midge infestation.You can reverse the situation by:   Remove any rotting vegetation, such as leaves or hay. Get rid of any puddles or standing water nearby. Dispose of any horse droppings in your yard.  , “Barriers” may include sweet itch rugs, blankets, masks, and hoods. These garments protect your horse from midges (preventing further bites) while also preventing your horse from scratching and causing damage (or even infection). Sweet itch barriers are an excellent preventative measure, and they can also enable your horse to heal.It is important to keep rugs, blankets, and hoods clean and free of midges. If possible, it is best to have two of each barrier method you choose, so that you can use one while the other is being washed.  , You may be able to help control the midge population in and around your stable by way of regular fly or insect traps. This may include things like glue strips, insect zappers, and/or catch and release traps. Install any of these devices outside or inside your horse stable to help keep the midges away from your horse., Midges breed in low-lying, wet areas such as marshy, boggy fields and pastures. Many horses with sweet itch can be controlled by turning them out onto hilltop pastures – away from these breeding grounds.  Hilltops pastures are also more exposed to wind, which will further repel midges from your animal.

The decision has to be yours. A great way to help you get clear on all of the advantages of living a drug-free life is to make a list of the benefits of sobriety. Here are some things that you may want to consider:   Meth use often impacts your quality of life. Your finances take a hit and relationships may be destroyed because of the erratic behavior that addiction creates. Also, you always run the risk of being arrested when you use illegal drugs. These are all things that could change when you stop using meth. Prolonged use of meth can cause negative health consequences such as extreme weight loss, severe dental problems including tooth loss, and skin sores that result from excessive scratching. Meth use can also increase the risk of contracting infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis.Being healthy for you and your family is often a pretty good reason to quit.; , Be intentional about removing the people who introduced you to the drugs from your life altogether.This includes old friends that you have gotten high with in the past as well as your drug supplier. You should remove any avenue that you could potentially use to contact them. This includes phone numbers that are stored in your cell phone, phone numbers that may be written down on pieces of paper in your wallet or in your home, and even social media contacts. This way you will no longer have access to people who have a negative influence on you.   If negative influences are still contacting you, then you may want to consider changing your phone number and deleting your social media accounts for a while. It is just as important to avoid going into old environments that may trigger your desire to use meth. Many people even take alternate routes to work to avoid driving past old acquaintances.  , Staying busy can also help you avoid negative influences. Try getting a job and even a second one if possible. Experiment with working longer hours or get started with a new hobby. Try to keep yourself busy so that you’re less likely to be distracted by negative people and places.  , It is really important to have a strong support system as you move through the process of quitting meth. There should be at least one person who you can call at any time to help you get through a tough moment.   Keep your sobriety partner’s phone number in your wallet, in your cell phone, or in any place where you will have easy access to it at all times. Identifying one person to be your sobriety partner is fantastic but having several people that you can call at a moment’s notice is ideal. Keep in mind that the larger your support network is, the more successful you’ll be with quitting.  , You may want to involve a family member or friend in this process so that you can make sure that you get all of the details that you need. Making an informed decision is important.   You may want to look at your plan’s brochure or schedule of benefits before actually contacting the insurance company. These written insurance materials should also have details about what is covered in your plan. If you don’t have insurance then treatment may be a little more difficult to obtain. However it is important to figure out how you are going to pay for your treatment. There are many social service programs that may be helpful. In addition, family and friends may be willing to assist financially so that you can get help.  , In general, the difference between the two treatment options is the level of intensity.Although both types can offer effective treatment programs, inpatient services tend to be more intense. Inpatient programs allow you to live at the facility with other people who are recovering from addictions and participate in daily meetings and support groups. Outpatient programs generally include counseling and monitoring but are not as intense as inpatient facilities.   Consider how severe your addiction is when deciding what type of treatment to undergo. If the addiction is severe and you are concerned that remaining at home while in treatment will result in you dropping out of the program, then an inpatient program is probably your best option. If the addiction is not extremely severe and you have other responsibilities like a job or children, you may want to consider an outpatient program. When making this decision you may want to asking for feedback from family members and other people who care about you. They may be able to see the situation a little more objectively. If you choose inpatient treatment, try to visit the facility in advance so that you are comfortable with where you will be living for the next few weeks or months.  , Be sure to tidy things up before you begin treatment. If you will be in inpatient treatment, talk to your supervisor about having time off from work so that your job can still be in place when you return. Even if you are in outpatient treatment, you may want to take a couple of days off, particularly at the beginning as you begin the process of sober living. This way, your work performance won’t be jeopardized. Also, if you are a mother (or father) of small children, you will need to arrange for childcare if you are unmarried and write lots of lists for your partner if you are married.   It may take up to 90 days to complete treatment.Sometimes it may even be longer, depending upon the severity of the addiction and your specific needs. However, you must be committed to the process and that includes preparing in advance for success. Remember, when you complete the program, you should have all of the tools that you need to stay substance free. You may not want to take too much time off from work if you are in outpatient treatment. Work is a way to stay busy and distracted.  , When you finally make the decision to pursue treatment, irrational fears and old thinking habits will try to creep back in. A great way to move past the fear is to use visualization.Try visualizing a huge multi-room mansion. You don’t know what’s in the rooms up ahead but you visualize that you’re taking the first step in faith. As you use this strategy, remind yourself that what’s ahead of you in the mansion is good for you and know that you’ll find the courage that you need to make it through the whole mansion. When the fear presents itself, gently remind yourself that you are doing the best thing possible for yourself by entering treatment.  , Overcoming a meth addiction use can be a very hard process, so it is very important to have a solid support system in place. Do not try to go through this process alone. Here are a couple of ways that you can get the support that you need:Rely on close family members and friends. If you’re reluctant to ask for support again because you’ve let them down in the past, consider going to family counseling. It’s very important that you have the support of those closest to you during this time. Make new friends. You can find healthy people engaged in constructive activities in places like church, civics groups, volunteer activities, school, classes, or events being held in your community. If you live alone or in a place where you readily have access to Meth or other drugs, consider moving into a drug-free living environment during outpatient treatment. This is also a good option to consider after you leave inpatient treatment. You’ll have more support in a healthier living environment.  , This may sound simpler than it is in reality, especially if you are in an outpatient program. When withdrawal symptoms emerge at the beginning, you may want to avoid the discomfort. Similarly, when you start to feel better toward the end of treatment, you may feel like you no longer need treatment. During these times, you may tempted to stop going to your sessions or discontinue inpatient treatment. However, that would not be a wise decision and will likely be detrimental to your success.   Inpatient treatment is very structured and at times it may even seem like it is beneath you to attend the sessions. In addition, the other people in treatment may be extremely vocal or have personalities that don’t match well with yours. When these frustrations arise, continue to remind yourself that this is only temporary and the end results are worth it. Rely on your support system during these times to keep you motivated. The moment that the thought “Don’t go today” creeps up into your mind, immediately call your accountability partner or other supportive person.  , It is imperative that you not only go to every meeting but that you also fully participate in the treatment that is offered. Get involved in the dialogue, do homework assignments, and make it a priority to get the most out of each session. There are various types of treatment options that may be provided:Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) helps you identify the factors that are contributing to your drug use and give you strategies to overcome them. Multidimensional Family Therapy (MFT) is often used with adolescents to help youth and their families address the abuse patterns and improve overall functioning within the family unit. Motivational incentives use behavioral reinforcement to encourage drug abstinence.  , Detoxification is the first step in treatment and the process will allow your body to rid itself of the drug.Be prepared to experience withdrawal symptoms during the first few days that you’re in treatment.These symptoms don’t feel good but they’re only temporary. Remind yourself that once you’ve made it through the first few days, that they will subside and you’ll feel better.   Long gone are the days when you have to go cold turkey and sit in treatment writhing in agony. Typically, medicine is used to help ease the withdrawal symptoms. So, although you will likely experience some of the physical symptoms of detoxing and withdrawal, they probably won’t be extreme. Medication such as methadone, buprenorphine and, and naltrexone are often used to relieve meth cravings so that you can disengage from drug seeking and focus on treatment. Some withdrawal symptoms that you may experience include difficulties breathing, diarrhea, shaking, paranoia, mood shifts, sweating, heart palpitations, vomiting, and nausea. Again, keep in mind that medications will help ease these symptoms. Meth is a amphetamine that results in the increase in dopamine production. Dopamine signals the brain to “feel good” and when a person stops taking meth the dopamine levels drop drastically. As a result, you may experience anhedonia or an inability to experience pleasure.This temporary condition usually lasts for a few weeks while the body readjusts its dopamine levels. Unfortunately, people often relapse during this time because they want to feel good again. Therefore, it’s important to recognize when this condition is occurring so that you don't drop out of treatment. In the beginning, the physical and emotional withdrawal symptoms may feel overwhelming and cause you to want to stop treatment. Discontinuing treatment is not a wise idea and could be detrimental to your success.  , Take time to really embrace your treatment. Remember to verbally congratulate yourself for having the courage to get better for yourself and your family.  , When leaving an inpatient program, you may want to first consider spending time in a recovery home. These homes are often referred to as sober-living homes or halfway houses. They can help bridge the gap between inpatient facilities and the outside world. You can learn more about relapse prevention in these homes before returning directly back to your old environment.These programs are often privately owned and can be expensive. Again, you may want to check to see if your insurance covers such programs. Other options are asking for financial assistance from social services, your church or local ministry, or arrange to pay out of pocket.  , This should be a priority and should be done as soon as your treatment is complete. In fact, it might be helpful to have one available before treatment even ends so that you can hop right in without delay. Joining a support group is extremely important in order to avoid relapse. Check to see if there is a local Crystal Meth Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous group that you can join. You can also get referrals from a physician, friend, or social service organization.   Spending time around other people who are in recovery in a supportive environment will help you when you reintegrate into your normal routine. Attending a support group even if you are in a recovery home is very important. This way you’ll already be used to it when you return home. Now that you feel better, other things will begin to compete for your attention again. During this transition, you may think that it’s okay to begin skipping meetings. Skipping support group meetings is not a wise idea and could be detrimental to your success.  , When you are in recovery, you still want to avoid friends and places that you used to spend time around when you were using meth. These people and environments will likely still be strong triggers for you. Therefore, avoiding them is especially important in the first few years of your recovery. Here are other ways to avoid triggers that could result in relapse:Avoid bars and clubs. Even if you don’t struggle with alcohol, alcohol can lower inhibitions and impair judgment. Also, you may be more likely to run into old buddies there or be in the presence of meth. The use of opiates and other prescription medication can trigger relapse but so can inadequate pain relief.Therefore it's important for you to be candid with doctors when seeking medical treatment. Do not be ashamed of your history and instead focus on avoiding relapse. If you need a medical or dental procedure, find a medical professional who will provide alternative medicines or prescribe the minimal amount of medication to provide you comfort but not trigger a relapse.  , Stress may trigger cravings for you yet it is impossible to avoid all stress. Therefore, it’s important to know how to manage the stress so that it does not become overwhelming and cause you to relapse. Here are some things that you can do to relieve stress:Exercise: Walking, running, biking, gardening, swimming, even cleaning your house helps. Write: Spend 10-15 minutes a day writing about stressful events that happened that day. It might help if after you write about the event that you rewrite the ending the way you would have liked for things to have gone. Write in the present tense, pretending as if it really happened that way. This way you end the writing exercise on a positive note. Talk it out: Whether you want to laugh, cry, or just vent a little, find a friend, Counselor or Clergyman who is available to be present and talk it out with you. Do something you enjoy: Find an activity that you really enjoy and spend some time doing that. It could be anything healthy that you enjoy, such as gardening, playing with your kids, going for a stroll, eating out, baking, or even just sitting outside in the fresh air for a while. If you enjoy it and it’s a healthy activity, then go for it. Meditate: Sit in a quiet place and breather in deeply through your nose and allow the air to go to your abdomen. Then breathe out through your mouth allowing the air to come up from your abdomen and out of your mouth. As you do this, focus on the breaths that you take. This is a great meditation process for stress relief. Yoga: Enroll into a yoga class or grab a few yoga DVDs to help with stress relief.  , Sometimes the cravings come hard and heavy, regardless of what you do. Therefore it is important to know exactly what to do when this occurs. Here are some great coping techniques that should be a part of your plan:Have productive thoughts while dealing with cravings. Tell yourself that it's a craving. Cravings are bound to happen, and dealing with the cravings will get easier all the time. Think, ""I need to ride out my cravings, one at a time so I can remain sober"". Keep a list of activities that you enjoy that can help distract you when the urge to use emerges. Some examples of distracting activities might include reading, writing in your journal, going to the movies, watching a movie at home, or going out to eat. Visualize that you’re a surfer who is determined to ride the wave until the craving passes. See yourself staying on top of the wave until it crests, peaks, and then returns to the less powerful, white and foamy surf. This technique is called “urge surfing.” List all of the benefits and consequences of using meth on an index card that you keep on you at all times. When a craving hits, pull out the card to remind yourself that you really won’t feel better if you use. Call your accountability partner or other supportive friend or family member so that you can talk through the urge.  , Goals are often a great drug prevention tool. When you are focused on achieving your goals, you are less likely to revert back to meth use. It doesn’t matter what the goals are – they can be focused on family, career, or even personal goals like completing a marathon or writing your first book. Just make sure that the goals that you choose are important to you.  , Call your sobriety partner, Therapist, Clergyman, go to a meeting, or schedule an appointment with your doctor as quickly as you can. The goal is to get back on track and out of danger as soon as possible.   Relapse is a common part of the recovery process. Don’t let it keep you down. Rather than look at it as failure, use it as a learning opportunity. When you are sober again, take a look at what triggered your relapse and figure out what you can do the next time a similar situation presents itself.  , After you have been in recovery for some time, you may decide that you want to educate the public or help others through their own recovery process. In fact, many people consider volunteering to be an essential part of their own recovery process.Becoming a role model or mentor is a great way to help others with their addictions. It can also help you maintain sobriety yourself as well as improve your own self-esteem. Volunteers also benefit from reduced rates of depression and an increased sense of life satisfaction and well being.   As you’re making your list, consider the types of people whom you would like to work with. Whatever your preferences are, make sure that you are clear about them in your mind before you agree to volunteer. Some things to consider when choosing the place where you will volunteer include age and gender of participants. Some people might prefer to educate youth while others may prefer to provide support for a specific gender.  , After you have developed a list of potential places to volunteer, now it is time to review the requirements for each organization. Some programs have stricter guidelines than others, particularly if you desire to mentor youth. If you meet the volunteer requirements then keep the organization on your list. If not, then cross it off and move on to the next.   Be sure that the volunteer opportunity is a good fit for you. For example, if you just want to volunteer once per month then make sure that the guidelines don’t expect weekly contact.  , Sometimes the organizations already have a formal volunteer program and you’ll probably just need to fill out an application and wait to be contacted. Other times, particularly if you’d like to talk to students in a school setting, you will probably need to call the organizational head to see if you could volunteer there.   You can usually find contact information on the website. You can call the contact person or send them a quick email.  , After you have arranged to provide services as a mentor you may start to experience some anxiety or fear. Anxiety is a normal reaction to any stressful event.Therefore its not unusual to be a little nervous before doing something new. However, try to stay motivated by reminding yourself that following through will help other people learn the tools that they need to have a better life. Here are a few other things that may help decrease your nervousness:   Get adequate rest the night before you volunteer. Sleep deprivation can increase your level of anxiety so be sure to go to bed at a reasonable hour. Try not to ruminate or think excessively about the upcoming volunteer assignment. Focus your thoughts on preparing for the event and then spend the rest of the time engaged in other healthy activities. Confront your fears. Try starting with activities that cause you lower levels of anxiety. Continue to engage in the activities until the anxiety no longer occurs. Try activities that are slightly uncomfortable but simple, like spooning soup into bowls at a soup kitchen. When you're comfortable with that then you can move up to other volunteer activities.

An ingrown nose hair may present itself as an inflamed area with or without pain, and there may be a tiny, pimple-like bump where you removed the hair and it is trying to grow back.You may see these symptoms either on the outside or inside of your nose.Make sure to not stick your fingers or any other objects deep inside your nasal cavity. Instruments can lodge themselves in your nose, causing severe harm to you. If you can’t locate the source of the pain or your ingrown hair, either leave it alone or see a doctor.; , Most ingrown hairs will heal on their own.Leaving the ingrown hair in your nose will keep it from getting further inflamed as well as eventually healing it.If an ingrown nose hair is especially painful or problematic, you can use other self-cures to treat it including hot compresses and anti-bacterial ointments.  , Using warm to hot compresses can kill bacteria in an ingrown hair and reduce the pain.Try this treatment before you opt for a more invasive option such as releasing the hair.   Heat two glasses of water to a comfortable, hot temperature that won’t burn your skin. Dip a soft cloth or cotton swab in the water and put it on the affected part of your nose. When the cloth or swab cools, repeat the process once more. Do this procedure two to three times per day.You may gently insert the warm cloth or swab inside your nose if the ingrown hair isn’t deep within your nasal cavity.Press the cloth or swab gently against the ingrown hair for a few minutes.Gentle, circular rubbing the inside or outside area of your nose affected by the ingrown hair may help release it. It’s not unusual to see a small amount of pus or blood if you do this., If you feel comfortable and the ingrown nose hair is really bothering you, use a sterile needle to release the tip of the hair. This will help you remove it and any debris such as dead skin that may be inside of it.If you can see the hair, then it’s safe to release it. After you’ve washed the area, insert a sterilized needles under the hair loop or loops and gently lift the ingrown hair tips either with your fingers or tweezers.Make sure that if you use a sterilized needle to release the hair that your skin is warm and moist. This will soften your skin and make it easier to remove the hair.  , Applying an antibiotic ointment or hydrogen peroxide on the area of ingrown hair will prevent infection. It also helps to reduce swelling and pain and enhance the healing.You can use anti-biotic ointments such as neomycin, polymyxin B, bacitracin to prevent infection.These are available at most drug and grocery stores and their online retail sites.  , While you’re still suffering from an ingrown nose hair, it’s important to not shave or tweeze other hair in the area until it heals. Continuing to do these activities can not only cause further inflammation and pain, but also cause infections.You can tweeze only if it’s to release the ingrown hair as described above. Otherwise, leave the area alone.  , If your ingrown nose hair doesn’t heal within a few days and it gets very painful, see a doctor. He can make sure you don’t have a serious infection, remove the hair, or discuss other treatment options with you.   Additional treatments include retinoids, corticosteroids, and antimicrobials.  , Bacteria can inflame and infect ingrown hairs, and the nose is a prime location for bacteria growth. Keeping your nose clean both inside and out will inhibit the growth of infection-causing bacteria and help prevent ingrown hairs.   When you are sick, blow your nose completely into a tissue. Don’t pick your nose. Your fingers can introduce bacteria into your nose that will infect an ingrown hair.  , Use either a trimmer designed specifically for the nose or a small pair of circular-ended scissors to groom your nose hair. These will keep you from cutting too closely to your skin, which encourages ingrown hairs.You can buy nose hair trimmers and small scissors at drug stores or department stores either online or in stores. The best way to get at pesky nose hairs is to gently make a pig’s nose by pressing backward on the tip of your nose. This will help so see inside of your nose and make you less likely to cut yourself.Make sure to cut only those hairs sticking out and not any inside your nose, which help act as a barrier between your respiratory system and the outside world., A depilatory cream, which is a chemical hair remover, is another method to remove nose hairs effectively while helping to prevent ingrown hairs. These can be harsh, so test it on your skin before you use it to make sure it won’t burn the skin around your nose.Do not use depilatory creams inside your nose, which can cause serious harm. Leave hair inside your nose alone as it helps keep out bacteria., If you find that you frequently have ingrown nose hairs, see your doctor to rule out conditions such as hormonal abnormalities. Your doctor can also help you find the best treatment and prevention for your chronic ingrown nose hairs.   If you’re a woman with excessive ingrown hairs, it may be a sign of hirsutism or polycystic ovary syndrome, both of which are treatable.","['ingrown nose hair', 'doctor', 'hair', 'affected area', 'nose', 'antibiotic ointment', 'sterile needle', 'trimmer', 'depilatory cream', 'scissors', 'nose hair', 'use hot compresses', 'skin heals', 'chronic ingrown hairs', 'ingrown hair']"
"['try hair-boosting vitamins', 'eat more protein', 'incorporate omega-3 acids into your diet', 'drink more water']",How to Grow Healthy Long Hair As Quickly as Possible3," Having a healthy dose of vitamins in your diet will improve your overall health. You can also purchase certain vitamins that lead directly to improving the health of your hair. Research products specifically for your hair type to find what will work best for you.Most of these vitamins can be incorporated into your eating routine naturally, if they aren't included in it already.   Biotin, otherwise known as Vitamin H, improves the health of your hair. It increases your hair's elasticity and moisturizes dryness. This will prevent breaking. You can find biotin in brown rice, lentils, oats, among other foods. Vitamin A helps produce healthy sebum, an oily substance released by your scalp. Sebum helps prevent dryness. Do not overload on Vitamin A, however, as an excess of it can actually lead to hair loss. Vitamin E promotes healthy skin while improving your body's blood circulation. This vitamin increases your body's ability to intake oxygen. Having a steady flow of oxygen into your body will aid your body in producing new hair cells.  , In addition to strengthening your hair, more protein in your diet will improve your inner health. When your body digests protein, it breaks it down into smaller amino acids.These will aid in the construction of new body tissues, antibodies, hormones, enzymes, and blood cells.   Meats like steak, chicken, and fish contain healthy protein and amino acids. If you're a vegetarian, you can get your protein from tofu, beans, nuts, and legumes. These foods also replenish other vitamins crucial to healthy hair growth. Protein is necessary for tissue repair. Your cells need amino acids to remain intact and healthy. Protein is the active substance in repairing broken cells, so having it in your diet will help replenish dead skin and hair cells.  , While they're tough to come by, Omega-3 fatty acids are vital to improving your inner health. Good fatty acids in your diet will lower triglyceride levels, reducing your risk for heart disease.Researchers have found that high levels of Omega-3 acids may also lead to lower levels of depression. Fish oil may even boost the effectiveness of certain anti-depression medication. While you can get Omega-3 acids from supplements, you should incorporate them into your diet. Many types of fish, including salmon, herring, and mackerel, contain high levels of healthy fatty acid. For vegetarians, get your Omega-3 acids from walnuts and flaxseed. Canola and soybean oils also contain these acids.  , Because so much of our body is made of water, the amount that you drink reflects in your healthy skin and hair.You want to make sure that you're properly purifying your water, so you aren't getting unwanted toxins.   If you're exercising regularly, you need to replenish the water that you lose through sweat. Pay attention to the color of your urine. A pale yellow or colorless stream will prove that you're drinking a healthy amount. Drinking water will flush out toxins in your body. Drink at least eight cups a day, or a cup for every twenty pounds of your body weight. A lack of water will dry up your hair. You will be left unwanted frizziness, and the healthy growth of your hair will be halted  ","['water', 'hair-boosting vitamins', 'diet', 'protein', 'omega-3 acids']"

It's important that you are clear, so that you can make it clear to your soon-to-be ex.   Is it because you argue all the time? Have you met someone new, whom you are interested in pursuing? Do you feel trapped without enough freedom? Are you being smothered? Are things just moving too fast? Are you tired of being pressured into having sex when you feel you just aren't ready yet? Have you grown tired of the relationship? Are you simply not looking forward to spending time with him/her any more?; , After you understand your negative feelings about the relationship, make up your mind to absolutely end the relationship, and move on to the next step.  , You will need to return all of his or her stuff - albums, earrings, jackets, books, watches, cameras, rings. Put it in a box and take it with you to your meeting. It's hard enough for him or her, probably - knowing that s/he must return and face you later to get those items will cause unnecessary pain, and will be uncomfortable for you, too. Taking it with you will help make this a clean break.  , Your former love should be given the dignity and respect that privacy affords. If your ex is prone to violent outbursts, you must choose a neutral location, such as a coffee shop or outdoor cafe. But if at all possible, try to keep things low key and between the two of you.  , State clearly that you've called him or her here to end the relationship. You may not need to recite a list of reasons - if you aren't asked to, don't. Stay as calm and be as nice about it as possible while understanding that, if this is a total shock to the other person, there will be some shock, disbelief, maybe anger, and certainly, pain. S/he may express anger or outrage at your decision, but stay calm and firm, and keep on point. Don't allow yourself to be pulled into an argument or shouting match about who was more at fault, or who is the worse person here.   Give reasons for the breakup only if you need to (s/he asks you why you are leaving) - s/he may already have suspected you weren't happy and that a breakup was coming, so s/he may not want to hear any more about it. When giving reasons for the breakup, don't launch into a laundry list. Choose the one or two most inarguable causes, and let that be enough. You want to help him or her to understand what went wrong, especially if some behavior on his or her part was the deal breaker. But you don't want to just beat him/her down into the ground with a long recitation of his/her faults. Try something like: ""It just comes down to basic incompatibility, Clark. I'm more open, and you're more secretive - it's almost like you're hiding something from me, and it drives me crazy. I want the chance to meet someone who is more transparent with me, and doesn't feel a need to keep secrets."" or , ""You are my first real relationship, Lana, and that's the problem. I want the chance to have other relationships. If we were really meant to be those rare first loves that last forever, I think I would feel more sure of that. But as much as I've cared for you, I feel I haven't experienced enough to make that lifelong commitment. I feel like there's something or someone out there waiting for me. I'll always care for you, and I'm sorry, I know this is hurting you, but I need to go.""   If things start getting out of hand tell him/her that you don't wish to argue or fight but that you have made up your mind and it is final. Give him/her the box of his or her things, then turn around and walk away before things escalate into an actual fight. If s/he is crying tell her/him that you are sorry to hurt him or her, but that this is your decision. Get up and leave. Let his/her friends do the comforting.  , If you have truly made up your mind to break up with him/her, it is best to stay away from him/her, refuse all calls from him/her, refuse to meet with him/her or talk with him/her. For some people, getting you to take calls, return texts, meet with him/her, etc. are a way of controlling you. Every moment they can get you to spend with them is a win for them, so don't do it. Let the break be clean and definite - and final.    Breaking up is like a band aid on your arm, you can pull it off slowly a little bit at a time and it will hurt for a long time, or you can pull it off quickly and all at once and it will all be over quickly and the hurt will be less painful and more merciful in the long run.  , Say nothing against your ex, and don't allow your friends to trash talk him/her, either. Instead, take the high road, and hope that's what gets back to your ex - and not a lot of mean backbiting. If s/he starts trash talking you, and you hear about it, just respond with something like, ""S/he must still really be hurting. That makes me feel bad for him/her.""   It is your and his/her private business and no one else's - don't broadcast it. It's bad form. If he/she threatens you with violence or begins stalking you, immediately notify the police or, if you are a minor, tell your parents or guardians. Breaking up is sad, but it is better to end a relationship than to live in a dating relationship that is no longer satisfying. (However if you are married, or if there are children involved, it is better to try your best to work things out and if necessary get professional help in doing so. A failed marriage is much worse than a failed ""first relationship"").  ","['firm', 'terms', 'his/her things', 'trash talk', 'decision', 'end contact', 'kind', 'him/her']"

Schools are usually run by independent boards elected by the families of that school, and it's often required that board members have students of their own in the school. In exchange for its independence, a charter school is subject to performance reviews and may close for failing to meet agreed-upon outcomes. Charter schools can be small, independent operations or can be part of a larger education company.   These schools operate under the Charter Innovations, which include allocation of resources, new approaches to administration and governance, extended learning time, and educator evaluation. Students attend charter schools as a choice made by parents or guardians, rather than a school district. Because of the opt-in nature of these schools, there is often greater parental involvement.; , 6,723 charter schools currently exist in the United States, and these schools make up 6% of total public enrollment. An estimated 2.9 million children attend approximately 6,700 charter schools across the country in a variety of many settings --- rural, urban, and suburban. As of the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year, charter school students made up 6% of U.S. K-12 students in 42 states.  , Charter schools are the fastest-growing school option in the United States public education system. Over recent years, the number of charter schools has grown by six percent, nearing 7,000 as of the end of 2014. It is estimated that charter schools will begin to educate 20-40% of all public school students by 2035., Charter schools accept all students, regardless of where they live or of their ethnicity. In fact, they must be non-discriminatory in admissions and serve all students, including those with disabilities, and their students tend to be as equally diverse as public school students in terms of both race and economic status.If applications to attend a charter school exceed spaces available, the enrollment is deemed by a lottery system, and students who do not get the opportunity to attend can be put on a wait list.  , Since they are public schools, charter schools are unable to charge tuition. Therefore, they are based on a slightly different system than both private schools and district public schools. Like public schools, charter schools are funded according to enrollment and receive funding from the district and state. However, unlike public schools, charter schools often don’t have access to capital or facilities funding, or they may receive less than districts do from these funding sources.In fact, charters receive on average 28% less funding, or 3,509 dollars per pupil, than their public school district peers, which could determine program cuts. , Whereas public school teachers need teaching certifications, charter schools may hire educators that often have professional experience in their subject, but may not be traditionally credentialed. Charter school employees also tend to be more diverse than district schools. For example, Caucasian teachers make up 82% of district school teachers and only 70% of charter school teachers, and African American teachers represent 12% of charter school educators and only 7% of district school teachers. , Like any type of school, a charter school comes with its pros and cons. While it may get less funding, it can also offer an alternative learning environment that may work for your child. Charter schools are no longer just alternatives in low-income urban areas but are beneficial alternatives in rural and suburban areas as well, and successful charter schools can increase access to a high-quality education and help close the achievement gap. If you don't think that the district public schools in your area are the best option for your child, you might want to compare the pros and cons to consider whether a charter school would be a preferable alternative.

Get a pair of sharp scissors to obtain the smoothest cuts in your fabric. A quality fabric glue can also help save you some time sewing. Gather these tools and have them ready when you begin making your costume:   Scissors Sewing machine Fabric glue Tape measure  , Use a clean table to lay out your pieces of fabric flat for cutting. Make sure you are in a place with plenty of light. Move a lamp next to your table if possible.  , Buy a sweatshirt and sweatpants that are golden colored for the lion’s body.   A golden colored onesie makes a great lion’s body for a toddler.  , Measure the distance from the middle of the chest to the belly button. Cut a felt oval to cover the belly of the person wearing the costume.  , Use fabric glue or sew a brown felt oval to the stomach of the costume.If you are using a onesie, place the felt on the front of the onesie. Cut the oval in half where the zipper of the onesie goes up.  , Measure the ovals to be 6 inches tall by 4 inches wide. Depending on the age and size of the person wearing the costume, you may want to make the ears larger or smaller., Leave one of the short ends of the ovals unsewn. Use a sewing machine or hand stitch the fabric together around the edges.  , Push the fabric through the unsewn end to turn the stitching on the inside of the ear.  , Use pillow filling to fill the ears. Place enough filling to give the ears some volume. You do not need to stuff the ear completely full; a small wad in each ear is enough.  , Push the filling to the outside to create a full look around the exterior of the ear. Add more stuffing if you need to create a thicker ear. Place a few stitches in the center of the ear to keep the middle pinched together. , Wrap the open ends of the ears around a plastic headband.

"['keep trying new things', 'exercise', 'journal', 'read fiction', 'play games that require reasoning skills', 'create', 'pay attention to the purpose behind your actions', 'identify your biases', 'consider the implications of your options', 'watch for over-generalizations', 'do not make assumptions', 'avoid catastrophic thinking', 'pay attention to how your read situations']",How to Improve Reasoning Skills," A great way to improve reasoning skills is to keep trying new things. The mind is like any other muscle. It requires exercise and stimulation. Make a point of trying out new hobbies and activities on a regular basis.   Pick activities that are vastly different from one another. If you're already an outdoor enthusiast, instead of taking up hiking consider learning to crochet. If you're big into crafts and working with your hands, consider trying to do crossword puzzles or Sudoku in your spare time.Take classes if possible. Taking a pottery class or poetry class at a local community center can be a fun way to challenge your brain and encourage you to try new things.; , Physical exercise actually has an effect on memory and thinking. Many studies indicate the parts of the brain responsible for thinking and reasoning are bigger in those who exercise regularly. Also, exercise reduces stress and anxiety and boosts mood, which can make it easier to concentrate and learn. Strive to incorporate regular physical activity into your day-to-day routine. This can lead to an improvement in critical thinking skills. While researchers are still unsure if one form of exercise is better than another, some research indicates aerobic exercise is most helpful to mental stimulation., Daily journaling can actually help improve critical thinking skills. In addition to helping you revisit your day, journaling encourages reflection and thought.   Writing is an active endeavor. It forces you to expand and explore your thoughts. Keeping a journal that details your day, your feelings, and anything you thought about throughout the day can make you a more introspective, aware person. This can lead to higher reasoning skills.Make time to journal every day. Schedule regular journaling time into your day-to-day life as you would brushing your teeth, showering, and eating dinner. It may be helpful to schedule journal time after an activity you're accustom to doing every day, as this will make it easier to remember to keep up with your journal.  , Reading in general is great for improving critical thinking. However, fiction specifically can allow you to be more comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. This can lead to more sophisticated thinking as well as more creativity.Fiction can force you to become more insightful about other perspectives due to the focus on character.This can make you more in tune to the cultures, belief systems, and skill sets of those around you. You may be better at, say, reasoning with those around you as you'll have a greater capacity for empathy. Black and white thinking is also lessened through reading fiction. People who read fiction over time may have more sophisticated thought patterns as they're able to navigate and accept the ambiguity in a variety of situations., There are a variety of games that require you to reason. Strategic board games, games like chess, and word games all help reasoning skills.   Look for board games that rely on more than just look. Explore in depth strategy games where decision making is a key part of the process. Schedule a regular game night with friends and aim to play games that require thought and attention. Clue and Risk require critical thought. Games like Scrabble and Boggle teach you to analyze information quickly.Chess and checkers all require reasoning skills. Consider joining or starting a chess club.Consider games you can play on your own. You can play certain card games alone online. Purchase a Rubik's Cube and spend time trying to solve it., Forcing yourself to create on a regular basis can improve reasoning skills. You don't necessarily have to be highly adept at a creative activity but forcing the mind to try new things can increase reasoning skills. Try to play a musical instrument. Take up drawing. Write a poem. Compose a short song., Each time you make a decision throughout the day, there is some purpose behind it. Given the hectic demands of day-to-day life, people sometimes lose track of the purpose and goals behind their actions. Try to be aware of the inherent purposes driving you throughout the day.   Focus on larger goals at work or school. Where do you want to be in five years? Two years? One year? How are you current actions serving this goal? Do your actions make sense reasonably given your larger purpose? Answering these questions can help you improve your reasoning skills.Try to make sure your actions are actually serving some purpose. Oftentimes, people get caught up in the idea something has to be done in a particular way or they have to follow a particular path. Actions then become unreasonable. Try to keep the end in mind when you take a certain action., Everyone has biases, whether they are aware of them or not. If you want to improve reasoning skills, try to identify your biases.   A major bias is that people often only consider a situation or a problem from one point of view. When dealing with an issue at work, school, or home pause and ask yourself a few questions before taking action. Ask, ""What do I believe about the situation? Why do I believe this? What assumptions might I be making about the thoughts and ideas of others?""It's important to take steps to be self aware of your own biases. This can help you avoid having those biases obstruct your judgment.It may even be helpful to ask a close friend about your gaps in thinking. Approach a friend with a question like, ""What are some ways I sometimes behave irrationally?"" Ask for honesty and openness.  , Each time you make a choice, there are consequences. A good way to improve reasoning skills is to make a point of stopping to consider those consequences on a conscious level.   Use your imagination. Before making a choice in a given situation, pause to imagine a variety of possible outcomes. How do you feel about these outcomes? What's the worst care scenario? Best case scenario? What is reasonably most likely to happen? Why?Also, do not neglect to consider the viewpoints of others affected by your decision. This can help you explore your decision through a variety of angles., Many people over generalize without realizing it. This is toxic to rational thinking. Try to be aware of any over-generalizations you may make in day-to-day life.   Over-generalizations are taking one particular event and seeing it as evidence of how things have always been or always will be. For example, if you do bad on one test you may think, ""I'm stupid and always fail at school."" In making this statement, you're glossing other academic success you have had in the past in the light of one event.All-or-nothing thinking is a form of generalizing where you see things in black and white terms. All-or-nothing thinking places things in only one or two categories: good or bad, success or failure, etc. This results in missing the shades of gray in a situation. For example, if you get a mixed review of your performance at work you may see yourself as a failure. In reality, you're likely a competent worker with some areas that need improvement.Filtering out positive is a thought pattern in which too much focus is placed on the bad aspects of a situation. If 20 good things happen in a day followed by 1 bad thing, you may focus entirely on the negative. For example, say you make a single mistake during a musical performance but otherwise play perfectly. You might be tempted to declare the performance a disaster. In reality, you are probably the only person who noticed a single wrong note., People make assumptions about all kinds of situations. This can lead to unreasonable thinking. Strive to be aware of any assumptions you make.   Sometimes, people engage in mind-reading. That is, you make assumptions about what others think of your or a situation. In reality, it's impossible to know what another person is thinking without asking. For example, you may find yourself thinking ""I bet everyone thought I was an idiot in that meeting"" or ""I bet that co-worker thinks I talk too much."" If you notice yourself engaging in such thoughts, try to remind yourself that you are probably not as good as reading people's opinions as you think you are.Fortune telling is a form of thinking where you think you know what will happen in the future. This can be in the form of a defeatist attitude. For example, ""I'll never be able to stick to a diet and lose weight"" or ""I know I'm going to sound like an idiot during my presentation tomorrow."" Keep in mind that, in reality, you cannot know what will happen tomorrow or in the coming weeks., Many people catastrophize situations when they're upset or stressed. For example, you might think you'll be financially bankrupt forever if you need to pay for car repairs one month. If you get rejected romantically, you might decide you're not destined for love. Try to keep in mind that one setback or misfortune is not necessarily indicative of things to come., Oftentimes, people unconsciously read situations in an irrational way. Watch how you think and perceive situations in day-to-day life.   Labeling is the tendency to put a name on a situation. For example, ""This person made a mistake"" or ""I made a bad choice."" This leads you to put people and situations into categories based on solitary instances. Try your best not to categorize and avoid the temptation to judge.Personalization is the tendency to take situations and other people's reactions personally. For example, you may assume a co-worker is mad at you if she doesn't stop to chat in the break room. In reality, she may just be busy. Try not to take situations personally.Oftentimes, you hold yourself to an unreal ideal. You might see someone else's success as evidence of your shortcoming. Try to keep in mind everyone is different and moves at a different pace.","['reasoning skills', 'implications', 'over-generalizations', 'pay attention', 'assumptions', 'biases', 'options', 'read situations', 'purpose', 'new things', 'catastrophic thinking', 'fiction', 'games', 'actions']"
"['wear a comfortable', 'breathable top', 'err on the side of longer shorts', 'don’t take off your shirt', 'don’t grunt or scream', 'don’t show off unneeded gear or accessories']",How to Look Good At the Gym3," Compared to women, men have almost all of the same options for gym tops available (with the obvious exceptions of halter tops, etc.) Men at the gym look best in tops that are functional, comfortable, and breathable. Many men choose to wear ordinary cotton tee shirts, though, as always, modern moisture-wicking fabrics are an even more comfortable choice and usually look great as well.   If you want to show off your arms, you also have the option of wearing an A-frame tee (tank top) or a sleeveless tee. These types of shirts sometimes even come with long slits along the sides to give a view of your abs and lats — though this style is sometimes considered ""bro-y"", it provides great ventilation and is not usually prohibited in gym dress codes.  , Generally, it's a little less acceptable for men to wear very short shorts to the gym than it is for women. Showing upper thigh can be considered a fashion faux pas unless a man is on a cross country team, so, if you typically wear shorts, it's usually best to opt for longer styles. Even shorts that hang past most men's knees aren't usually considered too baggy, so don't feel any need to shy away from longer styles.  , While some men like to take off their shirts to cool down during a long jog or while playing sports, it's sometimes considered rude to do so at the gym. At gyms where this isn't common, taking off your shirt can make you look like a vain ""meathead"" in comparison to the other people exercising. In addition, if you get very sweaty when you exercise, removing your shirt can cause you to leave behind more sweat where you work out, which can gross out others.   However, it's definitely worth noting that some men swear by the act of exercising shirtless, claiming it as a powerful motivating factor.If you're unsure whether it's considered rude to exercise shirtless at your gym, talk to the staff or simply observe the other members for a few days.  , Like taking off your shirt, letting out excessive noise while you exercise (especially while you lift weights) can make you appear vain or attention-seeking. It's also somewhat disrespectful of the people around you, for whom the extra noise may be somewhat awkward or intimidating. While some grunting may be unavoidable during heavy exercise, try to avoid loud grunts or screams to avoid giving the wrong impression of yourself.  , The gym is for playing sports and exercising — not playing games of equipment one-upsmanship with other gym members. While it's perfectly acceptable to bring gloves, headbands, accessories, reading material, music playing devices, and anything else that makes your workout more comfortable or productive, these accessories shouldn't be a point of pride in and of themselves. Having a great workout is the focus of your visit to the gym — everything else should just be a tool to help you achieve this.   One recent gym trend is the use of elevation training masks during exercise. These masks partially restrict the flow of oxygen into the lungs as the wearer trains, supposedly simulating the effects of training at a high altitude where oxygen in the air is limited. Though some claim great results, there is little (if any) evidence to support the claim that these devices make your lungs use oxygen more efficiently, making them not only a bizarre fashion choice, but also a likely waste of money.

That being said, there’s no shame in seeing that “Game Over” message across your screen repeatedly. Dark Souls 2 requires patience and learning to beat it.   Make sure you find each of the area’s bonfires. Bonfires are Dark Souls’ save points. Use your acquired souls a soon as possible since dying twice without retrieving your souls makes your souls gone forever.; , Facing the bosses of Dark Souls 2 means going head to head against some of gaming’s toughest bosses. You’re well-advised to study each boss’ movements and patterns. You should also equip weapons and spells appropriate to the boss you’re facing.   Upgrade your armor and weapon if you have souls to spare. Level up and improve your stats so you can increase your chance of beating the bosses.  , If you have friends online, you can ask for their assistance. Meaning, you can summon them up in your game, and actually join you in your adventure.   You can invite assistance from friends or other players by using an item called the summon sign. Simply use it on the floor, and players can join you from this point. Without actual friends online, make sure to summon AI players to beat bosses. Summoning AI players requires summoning signs and you should be in human form.  , This is the first boss that you will encounter in Dark Souls 2. Well, at least the one you are supposed to beat first. He’s a huge tree-like creature with a powerful swing. He will also attempt to stomp on you, but you should be able to dodge that easily.   The primary technique to beat the giant is to stay close to him. His stomps may intimidate you, but just roll away from them. Strike his feet with your weapon and just watch out for the stomps. He will occasionally reposition himself, but no worries, just get close to him again. Be aware of the battle area. Make sure you don’t to get cornered by this giant. Once you manage to lessen the giant’s health to 50%, it will remove its arm and use it to hit you. Just the same, keep close to his feet, and you should be fine. There are times when the giant falls down. Take this opportunity to hit him while he is caught off-guard.  , You will have the chance to battle this boss early in the game on the plaza of the Forest of Fallen Giants. However, that is just an optional battle—you will battle him for real at the top of a nearby tower.   This boss employs speedy attacks, and can really deal serious damage, so watch out. You can use striking attacks plus lightning for this boss is weak against those. In order to deal a large amount of damage to the Pursuer, align him with the ballista and fire away. Keep in mind though that he can destroy those ballistas so use them early. His thrust attacks are unblockable, so don’t bother using your shield against it. A safe tactic is to just keep your distance, allow him to attack and after he sways his weapon, dodge and counter-attack. It might take a while, but this technique can kill him eventually.  , The Dragonrider is found at Heide’s Tower of Flame, at the base of the tower. Get ready for a close-combat surprise.   You will be fighting the Dragonrider in a small enclosed area, so keep on moving to avoid his attacks. Watch out for the pit surrounding the combat area. One slip, and you’re dead. The Dragonrider’s weapon is its Halberd. He will continuously lunge at you with it, so do a sidestep all the time. When you’re almost facing his back, that’s the time to attack. You can summon the AI player Masterless Glencour to assist you just outside the tower’s entrance. Just keep on circling around this boss, and you will soon beat him.  , Still from Heide’s Tower of Flame comes another boss, the Old Dragonslayer. This boss is just like an upgraded Dragonrider with one difference. This boss can use a few dark magic spells.   You can still use the assistance of Masterless Glencour to beat this boss. The Old Dragonslayer is susceptible to poison, so use those poison bombs away! The Old Dragonslayer’s weaknesses are lightning and magic, so when at a distance, you can actually try using magic projectiles towards him, but that’s if your chosen class has access to magic. This boss is really aggressive, so move a lot. You can also sidestep him, and try to hit his back. Use your shield to block his sweep attacks. If playing on Scholar of the First Sin version, watch out for the dragon at the entrance to the arena. Tackle this boss after Mytha so you have a higher healthpool.  , This boss can be easily beaten if you have already mastered how to handle melee-based bosses like the Old Dragonslayer and the Dragonrider. The Flexile Sentry is another melee-oriented boss with two sides; he can employ close- to medium-range attacks.   Use magic on your weapon because it will slightly increase damage dealt to the boss. You can summon the AI player Lucatiel of Mirrah to assist you in beating this boss. She can be summoned inside the building just facing the stairwell that leads to the left portion of the docks. Flexile Sentry has two sides: one is a double-sword wielder, and the other one uses clubs to attack you. The club side is way slower than the sword wielder, so use this time to deal damage to him especially after he lands his giant slam at the end of his combo. While he is recovering from the slam attack, get close to him, and attack with all your stamina. Once he regains his fighting stance, just roll away from him, and recover your stamina. Heal if needed using your Estus Flask. Watch out for his switching since the sword side of this enemy is more challenging. Good thing your AI companion can keep him busy while you attack the boss’ blind side.  , Don’t be fooled by the Ruin Sentinel, it should actually be “Ruin Sentinels.” You will face not just one but three Ruin Sentinels in the Lost Bastille. These sentinels have pole arms as weapons.   Initially, you will just fight one sentinel, but right after defeating this sentinel, two more sentinels will awaken and fight you simultaneously. Fight the first sentinel on top of the platform, and just move around until it makes an attack. After attacking, that’s your cue to attack back. Keep your shield up when blocking. The sentinels are weak against lightning and can be vulnerable to magic, too. It is almost a requirement for you to summon an AI player to aid you with this difficult boss fight. You can summon this phantom inside a cell just along the corridor towards the boss battle area. The phantom is a magic-type character, so it will help you a lot in defeating the sentinels. Unlike the previous bosses, getting close to the sentinels all the time is not always a good idea. Since there will be two sentinels going after you, you need to keep your distance where you can see both bosses. Ranged weapons can be handy in defeating the sentinels. You should just focus your attack on one sentinel and then the next one. Never attempt to finish both sentinels at the same time. Once you finish off the second sentinel, the third one will be an easy one. If you still have the phantom around, this should be a walk in the park.  , The Lost Sinner is another melee-based boss found at the bottom of Sinner’s Rise area. It wields a great sword and will aggressively attack you when able.   This boss has no elemental weakness, so you need to defeat it with melee-based attacks, too. The Lost Sinner might be aggressive in her attacks, but equipping a large shield should protect you from her attempts. Just like how you dealt with the other melee-based bosses, just circle around this boss, and you should be alright. Remember to heal up if she, for some reason, damages you. This boss is very agile. In times that you are having a hard time landing attacks, you can switch to your projectiles or ranged weapons.  , This boss battle is a riot. You will be faced with multiple gargoyles in a not-so-spacious rooftop. Not only do you have to deal with the gargoyles’ melee attacks, they are all fire-breathing as well. They can also float, so this makes things even more difficult.   These gargoyles are weak against lightning and magic. Whether you are a melee- or a ranged-attack-oriented player, this boss battle is going to be tough. Enter the battle with lots of estus flasks. Initially, you will be facing just one gargoyle. Take advantage of this moment because after a few seconds, the other gargoyles will start to awaken. Expect a lot of running on your part. The idea is to isolate one gargoyle so you could damage it without any distractions from the other gargoyles. Ironically, when there are lots of bosses in your face, there’s no available AI assistance for this one. Sorry. If you are a caster type, it will somehow make this boss fight a little easier, but don’t expect it to be easy. Patience and proper movement will win you this boss fight—with a little luck, of course.  , This boss fight is kind of unique. The battle will take place inside the Undead Purgatory in a circular arena. It will mostly be a dodging game, while the other half of the battle is an actual battle with the chariot’s two-headed horse.   The enemy skeletons in this area are weak against fire and slightly against magic. Same goes to the boss himself. The first part of this boss battle is a matter of dodging the boss’ chariot, and at the same time kill the skeletons that are in the arena. Target the necromancers since they are the ones summoning these undead creatures. There’s an option for you to roll under the chariot if you are light enough. The timing is a bit tricky though, so you might just want to stick to the conventional way of dodging. Defeating the horse is somewhat easier compared to the earlier bosses that you have faced. It has a limited number of attacks, so you will get to predict its attacks in no time. If you have a fire resin, attacking the horse with a fire sword will make the boss fight even easier. Keep this up, and you will end up victorious.  , Technically, you will face three bosses in the Huntsman’s Copse. One lord will be using pyromancy, and the other two are melee attackers.   This battle seems easy at first because of the spacious battleground, but since the Skeleton Lords summon skeleton minions, it makes things a bit complicated. The skeleton minions seem to be just a nuisance to the boss battle since they are very fragile and easy to beat. They’re just too many! You can use an item called Alluring Skulls so these pesky skeletons will stop bothering you from finishing the Skeleton Lords. You can also use this moment to heal up if you are badly damaged.  , You can find this boss inside the Doors of Pharros. Like the Skeleton Lords, this boss also has minions to aid it against you, but rats this time.   The boss and the rat minions are all weak against fire. On the other hand, avoid any poison-based attacks since that’s the rats’ main ability. Needless to say, they are immune to it. You should clear the area first of rats, so that when the boss jumps down it will be just between you and the Giant Rat. The Giant Rat only has two distinct attack patterns: the swipe attack, and the jump attack. Both can easily be dodged in a one-on-one. The best way to inflict damage to the Giant Rat is to its belly, so lock onto the belly as your target. You can roll over under him so you can get more access to its weak point. Watch out for your stamina. If you’re caught under him with zero stamina, you will take a large amount of damage from it.  , The Covetous Demon is a giant slug that is weak against fire. Magic seems to have an increased damage effect to this boss as well.   The Covetous Demon is mainly a melee-type boss so your strategy is to run around him while attacking whenever possible. Counter-attacking can also be effective. You can use the pots around the fighting arena that you can smash freeing some undead. This will lure the Covetous Demon to the undead leaving himself open for attacks. Dealing damage to the Covetous Demon from afar with ranged weapons or projectiles will make this boss battle easier.  , Another boss found in Harvest Valley, she surrounds herself with poison making it almost impossible for you to defeat her as is.   This boss’ ultimate weakness is fire, so better use fire-based weapons or spells to quickly finish the battle. There is something you must do first to defeat this boss with ease. First, go to the Central Earthen Peak bonfire, and turn around. Just straight ahead is a ledge. Walk right on this ledge and burn the windmill by using your torch. This will eliminate the poison mist in the Baneful Queen Mytha’s lair. You can summon the AI player Doors of Pharros near the queen’s lair entrance. Without the poison mist and with AI assistance, this boss battle won’t be that hard to finish off. She will occasionally cast magic, but all of her attacks can be blocked.  , This is one boss who’s a real tough guy. His built is enough to intimidate you, and what more with his flaming personality. This boss can be found at the end of the Iron Keep area. He has close melee attacks and some ranged ones, too.   Because of his built, this boss pauses after every major attack. Use these precious seconds to land attacks, and then back away. Watch out for his slam attack which also spreads fiery projectiles. Make sure that you are away from him when he employs this attack. Good thing is that he is vulnerable to attacks after this slam stance. Approach him, and give him a good amount of damage before he goes back to his feet. You can trigger this slam attack if you get close to him, so just repeat the process until you defeat the boss.  , This marks the last of the early bosses in Dark Souls 2. Another boss in the Iron Keep, but he is an optional one. Meaning, you can move forward in the game without beating this boss. Well, that’s if you don’t want delicious rewards that you can acquire after beating this boss.   This boss is resistant to fire, but can be a bit weak to magic and lightning. The Smelter Demon will damage you a lot, but since his attacks are mostly fire-based, it is advisable that you wear an armor that is strong against fire. You cannot be consistently near this boss either since by just being near him you actually lose life. It is called proximity damage. This boss often cool downs after every huge attack. Use this downtime to your advantage. Keep your shield up when he does his deadly sword swing. The best shield that you can use in this battle is the Gyrm Greatshield. It blocks physical and fire damage up to 100%. With all the boss’ attacks seem powerless, the only thing you should do now is to deal damage to him and beat him.  , After defeating the optional boss, at this point your character is now a fully grown character with strong stats and ready for the next level. Go forth to the Shaded Woods to start on the second set of bosses that are on a higher bracket of evil.","['battle', 'skeleton lords', 'friends', 'last giant', 'baneful queen mytha', 'royal rat authority', 'executioner', 'old dragonslayer', 'dragonrider', 'covetous demon', 'sinner', 'shaded woods', 'flexile sentry', 'smelter demon', 'old iron king', 'sentinel', 'pursuer', 'chariot', 'belfry gargoyles']"

Look under the tag on the strand of lights to find voltage information.  , Some light strands blink because they have special bulbs that twinkle. If that’s the case with your lights, you can get rid of the twinkle feature by switching out the bulbs.   Oftentimes, the bulbs that blink on these strands will be marked with red or silver tips.However, if they aren’t marked, plug in the strand, let it warm up, and use a small piece of masking tape to mark each blinking bulb., First, unplug the lights. Then, for each blinking bulb, hold the bulb by the base (where the light attaches to the strand) and pull out the bulb and the bottom casing. Remove the bulbs from the casing.If you have trouble removing the bulb and casing, use a screwdriver to pry the light out.  , For every blinking bulb that you removed, you want to replace it with a non-blinking bulb. Insert the new bulb into the case, making sure the two wires on the end go through the holes in the bottom of the case.   Fold the wires back so they rest against the side of the casing. When you have finished, reinsert the new bulb and casing back into the base.  , When you have replaced all the blinking bulbs and returned them all to their bases on the light strand, plug in the lights and test them. Give them a few minutes to warm up.  , Some lights have the twinkle function run by a control box that contains wires and a simple electrical board. Because this method involves cutting and splicing wires, it requires much more care and attention. Before you start, it’s very important to ensure the lights are unplugged and not wrapped around the tree.  , It will be a small rectangular box, and it’s usually located near the plug. You’ll know it’s the control box because the lights from the wires and the electrical plug will all run through it.  , Some are glued, some are screwed, and some are clipped together. You may need a screwdriver to remove the screws, or you may need one to pry apart the control box.   Once open, remove the contents of the box, including the electrical board and the wires.  , Use wire cutters or sharp scissors to cut the power cord where it’s connected to the electrical board. Then, cut the hot wires and the neutral wire., For the hot and neutral wire, strip about an inch of the wire coating off each of the wires. An inch from the top, use the scissors to cut through just the top layer of coating. Use your fingers, the scissors, or pliers to grip the coating and pull it off.   For the power cable, peel apart the two sides and separate the first two to three inches of cable. Then strip an inch of wire coating off each side to expose the wires beneath.  , Use a multimeter to determine the neutral wire and the hot wires. When you’ve located the hot wires, line them up side by side and then gently twist them all together. Leave the neutral wire aside for now.  , Take one of the two sides of the power cord and twist that together with the hot wires. Then, twist together the other side of the power cord and the neutral wire., Before testing your lights, wrap the exposed wires with electrical tape. First tape the hot wires where they meet the power, then separately tape the neutral wires where the meet they power cord, then tape it all together.   If the two sides of the power cable are wrapped around each other, untangle them. Test your lights. Be sure to watch for smoke and sparks, especially where you spliced the wires.  , This method will stop LED lights from blinking, especially if they weren’t meant to twinkle in the first place. LED lights will sometimes flicker because electricity only flows through them one way, so when they are plugged into an alternating current power source, they flicker off when they don’t get any power.A bridge rectifier will convert the power going to the lights to direct current, meaning they won’t flicker on and off.You can purchase one at an electronics store or online. Make sure you buy one that matches the voltage of your lights.  , Again, this method requires extreme caution and is best only pursued if you have some background knowledge about electronics and wiring. You could electrocute yourself or cause a fire if you attempt these steps otherwise.  , Halfway between the last light on the strand and the power plug, use wire cutters or sharp scissors to cut through the two wires. Take the wires attached to the plug and untangle them. Next, strip off an inch of wire coating to expose the wires.   When you have finished, slide an inch-long piece of heat shrink over each wire., Make sure you attach each wire to one of the AC pins on the bridge rectifier. It doesn’t matter which wire goes to which pin, since it’s an alternating current., First, untangle the wires (if they’re wound around each other) and strip off an inch of wire coating from the two wires attached to the light strand. Next, use a multimeter to determine which wire is positive and which is negative.   Make a note of which wire is which, and then slide a one-inch long piece of heat shrink over each wire.  , Solder the positive wire to the positive pin on the rectifier, and the negative wire to the negative pin on the rectifier.  , When you have soldered all the wires to attach the plug and the lights to the bridge rectifier, position the heat shrink over the exposed wires. One at a time, activate the heat shrink by applying the heat from a heat gun or blow dryer to the area.   When you’ve finished, plug in the lights and test them out.

Keep everything you want to keep, trash junk, recycle papers, give stuff away to family/friends, and donate the other stuff to Goodwill or the Salvation Army. This is a pretty essential step, because it will help declutter your room as well as get rid of clothes that you don't want. Empty your room of any unwanted toys, games etc. so you don't have to re-clean your room after.  , This could include your bed, dresser, desk, drawers...  , The best quality paints can typically be found at home improvement stores such as Lowe's or Home Depot. Color really helps change a room. If you don't want to repaint your room, your parents won't allow you to paint your walls, or if you can't afford paint, that's okay. Move on to the next step. If they will, then get stuck in!   Pick a color that you like and that goes well with a lot of other things that are in your room. If you want, you can paint all of your walls the same color, but it can be even more interesting to paint a few different colors; this will provide variety. Or, go nuts and paint each wall a different color, and have no theme whatsoever. Do whatever you like! Whatever you do, let your personality shine. If you and your parents are struggling to decide what color to paint your room, compromise. Do your parents want you to paint your room light pink, but you want to paint it black (or vice versa)? Compromise by painting your room light pink and use black as an accent. Tape the paint samples to the wall when you get them, so you can get an idea of how they would look in your room. Look at the wall that your 'future bed' will be and make it a darker shade, if you want to give your room some definition.  , Do you really want that ABC dresser in your room? No way! Go out and get some new furniture. You'll need a bed (of course), a dresser, a bookcase, a bedside table, and a desk. Try buying all of your furniture in the same color so that your room doesn't look too crazy (unless that's your intention).   Look in thrift stores for bargain furniture finds. Just check there is no insect infestation before dragging it home though; if you're not sure, take a flashlight along and do a close inspection. This is more of an issue in some places than others, so ask your parents for advice. Consider repainting old furniture for a completely new look that matches your color scheme. To brighten and modernize your room a little, don't just buy a bed, dresser, desk etc., but a small couch and bedside table too. Look at the color of the furniture that you want to buy and think of how it would look against the color of your room.  , When your friends come over and hang out, you don't want them to sit on the floor. Buy some chairs so that you and your friends have a comfy spot to sit. You can buy some beanbag chairs, or a moon chair. Even an ottoman would work well, especially if it has storage space inside. Try to keep your furniture within your color scheme.  , Give it to a charity, or if you want some profit, sell it online on websites such as Amazon, eBay or one of a small number of third-party sellers online., Put the bedside table by your bed, The couch on the opposite side of your desk etc., If you have a carpeted floor, this may not be as necessary, but a cool rug or two is never a bad thing to have in your room. If you have hardwood floors, rugs are a really good thing to put beside your bed so that when you get up in the morning your feet don't freeze on the hardwood floor. Remember, choose rugs that express your personality, and have fun with the designs and patterns.   Buy a fuzzy rug, some flourishing curtains for the windows, a lamp for the bedside table, and more!  , Buy some bed sheets and pillows for your bed. If you want a really girly-looking bed, buy some blankets and a bunch of toss pillows to put at the head of your bed. If you want a more simplistic look, just stick with the bed sheets. Do whatever you want. Just because you're a girl doesn't mean that you have to be a 'girly-girl'.   Buy some funky blankets with some adjoining cushions for your bed.  , Mirrors aren't just for girly-girls. If you love makeup, a good mirror will be handy when you're putting your makeup on. You can buy a full-length mirror so that you can see your outfits, too. Buy a mirror that has a cool frame, such as a mosaic with different colors of glass.  , Cork boards are really cool, because you can display photos of your family, you, your friends, your pets, as well as other things like concert tickets and postcards. If your cork board is ugly, paint it a color that goes with your room, but not a very dark color, or put some cool fabric over it. You can also buy cork boards with fabric over them already.  , Put up posters of your favorite bands and celebrities. Put up pictures of your family and friends. Put in stuff that you like and that gives your room personality! Art projects, sketches, whatever you want. If you're the artist type put up your drawings, or paintings. Make it yours; after all, it is your room.  , Add lamps and maybe some dangling lights, such as butterfly or fairy lights. Fairy lights can be improved by sticking on motifs in the intervals between the lights., Use space in your closet or make another spot in your room for keeping your stuff out of the way. Buy some storage bins and slide them under your bed. This keeps all of your stuff organized.  , Shelves are a must to display stuff like sports trophies, pictures, books, etc. Buy some shelves and have them put up in a place that you like, such as over your bed or near your desk.  , They can be donated, go into storage or be disposed of. Unless they mean a great deal of value to you, having such things hanging around can cause you to keep living in the past; now is the time to move on. If you have anything you wouldn't use again or isn't special to you, donate it to a charity shop.  , Play some slow music from your iPod on your stereo, and pour a cool glass of lemonade. Grab a book or magazine and sit back and relax on your bed.

"[""ask the bedwetter how they feel about this.talk to the bedwetter and tell them that you are considering getting the bedwetter's siblings to help out with washing their diapers and plastic pants"", 'realize that boys and girls develop at different times', ""talk to the bedwetter's older sibling(s) and get a feel for how they would deal with this issue"", 'parents need to be aware of the possibility that an older child might be a bit reluctant to involve their older siblings in such a private matter', 'after talking to the siblings and the son or daughter with the bedwetting problem you can talk to everyone together as a group', ""that way everyone knows the ground rules - what's to be expected of the siblings doing the laundry"", ""that there's to be no teasing of the bedwetter(s)"", ""where the bedwetter(s) is to place the wet diapers and plastic pants when they're ready to be laundered"", 'etc', ""if the parents are going to wash the diapers and plastic pants all at once they'll need to purchase a diaper pail""]",How to Involve Older Siblings With Laundering a Bedwetting Sibling's Diapers and Plastic Pants," Let them know that you are doing this because it will make doing the laundry easier.Many bedwetters are self-conscious about their bedwetting and the fact that they have to wear diapers and plastic pants to bed. Having an older sibling help out with laundering the diapers and plastic pants might be embarrassing,that's why it's important to put their mind at ease about the whole situation.; , Studies show that girls tend to mature faster than boys and might be more mature about handling this type of situation. Also, the girl's maternal instinct tends to come into play, so they might be more sympathetic than a boy when it comes to helping out the parents with this chore. If the bedwetter is a boy, they might feel more comfortable with a girl dealing with this issue. On the other hand it could go the other way.My hunch is that a girl would be able to handle this in a more mature manner and be more empathetic about their brother or sister wearing diapers and plastic pants to manage their bedwetting. That being the case,this is just a rule of thumb and the parents have to gauge this based on their knowledge of the particular situation at hand.  , If you feel they would be able to do this chore in a responsible, adult manner, then by all means, get them to help out in some way. I would say something along these lines: “I wanted to talk to you guys (if there's more than one daughter helping out) about something. I know you've noticed me laundering plastic pants (or ""rubber pants"" as they're sometimes called - you may know them by that term) and cloth diapers, you've seen plastic pants hanging on the clothesline, as well as me folding diapers and plastic pants up and putting them in a laundry basket. Your brother has problems with bedwetting and he has to wear protection to bed. He uses pin-on cloth diapers covered with plastic pants to keep the bed dry. The reason I'm telling you this is because I would like you to help me with washing the diapers and plastic pants on the weekend. It would really help me out a lot if you'd pitch in with this. One of you can be responsible for laundering the diapers and plastic pants and one of you can hang the plastic pants on the clothesline to dry then fold the diapers and plastic pants up and put them in the laundry basket. Or we can have one person be responsible for both laundering the diapers and plastic pants as well as folding them up and putting them in the laundry basket. In this case all of you can take turns with this chore – one of you will be responsible for doing this one weekend, the next weekend someone else will take care of the wet garments, etc. I'll leave it up to you to decide amongst yourselves how you want to handle this. I'll show you how to launder them. This is a very delicate matter guys - he feels embarrassed about wearing diapers and plastic pants at his age so I want you all to be sensitive about his feelings. I want you to treat it like it's no big deal.” This is just an example of how you can approach the siblings. Obviously the dialog might need to be modified depending on how many people are involved in the chore, whether or not the bedwetter is a boy or girl, and if there's more than one bedwetter.  , The older the bedwetter is the more embarrassed they might feel about this. A 12 year old that wets the bed and needs to wear pin-on cloth diapers covered by plastic pants might be more reluctant to have their older siblings take care of the diapers and plastic pants as opposed to a five year old.This is not say that parents should not involve older siblings with helping out in laundering an older bedwetter's diapers and plastic pants, just that they need to be sensitive to the older child's feelings.If the bedwetter is embarrassed about their older sibling or siblings being involved in this situation the parent or parents can say something along these lines: ""You shouldn't be ashamed about your older sibling(s) taking care of your wet clothing. They just want to help mom(or dad) out. I've talked to them about the whole situation and I think that they'll be able to handle this in a mature and thoughtful manner. Also,I've let them know that I will not tolerate any teasing about you wearing the diapers and plastic pants.""  , This might make the bedwetter(s) feel more at ease as well because he or she knows what to expect., On the day the diapers and plastic pants are to be laundered, have the bedwetter bring the diaper pail to the sibling or siblings who are going to be responsible for taking care of them. Another option is to tell the bedwetter and the siblings that there will be a designated place set up in the laundry room for the bedwetter to put the diaper pail.

Write down your notes or use a voice recorder to document any thoughts or impressions you have of the book as you are reading. They don't have to be organised or perfect, the idea is to brainstorm any impressions you may have of the book.  , Consider how the book fits or does not fit in it's genre or field of study. If necessary, use outside sources to familiarize yourself with the field of study and the genre of the book.   For example, if you are reviewing a non-fiction book about the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s, consider reading other books that also examine the same scientific issue and period of scientific development. Or if you are reviewing a work of fiction like Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, consider how Hawthorne's book relates to other works of romanticism and historical fiction set in the same time period (the 17th century) as points of comparison.  , The theme is often a lesson or overall message that the reader perceives between the lines. The theme can also be the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a book. Authors may present multiple themes in their writing, especially works of fiction.   Pay attention to the preface, any quotes, and /or references in the book's introduction, as this content will likely shed light on the book's major themes and viewpoint. A simple way to determine one of the major themes of a book is to sum up the book in one word.So, for example, the major theme of The Scarlet Letter could be ""sin"". Once you have your one word summary, stretch the single word into a message or lesson, such as ""sin can lead to knowledge but it can also lead to suffering.""  , Ask yourself if the style suits the book's intended audience. Remember that genre is a category of writing and style is the manner in which a subject is expressed or performed. So, depending on the style used, the author can present different viewpoints to the intended audience.   For example, in The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne attempts to combine the writing style of the Romantic Period (1800-1855) with the common, every day language of the American Puritans of the 1600s. Hawthorne does this with long, descriptive sentences that are strung together with commas and semi-colons, and he also uses antiquated word choices and descriptors that are rooted in the Romantic period and in Puritan terms inspired by the Bible., What areas are covered/not covered? Why? Locating gaps in the timeframe or character development of the book can help you think critically. As well, noticing any well developed elements of the book will help you create good points for your review.  , Elements like the book's layout, binding, typography, etc. can provide framing and context for the book. If the author provides secondary material like maps, charts, and drawings, always consider how they support or contribute to the book's themes.   In the Scarlet Letter, for example, Hawthorne begins the book with an introduction to the text, narrated by an individual who has many autobiographical details in common with the author. In the introduction, the nameless narrator tells the story of finding the manuscript bundled in a scarlet letter ""A"". Hawthorne uses this narrative framing to create a story within a story, an important detail when discussing the book as a whole.  , If the book is a work of fiction, think about how plot structure is developed in the story. Take notes on the book's character, plot, setting, symbols, mood or tone and how they relate to the overall theme of the book.   If we were to use the Scarlett Letter again, it would be important to note that Hawthorne chose the adulterer and sinner Hester Prynne as his protagonist, and placed the religious, anti sin Reverend Wilson in the role of antagonist. In writing a review of The Scarlet Letter, it would be useful to consider why Hawthorne did this, and how it relates back to the book's overall theme of sin.  , Does it add new information to a genre? The author may be trying to challenge or expand the existing rules and norms of a genre. Consider how the book does this, and how this may affect the intended audience's reception of the book.  , Was the author successful in carrying out the overall purposes of the book and did you feel satisfied with the book's ending? Would you recommend this book to others?  , Most reviews start off with a heading that includes all the bibliographic information about the book. If you haven't been directed on heading format from an editor or professor, use the standard heading of: title, author, place of publication: publisher, date of publication, and number of pages. , A good introduction will grab the reader's attention so they are interested in reading the rest of the review, and will inform the reader what the review is going to be about.Ensure your introduction contains relevant details like the author's background, and if applicable, their previous work in the genre. You can also indicate the main themes you will be discussing in your review to situate the reader and give them an indication of your ""take"" on the book. Several possible openings include: a historical moment, an anecdote, a surprising or intriguing statement, and declarative statements.Regardless of your opening sentences, make sure they directly relate to your critical response to the book and keep them short and to the point. If you're unsure on how to begin the review, try writing your introduction last. It may be easier to organize all of your supporting points and your critical position, and then write the introduction last—that way you can be sure that the introduction will match the body of the review., Once you have established your heading and your introduction, you can then move into a summary of the book's themes and main points.   Keep the summary short, to the point, and informative. Use quotes or paraphrasing from the book to support your summary.Make sure you properly cite all quotes and paraphrasing in your review to avoid plagiarism.Be wary of summaries that begin with phrases like “is about…” “is the story of…” “writes about…”.Focus on weaving a description of the book's setting, narrative voice, and plot within a critical analysis. Avoid simply regurgitating the book's premise. Don't give away important details or reveal the ending of the book in your summary, and don't go into detail about what happens from the middle of the book onwards. As well, if the book is part of a series, you can mention this to potential readers and situate the book within the series. , Once you have summarized the book and discussed the main themes and aspects, shift into your critical analysis. This the heart of your review, so be as direct and clear as you can.   Use the answers you brainstormed during your preparation for the review to formulate your critique. Address how well the book has achieved its goal, how the book compares to other books on the subject, specific points that were not convincing or lacked development, and what personal experiences, if any, you've had related to the subject of the book.Always use (properly cited) supporting quotes and passages from the book to back up your critical discussion. This not only reinforces your viewpoint with a trustworthy source, it also gives the reader a sense of the writing style and narrative voice of the book.The general rule of thumb is that the first one-half to two-thirds of the review should summarize the author’s main ideas and at least one-third should evaluate the book., Write a concluding paragraph or several sentences that sum up your critical analysis of the book. If your critical position has been well argued, the conclusion should follow naturally.   Examine the strengths and weaknesses of the book, and discuss whether or not you would recommend the book to others. If so, who do you think is the ideal audience for the book?Do not introduce new material in your conclusion or discuss a new idea or impression that was not examined in your introduction and body paragraphs.You can also give the book a numerical score, a thumbs up or thumbs down, or a starred rating., Your first stab at a book review may not be as perfect as you'd like, so feel free to revise and adjust your draft. To gain perspective, put the review aside for a few days and then come back to it with fresh eyes.   Always use spell check and adjust any grammar or spelling. Nothing undermines a quality review more than bad spelling and grammar. Double check that all quotes and references are properly cited in your review.  , If possible, get someone else to read the review before you submit it to an editor or turn it in to a professor. It is difficult to edit and critique your own work, so ask a friend to read your review and then tell you if they felt the introduction grabbed their attention and if your critical discussion was consistent and developed throughout your review.  , Make sure you incorporate your revisions and any feedback you have received to create the best final draft. A good review will flow well from introduction to summary to critical analysis, have an interesting perspective on the book, and be free of any grammatical or spelling errors to ensure it is easy to read.

You should also know what they want or need to learn from you. This will affect your teaching approach, as well as what you actually teach.   For example, if you are teaching elementary school kids, you might focus on basic grammar rules that are easy to grasp. If you are teaching adults who are learning English as a second language, you might find these students to be older and highly motivated. They also may need immediate language skills.; , People learn in different ways depending on how they process information most effectively. Think about different styles of learning as you begin to plan how to teach grammar. Some of these learning styles include:Visual learning: These learners prefer reading and want to see what they’re learning. Auditory learning: These learners prefer to listen to instruction. Conversations and interactions are effective ways of teaching this learning style. Tactile learning: These learners prefer to touch and manipulate objects in order to learn about something. Kinesthetic learning: These learners move around a lot and benefit from getting up from a desk frequently.  , Take some time to go through a grammar guide or textbook. Even if you think you know grammar really well, spend some time refreshing your memory about different rules.  , You might choose to use a textbook as a guide for teaching. Choose one that is geared toward the same type of students that you will be teaching.  , The deductive approach of teaching grammar focuses on teaching certain grammar rules and then giving examples of that rule.It can be useful if you want to quickly explain grammar. It may be more useful with adult students.   This approach can minimize student interaction and involvement. Clearly state what the rule allows and limits. Give a clear and brief explanation about what the grammar rule allows. Also describe what the rule does not allow. For example, always use “you were” and never use “you was.” Then follow up with an example of the rule. Illustrate the grammar rule with an example. You can use a simple sentence to illustrate it once. Then you might choose a more complicated sentence to demonstrate how the rule applies. Describe the rules with simplicity. Boil down the grammatical rules to simple terms. Try not to point out too many exceptions to the rule when you first introduce the rule.  , The inductive approach allows students to discover how language and grammar works. Students learn grammar by making connections with their pre-existing understanding of language. For example, students learning English as a second language will learn to link English grammar rules to their native language grammar rules.   This approach may allow for better memory retention of grammar. In addition, students are more autonomous learners. Don’t choose the inductive approach if you don’t have lots of time. Students need to work out a rule on their own by going through examples. Figuring out the rule may be at the expense of using the rule in practice. Give sentence examples that demonstrate differences. In order to help students pick out the rules, start with two sentences that have slightly different meanings.For example, write: “I have read every Stephen King book,” and “I read Stephen King’s latest book last week.” Ask the student to identify the difference between these two sentences.  , The functional approach focuses on teaching grammar so that the students can function in their everyday lives. For example, what will they need to know so that they can go grocery shopping? How will they greet someone?Beginning students can learn complex concepts and use them in conversation. In this approach, it can be difficult to determine what aspects to focus on first.  , Use examples of literature and popular writing to illustrate how grammar is used. This can be an effective way to teach grammar.Students can choose their own texts or stories that they’d like to use. This will make the lesson more interesting for the students. Students will also benefit from increased vocabulary. The texts can be difficult if they are too advanced for the student’s language level.  , A singular noun is a word that describes one thing. Plural means that there are more than one thing. In most instances, add an ‘s’ to the end of the singular noun to make it plural.When teaching basic rules, mention that there are exceptions. But you don’t need to go into them at this point.  , Pronouns are words that replace someone’s name. For example, Mary will become “she” and Harry will become “he.” These two together will become “they.” Continue with the other pronouns, such as “I,” “you,” “we,” “us,” and so on.  , Conjugating verbs is an essential skill to understanding how to make sentences match up. This involves making a verb match the subject. For example, when you have the verb “jump,” it will be conjugated as: “I jump,” “you jump,” he jumps,” and so on.   Start with the present tense first and give the student lots of practice using this tense. Move onto past and future tense one at a time.  , There are some irregular verbs that don’t follow the regular verb conjugation rules. One of these is “to be.” Teach this as: “I am,” “you are,” “he is,” and so on.   Start with teaching the present tense first. Irregular verbs can be tricky. In addition, “to be” serves as a foundation for many other types of verb phrases. It’s important to master it before moving on.  , If the student wants to disagree with something or say she did not do something, she will need to know how to construct that sentence. Show the student where to add “not” in a sentence. For example, you might say, “I am not jumping” or “I am not eating.”  , Diagramming a sentence is a useful exercise to help students understand how sentences are constructed.Find the subject and predicate (verb) of the sentence. Find direct objects and indirect objects. Discuss which words alter the meaning of other words.  Identify dependent and independent clauses.  , Once your students have grasped present, past and future verb tenses, introduce them to other types of verb conjugations. These might include present perfect simple, past progressive, present progressive, present conditional, past conditional, and so on., When you’re teaching beginning grammar, it might be better to use simple terms to describe concepts. As you teach more advanced grammar, you may choose to start introducing the proper terms that describe grammatical concepts.  , Periodically, assess your students’ learning with quizzes. This will give them a chance to put their knowledge to the test. This also gives you a chance to see how well they are learning the concepts. You will also see if concepts are confusing to students.  , Take examples from sentences so that they make sense to the student. It is helpful to see how grammar rules are put into practice in different types of conversations or writings.  , Explain grammatical rules by using concepts that the student already knows.For example, students will likely be familiar with verb tenses, such as past, present and future. Use these as ways to explain more complicated verb tenses.  , Reinforce your lesson by giving the students lots of time to put their grammar knowledge to use. The point of learning grammar is to improve communication skills. Give your students the opportunity to practice frequently.  , It is important to take note of your students’ learning levels, interests and styles. When you tailor your instruction to their level, they will be more invested in learning grammar. This will also reduce frustration and confusion for both the students and yourself., Grammar can be a dry subject if the teacher doesn’t engage the students effectively. Play games, plan conversation scenarios and do other activities that are appropriate and fun for the students.  , Do not discourage your students by correcting their grammar in a way that reduces their desire to speak. Instead, correct errors by continuing the conversation and asking questions using the correct grammar.For example, your student says, “I catched the ball.” Don’t respond with “You mean, you caught the ball.” Instead, say, “You caught the ball? Did you score a point?” Continue the conversation with a gentle correction and an added question or comment.

Take long deep breaths, filling up your lungs from the bottom up as often as possible. After your breathe deeply, apply a little bit of pressure from your diaphragm to project your voice effortlessly. To understand how to use your diaphragm correctly, pretend that you are blowing candles on a birthday cake. The downward motion felt in the abdomen is the diaphragm engaging. Just a little bit of pressure is necessary to support the voice. Let your belly out when inhaling and always push down slightly (not in) while exhaling.; , The placement and pitch of your voice should sit in the middle of your range. Be mindful of not speaking too low, too high, too nasal or with rasp. To find your natural dynamic voice, answer a few questions positively with “Mmmm”. There you go! That is your natural pitch. Try to speak at that level most of the time.  , Take time to pause often in order to take long deep breaths. Slowing down your speech and carefully enunciating allows your instrument to align itself and relax open its resonance chamber.  , Drink 5 to 6 bottles of water a day to maintain the elasticity of your vocal cords. This is the daily recommended amount. Avoid drying agents such as caffeinated drinks and soda. Gargle water to hydrate and massage your throat instantly!  , Try to pick up on signs of vocal fatigue early and be pro-active. Rasp, the frequent need to clear the throat, change in tone, and soreness are evident signs of irritation. If you notice these, pause and take a moment to realign yourself.  , Do not smoke or use drugs, eat healthy, and exercise regularly. To protect yourself from catching the common cold or flu, wash your hands often and keep them away from your face. Consult your family doctor or an ear, nose and throat specialist if vocal issues continue for more than 3 weeks or other health concerns.  , Try not to speak between lectures or long periods of vocal usage at work, especially when you feel vocal fatigue or you are getting sick. Stay home if you catch a cold or the flu and do not talk!  , Demand silence from your audience before initiating a lecture. Wait for quiet environments for private conversations as opposed to clubs for example.  , Learn to love your voice! Completely let go of the ego and accept that it's OK to make mistakes and that we cannot be perfect all the time.  Proper guidance, solid technique and daily practice should fix any concerns you may have.  Determination and perseverance will take you a long way.  Set realistic goals for yourself, create opportunities and go after what you want in life.  Only you can do it.  You can make it happen!  , Read books, blogs and take vocal lessons with a singing teacher or speech therapist. Make an appointment with an ear, nose and throat Specialist if you have concerns about damage to your vocal cords.  ,","['professional advice', 'natural dynamic singing voice', 'health', 'speaking voice', 'good care', 'natural speaking voice placement', 'problems', 'speech', 'body', 'crowd', 'voice']"

Look into taking up a new hobby in the aftermath of rejection. Strive to keep busy throughout the day. If you don't keep busy, you're likely to start ruminating and having negative thoughts about yourself and the guy.Take up hobbies you enjoy. If you're interested in knitting, start a new knitting project. If you're an outdoorsy type, take up hiking. Try to keep busy with a hobby during most of the day when you have downtime. When you're likely to start engaging with troublesome thoughts, find something to do. If you're lying awake at night pondering what went wrong and why, read a book instead or listen to a podcast on your phone.; , Meeting new people and exploring new activities can also keep your mind occupied. Consider joining a class in and getting involved in your community. Stop by a local community center and see what they offer. Something like, say, a cooking class can help you expand your social circle and make new friends. A new social circle can keep your mind off the guy who rejected you. Eventually, your feelings for him will taper off.  , You cannot entirely eliminate or control your feelings. However, changing the way you think about your internal feelings can help you gain some distance from them. Try thinking of your feelings as a third party rather than a part of yourself. This can help you gain some distance.Think about your feeling as an intrusive third party who continually interrupts your thoughts and emotions. If you're having an otherwise good day, and suddenly unwanted thoughts arise, think to yourself, ""Here comes that force again to bother me."" This can feel awkward at first, but with some practice you'll be able to do it somewhat unconsciously. This can provide you with appropriate distance from your emotions, allowing you to move forward.  , Heartbreak can be a major inspiration for artistic pursuits. If you're already an artistic person by nature, put your heartbreak into your work. If you've never been particularly artistically inclined before, take your heartbreak as an opportunity to try your hand at something like painting, drawing, or writing.Write about unrequited love. If you're a musician, a poet, or some other kind of writer, rejection can make for a great poem, story, or song. Paint or draw. Many people, who think in more abstract terms, find painting or drawing out their feelings helps them cope. Find whatever art form feels natural to you and let your frustrations and heartbreak act as your muse.  , It may be hard to find a serious relationship when you're healing from loss. However, casual dating can be helpful. Going on a few casual dates can help you feel attractive and wanted again. This may make your feelings of loss less painful.Ask your friends to set you up with someone. They may know someone in a similar situations who's looking for light, casual dating. You can also try online dating, if you're comfortable. Just make sure you meet any new, romantic partner in a public place before meeting them in private. You can also go to a social event alone and try to flirt with a stranger.  , Once you're ready to cope with your feelings, accept that you will be feeling pain. Rejection hurts everyone, and you cannot ignore the pain indefinitely. Spend some time accepting that you're hurt, and coping with negative feeling instead of pushing them down.Accept you've been hurt and take care of yourself. Allow yourself time to grieve. Try to be kind to yourself. Give yourself a treat, like a long walk alone or a soothing bath. Do not expect too much from yourself too soon. You may feel sad for awhile and down on yourself for awhile. This is all very normal. Do not put too much pressure on yourself to snap out of it. Allow yourself to grieve.  , Sometimes, it can help to know other people have been in a similar situation. Most people, at some point in their lives, will have unrequited feelings for another person. Try to remember your situation is common and other people have dealt with it and moved forward.It can help to reach out to others. If you know someone who's been hurt in a similar way, talk to him or her. Talking to older relatives can also help. Many people, at a younger age, struggled with unrequited romances. Try reaching out to people older than you.  , It's easier said than done, but you need to take steps not to take rejection personally. Just as you cannot control how you feel, the guy cannot either. A lot of love and attraction comes down to very personal, subjective preferences. Just because you're not right for this one person does not mean you're not right for anyone.If you find yourself ruminating over the why of rejection, remind yourself you do not know. You may be inclined to think, ""If only I was skinnier/smarter/funnier"" but the reality is, you do not know why someone rejected you. You should also remind yourself the guy may not know either. Sometimes, you just don't have those kinds of feelings for someone and you do not know why.  , When searching for reasons why things did not work out, you may be inclined to blame the guy. You may find yourself thinking negative thoughts about him, like, ""If he wasn't so shallow, he would have wanted me."" However, keep in mind feelings are subjective. Chances are, the guy did not reject you for any particular reason. There are a litany of reasons someone may not be interested in you in a given moment. People do not control feelings. Try to accept that, while the guy is not interested in you, he's ultimately a good person and it's not his fault he lacks romantic interest in you at this time.  , It's very hard to get over someone if you see them frequently. As you're trying to stop feeling your feelings, lessen contact with the guy in question.How you decide to taper off contact is up to you. You may not need to cut the person out totally, depending on your feelings, but you can make up some guidelines for yourself in terms of how you proceed. For example, you can limit yourself to seeing this person once every couple of weeks instead of once a week. You can stop texting this person every day or talking to them on social media for awhile.  , You may be the type to continually fall for unavailable people. For some, falling for those they cannot have is a pattern of behavior. If you had a childhood where adults were not reliable, you may unconsciously seek out unavailable people as an adult.Have you ever been in this situation before? Do you frequently fall for people who are not interested in you? If so, this may be a pattern for you. Examine your past. Think about your childhood and whether you felt a sense of security there. If you did not, you may be falling for unavailable people as a defense mechanism to prevent yourself from ever getting close enough to really get hurt. If you feel like this is a pattern for you, consider seeing a therapist. A qualified therapist can help you sort through your past and help you make better relationship decisions down the road.  , If you're going through a rough patch, it's important to seek support from others. Talk to friends and family members who care about you. This can help you feel you've loved, wanted, and needed, even if you're not involved with someone romantically in the present moment.

"['dispel the myths about your growing breasts', 'be proud of your changing body', 'learn how to deal with teasing or bullying', 'beware of neck pain', 'consider your breast cancer risk', 'take care of your mental health', 'know when and how to treat breast pain']",How to Deal With Getting Big Breasts2," Unfortunately there are a lot of odd myths out there about how breasts develop and whether you have any control over their size. In general, you have no control over when your breasts develop, or what size they’ll end up being. There are no exercises you can do to make your breasts turn out larger or smaller. Breasts are made most of fatty tissue and milk ducts, not muscle. Sleeping on your stomach will not impact your breasts in any way (although if they’re tender, this might be uncomfortable).There is also nothing that a bra can do to make your breasts larger or smaller, even if you wear it at night while you sleep (which is not needed)., Developing breasts isn’t something you’re able to hide, for too long. Chances are people other than yourself will eventually notice. You may feel stressed and unsure about these changes and what other people will think of you. These feelings are perfectly normal.Try not to compare yourself to girls you see on TV or the internet, there is no reason you have to look like anyone other than yourself. Don’t compare yourself to advertisements. The models in these ads are unrealistic, and most have been photoshopped. You don’t need to look like anyone other than yourself. Remember that you are beautiful, no matter what. And yes, real beauty comes from the inside! If you need to, remind yourself of these things every day. These feelings are normal, so don’t be upset that you feel them. However, even if you’re on an emotional rollercoaster, try not to allow it to affect your health. Eat properly, get plenty of sleep, and exercise regularly. If you’re unable to do one or more of these things, talk to your parents, teacher, school counsellor/nurse, or doctor as soon as you can.  , The age that you go through puberty is usually also an age when you’re becoming aware of how you look and how you fit in. When you body starts to change in all sorts of weird ways, it adds to your stress about what’s normal and what’s not. You parents may at times forget what it was like to be you age and experience all these changes and pressures. This is your chance to remind them, if they haven’t already figured it out. Tell them that what you’re going through isn’t funny and jokes should not be made. At school you may experience other students saying mean things about how you look, or making rude comments about the body parts that are changing. Keep in mind that most of the kids who make these types of comments are insecure themselves, and they’re making these comments out of jealousy and fear.Find a worthwhile role model. Maybe your role model is an older sister, or aunt, or favorite teacher. Someone who doesn’t follow the so-called stereotypes, but want to simply be themselves.  , Larger breasts can potentially lead to neck pain. However, it’s not a direct cause and effect situation. It’s not the physical size of your breasts that may cause neck pain, but rather the subconscious things you’re doing because of your breast size that are causing the problem. For example, if your embarrassed about your breasts, you might tend to slouch. And it’s the slouching and bad posture that can lead to neck pain. Sometimes the slouching posture isn’t due to lack of confidence, but to the actual weight of your breasts. If you have large, heavy breasts it can cause you to slump forwards, which in turn causes your neck and back muscles to become painful and can even put your spine out of alignment. Finally, the wrong bra can cause all sorts of problems. If you’re wearing a bra whose straps are digging into your shoulder, it might be causing you to crunch of your neck and shoulders together. This bad posture in turn leads to back and neck pain.Being happy with your breasts will likely make your present yourself with better posture because of your confidence. Getting a better fitting bra could potentially solve some of these problems. Getting large breast implants can actually create some of these problems. It is one of the many things you should consider before deciding to get large breasts via surgery.  , If your breasts have gotten bigger because you’ve gained weight, you may want to consider losing the weight again. Women who gained 30-40 pounds after the age of 18, but before menopause, were 40% more likely to develop breast cancer after menopause. The reason weight gain increases breast cancer risk is because of the increased estrogen hormones present in your body due to the excess fat. Weight gain is also normally related to lack of activity, and lack of activity can also increase your risk of breast cancer.The best way to eliminate this risk is to lose weight before menopause, or immediately after menopause has started. To help reduce your breast cancer risk, and help you lose weight, consider doing moderate to vigorous exercise for 45-60 minutes 5 days a week.  , Larger breasts (or uneven breasts) can actually cause some women to experience mental health problems like low self-esteem or eating disorders. A woman’s self image of her breasts can have a huge effect on her self-confidence. Unfortunately there is no physical side effect associated with many of these breast issues, which is why surgery to correct many of these problems are not covered by insurance. But many surgeons have seen a remarkable mental health change in women who have had various breast problems fixed by surgery.If you’re experiencing issues with your breasts that are leading to mental health issues, but not physical issues, they are not less important, and you may wish to consider investigating what surgical options are available to you.  , Breast pain, also known as mastalgia, is actually quite common for all women, regardless of breast size. It can include tenderness, burning sensations, or tightness. It can be relatively mild, or it can be downright torturous. Thankfully most breast pain is not an indicator of any major problems like breast cancer.Most breast pain is caused by hormone levels, the structure and traumatic history of your breasts (e.g. previous breast surgery, etc.), certain medications (e.g. oral contraceptives, fertility treatments, hormone therapy, antidepressants, etc.), and breast size.If you’re experiencing any breast pain that you are concerned about, see your doctor. They can perform a breast exam and consider doing mammograms or ultrasounds to investigate further.Possibly treatments can include: topical anti-inflammatory medication, changes to hormone therapy levels, prescription medications, reduction of medications that are causing the problem, hot/cold compresses, reduced caffeine intake, low-fat diet, etc.","['breast pain', 'teasing', 'proud', 'neck pain', 'breasts', 'care', 'myths', 'breast cancer risk', 'body', 'mental health', 'bullying']"
"['prepare a soil mix', 'plant anthurium in a pot 1/3 full of this soil mix', 'keep in a warm or hot location', 'with indirect sun', 'keep the air humid', 'keep the soil moist', 'but not soaked', 'provide a stake if the anthurium is drooping', 'fertilize your anthurium plant cautiously', 'transfer to a larger pot whenever necessary', 'start with seeds for an added challenge', 'harvest ripe anthurium fruit', 'remove the pulp', 'prepare a potting mix for the seeds', 'plant the seeds and potting mix in a flowerpot or tray', 'with a clear covering', 'lightly moisten the potting mix', 'keep in a warm environment', 'away from direct sunlight']",How to Grow Anthurium Plants," Anthurium prefers a coarse, well-draining soil. Try a mixture of equal parts perlite, peat moss, and pine bark.Alternatively, combine three parts potting mix with one part coarse material such as orchid bark or lava rock.If the anthurium plant is at least a year old, it may prefer an even coarser material, achieved by adding a handful of crumbled aquarium charcoal, coarse river sand, or small pieces of broken brick.   Anthurium plants can only grow outdoors in USDA Hardiness Zones 11 and 12, corresponding to minimum annual temperatures of 40ºF (4.4ºC) or higher.In any other climate, use a flowerpot and keep them indoors. The ideal temperature range for anthurium is 60-85ºF (15-30ºC).; , The anthurium plant should be kept in a pot only slightly larger than itself, or its roots may rot and die.Fill a pot 1/3 of the way full with the prepared potting mix and place the anthurium on top. Fill in with additional potting mix around the sides. Typically, the roots of the plant will continue to grow above the potting material, so begin with this low level of fill to delay the need to transplant your anthurium to a larger pot.If you are using a potting mix with less coarse material or worse drainage, consider one or two layers of pebbles at the base of the container to speed up water drainage.  , Anthurium plants thrive in daytime temperatures between 80 and 90ºF (27–32ºC). If this is not possible, the plant will typically survive indoors at temperatures above 60ºF (15.5ºC), but warmer is better.Avoid direct sun, which may burn the plant, but keep it in a bright location to encourage blooming. A south- or east-facing windowsill is a good option (north- or east-facing if you are in the Southern Hemisphere).Place the plant 5–8 feet (1.5–2.4 m) (1.5-2.5m) from a window for some gentle sunlight. If night temperatures dip below 40ºF (4.4ºC), the leaves may yellow and growth will likely slow. The plant rarely survives long if temperatures fall below freezing (32ºF / 0ºC).Do not keep plants directly in front of heaters and heating vents, which may burn them.  , Mimic the humid, tropical environment of anthurium plants by keeping the room at 80% humidity or higher.Placing the pot in an aquarium or a shallow tray of pebbles in water will help achieve a high level of humidity. Mist the plant weekly, or daily if you live in a dry climate, making sure to spray portions of the stem that have grown over the lip of the pot., Water in small amounts as necessary to prevent the soil from drying out. Even in hot weather, the soil does not need watering more than once every two or three days, as the plant does not soak up large amounts of water from its roots.   If the leaves turn yellow (but not brown and withered), this may be a sign of overwatering. Let the soil dry out before watering again if this occurs., Most anthurium plants in nature, but probably the minority sold as houseplants, are ""epiphytic,"" meaning they grow on other plants instead of in soil. If your plant is vine-like and failing to support itself, use a stake or other wooden object for the plant to climb up. You do not need to move epiphytic anthurium out of the soil; it will not cause them harm., Newly planted anthurium should not need fertilizer for at least a few months. If you decide to apply fertilizer to encourage vivid colors and growth, use a slow release 3:1:2 fertilizer and dilute it to 1/4 the recommended strength before applying according to the instructions.You can fertilize your anthurium every other time you water it, or as needed.  , Anthurium plants often build up a mound of roots above the surface of the soil. About once a year, or if the soil begins to dry out rapidly between watering, pack a layer of peat or sphagnum moss over the lower 1/2 or 2/3 of the exposed stem. Keep this layer moist and wait for roots to grow out of the buried portion of the stem. Once they have extended throughout this layer, cut the stem with a clean, sharp knife at the base of the soil mixture, and transfer the buried stem into a new pot, with the buried stem below the level of the soil.Remember, pot anthurium in a container only 1/3 full of soil, so the stem is below the rim of the pot.  , Commercially grown anthurium are typically propagated using cuttings and grafts. It is possible to grow anthurium from seeds, but the resulting plant may have unpredictable characteristics if it was produced by a hybrid mother plant, and may be more difficult to grow. Outside of tropical areas, it may be difficult to even locate fresh anthurium seeds.   If you are growing an anthurium cutting or an adult plant, skip to the start of another section.  , Anthurium seeds must be fresh and moist when planted.If you do not have an anthurium plant yourself, ask another gardener or garden store whether you can collect some of their plants' fruits, which are rarely used. If you live in a tropical New World region, you may be able to harvest wild anthurium plants. There are hundreds if not thousands of anthurium species, so you may wish to refer to a local plant identification booklet.    Warning: The fruit, along with all other parts of the anthurium plant, are toxic and should not be eaten.  , The pulp of the fruit, surrounding the seed, may prevent the seed from growing or cause mold. Rub off as much pulp as you can with your fingers, then drop the seed into a cup of water. Leave it in there for a day or two while the pulp material detaches and floats to the top.Warning: Some species of anthurium may irritate the skin. Using gloves is recommended.  , Prepare a potting mix with equal parts sphagnum peat moss, pearlite and pine bark. The soil needs of anthurium seeds are similar to the needs of adult plants.  , Anthurium plants are native to the tropics, and require warm, humid environments. There are a couple different ways you can recreate this environment:   Place the potting mix in 4 inch (10 centimeter) flowerpots. Place a seed on the surface of the soil, one per flowerpot, and place a glass canning jar upside down over each pot.Or layer the bottom of a shallow, earthenware tray with your prepared potting mix. Scatter the seeds evenly over this, and cover with a flat sheet of glass or plastic over the tray, leaving a gap of air between the sheet and the soil., Wet the potting mix slightly, then cover with the clear barrier as described above to keep the environment moist. Wetting the mossy mixture may also help prevent the seed from sinking beneath the surface, which reduces the likelihood of germination.   If tap water in your area is hard, use bottled water instead.  , Keep the potting mix at a temperature of about 80ºF (27ºC), in an area of indirect sun or partial shade. Keep the soil moist while you wait for the seeds to germinate, as they are very vulnerable to drying out at this stage. Within about 20–30 days, the seeds should sprout and grow their first root and leaves, after which they can be moved to a larger container and cared for, as described above.Move the young plant carefully, as the roots may be fragile. Ideally, use a scoop to pick up the mossy material surrounding the plant, and drop this gently onto the new pot after preparing it as described below.

Formatting the case caption properly will ensure your affidavit is recognized by the attorneys, prosecutors and legal clerks.   To create a case caption, start by creating a centered heading that identifies the court venue. For example, ""Supreme Court of New Jersey."" Next write the names of the defendants and plaintiffs, positioned below and to the left of the heading. If you do not know the names, find a copy of another legal document filed in the case, such as the complaint. Write the case number and position it below the heading, to the right.; , Write the word ""Affidavit"" just below the caption, in the center of the page. If your document does not include a case caption, ""Affidavit"" should appear centered at the top of the page.  , These should be left-aligned, with the state appearing above the county.  , This part of the affidavit is called a ""commencement,"" and it's where the full name of the affiant (the person making the statement for the affidavit) should be listed. This part is commonly worded as follows: ""Comes now and states as follows:""If the affidavit is for a court case, the statement should read, ""Comes now , being first duly sworn, under oath, and states as follows:""  , Certain types of affidavits require information about the affiant, other than his or her name. This information appears in the first paragraph, numbered ""1,"" and may include:The address of the affiant. If the address of the affiant is important to the facts described and sworn to, it should be included in the affidavit. For example, when signing an affidavit of residence for the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (""BMV"") so that your child may obtain a driver’s license, you are swearing that your child lives with you within the state. Therefore, your address is important to the facts of the affidavit and should be included. The age or date of birth of the affiant. The age and/or date of birth of the affiant should be included in the affidavit if it is relevant to the subject matter. For example, when circumstances require that the affiant be a certain age, such as when inheriting from a trust fund that requires him or her to have reached the age of 25 to receive the inheritance, then age should be included. The occupation of the affiant. The occupation of the affiant should be included when the affiant is signing as an expert or qualified person. For example, a doctor testifying in a malpractice case as an expert witness or a mechanic certifying the cost of repairs to a car would want to include their occupation. The immigration status of the affiant. When providing an affidavit to support an immigration petition, you should include the affiant’s own immigration status. The relationship of the affiant to the litigant(s). The relationship of the affiant to one or more parties involved in a lawsuit should be included when the affidavit will be used in connection with the suit.  , You may include as many or as few facts in an affidavit as necessary. When describing the facts you should:Use the first person. For example: ""I am the owner of Jane Doe Salon, located in Springfield, Massachusetts."" State each one in a separate paragraph. Each paragraph of the affidavit should include one fact or a small number of facts if one cannot be stated alone. Number your paragraphs. This will make it easier to read and reference in Court or in other documents. Describe each fact clearly and concisely, providing names, dates, addresses, and other supporting information as needed. Use only first-hand information that you can personally verify; do not use speculation or information that you've heard from someone else.Refer to supporting documents, photographs, or other tangible paper items which can be attached to the affidavit, and attach them. For example, if describing a photograph in the affidavit, state that a copy of the photograph is attached and marked as ""Exhibit A"" or “Exhibit 1.” Then write ""Exhibit A"" or “Exhibit 1” on a copy of the photograph and staple it to the completed affidavit. Exhibits may be lettered or numbered and should be labeled according to the order in which they are mentioned in the affidavit.  , Make a clear statement that the affidavit is a complete representation of the facts to which the affiant is swearing. This assures readers that the affidavit is not a partial statement and that it includes all of the information the affiant has on the subject. It is common in the U.S. to end an affiant’s statement with the sentence, ""Further Affiant sayeth not.""  , An affiant in the United States generally writes an affidavit ""under pains and penalties of perjury."" This means that the affiant may be charged with lying under oath if he or she makes any false statement within the affidavit.   Consequently, it is very important to include only information that you know to be true. Never include false information in an affidavit. The consequences could include prosecution and imprisonment., Provide a space for the affiant’s signature, with his or her typed or printed name below, and a space to fill in the date of signing. This will be completed in the presence of a notary.  , The end of the affidavit should include a statement by a court clerk or notary public, or another official authorized to administer an oath. The statement should say that the affiant appeared before the court clerk or notary, swore to the above statements, and showed legal identification. The affidavit must be signed by the affiant in front of the court clerk or notary and include the notary's signature and stamp.   You must bring sufficient identification and show it to the notary in order to establish that you are who you claim to be. For example, you should bring either a valid driver’s license or passport.A minor may sign an affidavit. However, the minor must appear before the notary.If the child does not have an acceptable government-issued ID (such as a passport), then witnesses must appear and give an oath as to the child’s identity. The number of necessary witnesses is decided by state law.","['oath', 'state', 'signature block', 'case caption', 'relevant personal information', 'truth', 'notary signature block', 'affiant', 'county', 'facts', 'statement', 'court clerk', 'list']"
"['monitor the chick in the first days', 'check the babies for fixable developmental problems', 'help the chick wean', 'remove the chick from the nest', 'consult your vet']",How to Care for Your Baby Budgie2," The chick's parents will care for it as best as they can, but you should regularly check on the health and development of the chick. If the chick develops an illness, you may need to consult a veterinarian. By the time the chick is a few days old, it should show some bright colour, and should be beginning to put on weight. Generally a lighter chick is more disposed to illness or is being targeted by red mites.   If your chick doesn't appear to be developing or gaining weight, consider contacting your vet or handfeeding if you can. Once your chick has begun to develop feathers, and they have reached about half an inch long (approximately 1cm), they should feel strong when you touch them., If you think your chick is not developing properly, you should consult a vet for some expert advice, but there are some basic checks that you can do at home to help the chick develop healthily. The first of these is to look under the top mandible (beak). If you notice a build-up of food, this can lead to an undershot beak.   If you see some food stuck there, very carefully remove it with a toothpick. If you think that your chick is beginning to develop splayed legs, try adding some extra bedding to the nest.If the chick cannot stand up straight, perch, or walk around easily, he may have splayed legs. Look to see if the legs lean out to the sides rather than underneath the body.If you are uncertain or you think your chick is ill, don't hesitate to contact your vet.  , Once the chick starts coming out of the nest on his own, you can help the process of weaning along, and then help him leave the nest. Once you notice the chick coming out of the nest, you should provide a shallow dish of food and place it at the bottom of the cage. The chick will start eating the food from the dish, beginning the weaning process.You should allow the chick to wean by itself, but monitor it closely to ensure that it is eating enough.Provide a dish of fresh water so the chick can learn to drink from it. Monitor the chicks and parents; when they have not been fed by the parents for at least a week, have not asked for feeds and you can see they are cracking seeds and filling their crops well you can considered them weaned.  , Once a chick is weaned you can remove him the from the nest. This will help his development and the development of any younger chicks in the nest. Put the weaned chick in a large cage that you have set aside for young birds. Ensure the cage has plenty of food placed in different areas, but especially in a dish at the bottom of the cage, and a supply of fresh water.   Keep a close watch on the young birds and check that they are eating sufficiently. Make sure the bird's crop is full before covering the cage for the night.The crop is the place where budgies store food. When it's full, there is a noticeable lump on the front of the chest., Once your chick is developed and independent, you can book him in for his first check-up with the vet. Bringing him to the vet will reduce the chances of a hidden problem developing. The vet will also be able to give you some good tips on how to care for a young bird. Before you go to the vet, it's a good idea to prepare yourself well.   Write down a list of all the foods and supplements you are feeding your bird. Be able to describe the bird's living environment. Bring in photos if possible.","['babies', 'vet', 'chick', 'nest', 'first days', 'fixable developmental problems']"
"['organize the team movements', 'if you are currently engaging an enemy unit', 'there are a few safer options available:   leapfrogging (one person providing cover fire while the other moves', 'this can be used to advance', 'fall back', 'and flank the enemy)', 'run and gun (providing cover fire for yourself while moving', 'the inverse ""gun and run"" can also be used to move from cover; fire a few bursts then run like hell)', ""and lastly crawling (you don't get far fast but in a prone position you are less likely to get hit if you are 50+ feet away and have shrubs for low cover"", 'do not attempt this in close quarters and this should only be used if the enemy is a big fan of spray and pray', 'as they would likely shoot towards you', 'not at you)', 'deal with combat situations', 'deal with the ambush and creating a superior firing position']",How to Arrange Combat Movement (for Airsoft)," When your team is moving as a group, you can advance in a few different ways:   A loose diamond (one person eyes front, one left, one right, and one checking flanks and 6:00), Staggered columns (the image for this is slightly off, picture the left column a mirror image of the right) (two eyes front, Middle(s) right and left, and rear: flanks and 6:00). Those are for general movement in a non-combat situation.; , when a team is moving while engaging move one person at a time so you can provide cover for each-other.  ,   When you are superior (in this situation steadily advance on the enemy's position but be cautious you can still lose a team member even if you outnumber them, also be ready for an ambush). When the enemy is superior (It is advisable to fall back to a better position, either get to high ground, good cover, or get entrenched and use your skill to take control of the situation if you take out a few of their members even when you are outnumbered the enemy may become demoralized and fall back, that is your opportunity to strike.  Advancing; (when you advance on an enemy make sure to know were their entire unit is, going after one person instead of after a territory can easily lead to an ambush or being flanked and surrounded, even with the upper hand make sure you have a clean exit route in case something comes up) Falling back (when you are out-gunned or become separated from your team you need to fall back to a safer position, don't try to shoot your way out, move fast and low, and stick to cover whenever possible, try to randomize your movement so they can't let you run into their fire, it's always better to fall back with your team then to try to be a hero and hold them off) Flanking (flanking can provide a huge tactical advantage, treat the enemy a a single point that you are going to circle around and entrap, the best way to get behind an enemy position is to have half the team provide heavy fire on their front or provide some other distraction so the rest of the team can get around them and hit their sides or 6.    , Ambushes can take out and entire team if done properly, when ambushing an enemy lure them into a spot by either having a team member be bait (a lonely ill equipped soldier looks like a tempting target) or in a capture the flag scenario have the flag be the bait, the bait should be in a position either in a low point or with no cover so when the enemy arrives they have no cover as well, place your team in a position to flank the enemy and prevent their retreat.   Superior firing positions can be a great advantage, when scouting out an area for a firing position look for waist high cover, high ground, trenches, and have environmental factors on your side, put the sun in their eyes the wind at your back and the rain over their head. since every battleground is different there is no one solution but use your head and try to make it harder for the enemy to hit you than you to hit them.

"['hold the pencil in pre-flip position', 'stiffen your ring finger', 'shooting it backwards', 'get your pointer finger and thumb out of the way', 'bring your middle finger forward once the pencil has started its flip', 'catch it with your thumb', 'keep spinning or end the trick', 'start out slow', 'experiment with different pens and pencils', 'go for the double spin', 'try different spins']",How to Spin a Pencil Around Your Middle Finger," Place the tip on your pointer finger, the midsection resting on the tip of your middle finger, your thumb on top between those two fingers, and the fingernail of your ring finger touching the inside of the pencil. Got it? Cool.   The pencil will feel as if it's dangling by the tips of your fingers, and this is necessary to do the flip. Your hand should be relaxed and loose at this point, too. It'll feel a little precarious, but that's how the pencil's going to get around and around.; , Part of the initial thrust will be from your ring finger as it straightens out, sending the pen around your middle finger. You may find that your pinky finger immediately follows suit, too. Don't mind the pinky – it tends to do its own thing.          This is only part of the entire picture. You can practice this movement, but it won't be perfect until you line up the rest of your fingers and put them to work, too.  , Let's cover them each separately:          The pencil was resting on the pad of your pointer finger. As you go to thrust it around your middle finger, simple extend it outward, taking it off the pencil. You'll need it for the landing, but for the initial thrust, just get it out of the way. Your thumb, on the other hand, should slide down the pencil toward the tip. When it lifts up, this is the release of the tip of the pencil, with your ring finger propelling the base. These two movements are what gets it around your middle finger. Just like your pointer finger, the thumb comes off for the initial flip around and then will be there to catch it in motion.  , Once the thumb releases the tip and the ring finger propels the pencil back, bring your middle finger toward you, bending it ever-so-slightly forward. This allows your pointer finger and thumb to catch it as it comes around.          This is a very small movement. If you move it too much, the pen will just go flying – and your teacher won't be thrilled with you.  , As the pencil rotates around your middle finger and comes around full circle, stop it with your thumb. As the thumb stops it, bring up your pointer finger to catch it from the bottom. And there you have it – that's one entire spin for the record books.         , When you catch the pen as it comes around, return your fingers to the pre-flip position. Then, it's practice, practice, practice.          When the pencil spins all the way around the middle finger, it should land right in the skin between index finger and thumb. At the same time it lands, grip the pencil with any finger and any part of your thumb. The pencil should be able to land in the writing position or something similar to it. This is a good transition to end the trick.  , As you're learning to do this, start out as if you're doing it in slow motion. Guide the pencil around your middle finger as much as you have to – it'll help you see the basics of it. Then, as you get better and better, start speeding up. It just takes practice and time.          You'll notice that when you go slow, you'll have to use your pointer finger to prop it up and get it to your thumb. This is the main difference between going slow and going fast. When you go fast, the pencil has enough power to not need your pointer finger to keep it going. Once you get the hang of it, try doing it without holding the pencil against the thumb flap. This helps for performing the ""Harmonic"" and linking this trick into combos; it disrupts the flow if you must adjust the pencil against your thumb every time you need to perform this trick.  , Sometimes a certain weight or length of pen or pencil just doesn't mesh with your spinning style. If the one you're working with currently is difficult to do, try a different one. You may be surprised that it had more to do with your tool and less to do with you.          Pencils are long and spindly and that can make it difficult for spinning. Imagine if your arms were seven feet long and you had to spin around something, you know? You may want to switch to a pen that's shorter and a little beefier – it may give you something to grab a hold of.  , Once you have the hang of this, try starting the pencil in between your pinky and ring finger. Using the same steps, spin the pencil around your ring finger and catch it between your middle and ring fingers. You will now be set up to spin it around your middle finger – the double spin will give it a cool effect. You can even spin your pencil from the pinky/ring finger to the middle/pointer finger!          Learning how to perform this trick backwards (from index/middle slot to the middle/ring slot) is a good idea too, because you can then perform this trick back-and forth continuously. This is then called the ""Middle Around Harmonic.""  , This spin in particular is good for class. Since it's stopped by your thumb, you don't run the risk of the pen spiraling out of control and landing in your class fish tank. That being said, this may not be the spin for you. Have you ever tried spinning a pencil around your thumb? How about spinning a pencil backwards around your thumb? There's quite a few ways to do it.

You can use plain saline (salt water that matches the salt in tears) or medicated eye drops. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.   Don’t become dependent on eye drops. If you use eye drops frequently, make sure they do not have medication or preservatives in them. Overusing medicated eye drops can actually aggravate eye problems.; , Using a warm compress can help relax the muscles around your eye, which may relieve eye strain and that twitchy feeling tired eyes get. You can use dry or moist warmth, depending on what feels best for you. If you wear glasses or contacts, remove them before using any compress.For a dry compress, fill a clean sock with uncooked rice or beans and knot the sock to keep it closed. Microwave the sock for about 30 seconds, or until it’s warm but not too hot. Apply the compress to your eye. For a moist compress, wet a clean washcloth or several paper towels with warm (almost, but not quite, hot) water. Lay the cloth across your eyes. You can apply gentle pressure with your palm if you want, but don’t press too hard. Leave the compress on until it cools.  , Using your palms to apply gentle pressure to your eye area can help reduce eye strain and relieve pain. If you wear them, remove your glasses or contacts before using your palms as a compress.   Cross your hands with your palms facing you. Gently press the palms of your hands against your eyes. Continue for 30 seconds, then relax. Repeat as often as necessary to reduce soreness.  , Some herbs, such as chamomile, goldenseal, eyebright, calendula, and Oregon grape/barberry, have anti-inflammatory properties that may help soothe your eyes.While there is no scientific evidence to suggest that a tea bag is more effective than another warm compress, you may find the herbal aroma relaxing.Place two tea bags in a mug and pour boiling water over them. Allow the tea to steep for about five minutes, or until the water is still warm but not hot. Squeeze excess liquid from the tea bags and place one over each eye. Lean your head back and relax. Once the tea bags have cooled, remove them. You can repeat this as often as you want. If you can’t find tea bags, you can cut the toes off a nylon knee-high stocking, pour the dried herb into the toe, tie it off, and use it as a tea bag.  , It’s every teenager’s favorite weapon, but the eye-roll can also help relieve eye strain. Close your eyes and focus on breathing deeply while you perform the following motions:   Roll your eyes clockwise. Then roll them counter-clockwise. This full movement is one complete eye-roll. Repeat the eye-roll 20 times. Start off slowly and get a bit faster each time. Do this 2-4 times a day to help relieve and prevent eye strain.  ,   Try to stand up, move around, and shake yourself out every hour or so. This will help refresh you and keep your eyes from getting strained in the first place.  , Anxiety, stress, and muscle tension can cause eye strain and soreness. Take a few deep breaths, shake out your limbs, and roll your head around. Get up and take a quick walk. Do some stretches. You can also use progressive muscle relaxation on your eyes to help relieve soreness and strain.Find a quiet, comfortable place away from distractions, if possible. Breathe deeply and evenly. Clench your eyelids as tightly as possible. Hold this tension for ten seconds, then relax. Open your eyes. Raise your eyebrows as far as you can.

"['decide what kind of notebook you want to buy', 'get a folder for each class', 'buy your other school supplies', 'keep your personal area clean and organized', 'keep track of assignments and due dates', 'bring the correct supplies to school and home', ""don't procrastinate on assignments"", 'have a designated space to do your homework', 'make up any missed time']",How to Get Organized for School2," This is a very important decision. Some people prefer spiral notebooks, as it will keep all of your notes in one place, while others prefer a three-ring binder that they can open and close. The choice is up to you and should be based on which one you think will keep you most organized.   A three-ring binder has the benefit that you can open it, put paper in, and take your paper out. This can be helpful if your teacher asks to see your work. However, it can take up a lot of room if you buy a big one.Organize your three-ring binder if you buy one. Get tab dividers and create a tab for each one of your classes: science, math, social studies, reading, writing, and any other classes you attend. This way, you will have your notes and work from each class in a separate place.  , In each class, you may get a lot of ""hand-outs,"" or xeroxed papers. You need to keep these papers organized. If you get a folder for each class, and label each folder with the class name, then you can easily keep your loose papers organized.Bring the folders with you to class. If you get a handout, put it into the folder immediately after you are done looking at it in class. If you scared of the papers falling out of a folder, pocket files that close completely are a nice substitute. Clean out your folders once a week. Take out old handouts and make room for new handouts. Some spiral notebooks come with pockets between sections. These can function well for keeping loose papers organized. If you have a spiral notebook with pockets, be sure to use a specific pocket for each class, and don't just stash your handouts in a random pocket.  , These may include: pencils, pens, a ruler, and paper, among many other things. You may also need to get a new backpack or school bag at the beginning of the school year.If you have separate classes with separate teachers, you may be able to use some of the same supplies for several classes. Look at the supply lists given to you by all of your teachers and compare what each requires. If there is overlap in general supplies, such as pencils, then you can probably use them for multiple classes. If a teacher says you will need a certain supply for their class, get it. Having the right supplies will help you to succeed in a given class.  , If you have a locker, make sure all of its contents are neatly organized. This way you can easily find the folders and textbooks that you need when you need them.   You may need to share a locker with another student. They may not be as tidy as you are, so you will need to negotiate with them about what space is yours and what space is theirs, so that you can keep your section neat at least. To keep your locker organized, decide where all of your stuff should ideally go. There should be a shelf for books, a hook for your jacket and bag, and an area for other items you need, such as a spare brush or gym clothes. If you have planned out where things go, its easier to keep your stuff organized. If you have a hard time keeping your area clean on a day-to-day basis, then pick a day each week to spend a few minutes cleaning up your space. Put things in their right place and clean out garbage and items that need to go home. Friday is a great day to do this, so that you can start Monday morning with a clean start.  , This is a very important part of being organized for class. In order to be successful in class, you need to know when to start an assignment and when it needs to be turned in. There are few feelings that are worse than going into class and realizing that you forgot to do an assignment that is due.This is most easily done by using a planner, either on paper or electronically. At the beginning of the term, write the important due dates into your planner. That way, for any given day or week, you will know what to get done. Write down due dates right when you find them out. This includes when a teacher changes the due date of an assignment they have already assigned. This will help you avoid forgetting about an important date. However, this requires you to keep your calendar with you every day at school, so that you can keep it up to date. Try color coding your assignments in your planner so that you know which assignments are for which class. Pick a different color of highlighter for each class so that you can see what assignments are for each of your classes.  , If you are organized enough to know what is due, you should be able to figure out what supplies you need to complete those assignments. This includes both what you need to bring home to do your homework and what you need to have in class so that you can complete assignments there.   When you write due dates in your planner, try adding a short list of what you will need to have at home to finish that assignment. This will make having the right supplies easier. Your teacher will tell you what to bring to class. This may change from day to day or it may be the same for every class period. Bringing heavy textbooks home can be a hassle. What is more of a hassle, however, is not having what you need to finish your assignment on time.  , Organizing your time is an important part of being organized for school. This means getting your assignments done when you are supposed to, instead of late or not at all.   If you have a daily or weekly planner, set aside time to do your assignments. This is especially important for more long term projects, as they will take more time and cannot be easily done at the very last moment.Make sure that you do your homework as soon as you get home. Otherwise you are bound to get distracted or talk yourself out of it.  , When you sit there, don't do anything else. Just focus on the homework or projects you need to do. Keeping the space solely for your school work will help you to focus on your work when you are supposed to.   When you do your homework, make sure you do it in a quiet place with little distractions. It's best to avoid working where people are talking loudly, in front of the TV, or in any other noisy area. Stock your homework area with pens, pencils, erasers, and anything else you will need on hand when doing your homework., If you are ever absent, make sure you get notes from a friend before the next class. If there is anything you don't understand, go and ask the friend you borrowed the notes from or the teacher. This requires some effort on your part but will help you to continue to be successful in class.   Staying organized while making up for lost class time will help you in the long run. The information you missed in class will probably appear in quizzes and tests, so if you follow up and get the information you can still succeed.

Stir the ingredients until they're combined and then set the bowl aside. For the dry ingredients, you'll need:2 1/2 cups (312 g) all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon table salt; , Get out a small bowl and crack one egg into it. Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon of white vinegar, and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water. Whisk the wet ingredients until the egg is completely blended into the liquids.If you'd prefer, you could use schmaltz instead of vegetable oil.  , Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir the mixtures together. Put the dough onto a work surface and knead it until it forms a rough ball.You'll need to work the dough for about a minute so it comes together.  , Transfer the knish dough back to the mixing bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Put the dough aside for one hour to rest while you make one of the fillings.If you'd like to make the dough in advance, chill the dough in the fridge. You can prepare it up to three days before you want to make the knishes.  , Wash 1 1/2 pounds (680 g) of Russet potatoes. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the potatoes. Take a sharp knife and carefully cut each potato into four pieces. Put the pieces of potato into a large pot., Pour enough cold water over the potatoes in the pot to completely cover them. Turn the heat on to high so the water comes to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium and cook the potatoes for about 20 minutes. Drain the cooked potatoes and put the potatoes into a large mixing bowl. Let the potatoes cool.To see if the potatoes are done cooking, poke one of them with a fork. If you can insert and remove the fork easily, the potatoes are done.  , Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable or olive oil and 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Peel and dice 1 small yellow onion. Add the onion to the hot pan and turn the heat to medium-low. Stir and cook the onion until it's dark golden brown and softened.You can saute the onion for 20 to 30 minutes to get a deep caramelized flavor.  , Scoop the caramelized onion into the mixing bowl with the potatoes. Mash the mixture until it's almost smooth. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon table salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Set the filling aside while you roll out the knish dough., Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Peel and dice enough shallots to get 1 1/2 cups (150 g) of diced shallots. Add them to the pan and stir them. Stir and saute the shallots for a few minutes and then remove them from heat.The shallots should soften and become translucent. Keep an eye on them since shallots can burn quickly.  , Place a few layers of cheesecloth into a fine mesh strainer. Set the strainer over a sink. Put 2 cups (450 g) of cottage cheese into the cheesecloth and let it drain for 30 minutes to 1 hour. You don't need to save the liquid that drains out of the cottage cheese. Transfer the drained cottage cheese to a mixing bowl.If you don't have cheesecloth, you can line the strainer with large coffee filters.  , Scoop the sauteed shallots into the bowl with the drained cottage cheese. Add the remaining filling ingredients and stir the filling mixture until it's combined. You'll need:1 egg 1 teaspoon low sodium salt 1/8 teaspoon ground pepper 2 tablespoons low-fat crème fraîche  , Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). This will ensure that the oven is ready to use once you've rolled and filled the knishes. Get out a large baking sheet and lay a sheet of parchment paper over it. Set the sheet aside while you roll the dough., Remove the plastic wrap from the bowl with the dough and place the dough on your work surface. Cut the dough in half to get two equal pieces. Set one piece aside. Sprinkle your work surface with some flour and put the other piece of dough on it. Roll the dough into a thin square that's about 12 inches (30 cm) in size. You'll need to roll the other piece of dough into a square too.Sprinkle more flour on your work surface if the dough begins to stick.  , Take your filling and divide it into two portions (one for each square of dough). Shape one portion of filling into a 2-inch (5 cm) long and place it across the bottom of the dough. Fold the dough over the filling and roll it up to the end. Roll and fill the other portion of dough and filling.Avoid rolling the dough too tightly or it may split as it bakes. If you'd like to make two different kinds of knishes, make a half batch of each type of filling. Use one filling on each of the squares of dough.  , Use a knife or bench scraper to trim off the ends of each log of filled dough. These ends are the parts that don't contain any of the fillings. Use your finger to press indentations on the log at 3 inches (7.5 cm) and 6 inches (15 cm) across. Twist the dough at these points.Twisting the dough will seal off individual knishes (kind of like how sausage links are strung together).  , Cut the dough at the twisted points so you end up with 3 segments for each log. Pinch the ends of one segment together to make a sealed bottom of one knish. Press the knish with the palm of your hand to flatten it a little. If you want, you can pinch the top ends like you did on the bottom or you can loosely fold them over the dough so they're slightly open.If you're using different fillings for half of your knishes, consider sealing the tops differently so you can tell them apart.  , Get out the baking sheet that you lined with parchment paper. Set the six knishes on the paper and ensure that they aren't touching one another.If your knishes are large and your baking pan is small, consider using two small baking sheets.  , Whisk the egg yolk and water together until they're combined. Dip a pastry brush into the egg wash and brush it over the knishes on the baking sheet.The egg wash will make the knishes turn golden brown as they bake. It will also make them slightly glossy.  , Put the knishes in the preheated oven and bake them for 45 minutes. Check the knishes halfway through baking to ensure that they're baking evenly. If one side of the pan is browning faster, you may need to turn the tray so they bake evenly. Serve the knishes once they're warm enough to handle.Knishes are best served the same day you bake them, but you can freeze them unbaked. Put unbaked knishes into an airtight container and freeze them until you're ready to pop them in the oven. You don't need to defrost them before baking the knishes.

Improper usage or maintenance of your furnace could result in the furnace not functioning, fires, explosions, property damage, personal injury, or death.Some furnaces may no longer have attached instructions or these may be difficult to read due to label dirtiness or deterioration. Your furnace user manual should include a copy of all instructions. If you’ve misplaced your manual, look it up online with a keyword search for the furnace make and model number. Because there are many different furnace designs, a diagram can be useful when locating various parts. Furnace diagrams are generally found in the user manual.; , Smell the area around your furnace, including low to the floor. Some gas may be heavier than air and sink to the floor, escaping immediate notice. There should be no leaks or water on or around the furnace. Water can cause dangerous shorts in your furnace electrical components.  If you detect gas, do not turn on any appliances, light switches, or phones. Evacuate the building completely and contact your gas company from outside or next door for further instruction. If there are leaks, turn off electricity to your furnace. Repair leaking pipes and dry the area completely before returning power to the furnace. If any furnace electrical components were submerged in water, do not turn the furnace on. Call a furnace technician to inspect your furnace and replace ruined parts., If your furnace has been off for the warm months, you may need to restore power to the furnace at your home electrical panel or fuse box. These are usually found in your basement, utility room, or garage. The furnace fuse or breaker should be in the “On” position., The front access panel is often held in place with screws. Unfasten these, if necessary, with a screwdriver or suitable tool. Set the panel off to the side. Keep the screws in a location they won’t be lost, like in a plastic baggie.Taking off the access panel should give you an improved view of the pilot light. Additionally, some controls, like the gas supply, may be located behind this panel.  , A description of the ideal flame for your pilot should included in your manual. Generally, the flame should not be excessively yellow, it should not be split into two or more flames, and it should not flicker or waver., Most pilot lights can be adjusted by turning a screw on the body of the pilot valve. Reach into the access panel and insert a suitable screwdriver into the slot of the pilot screw. Turn it counterclockwise to intensify the flame and clockwise to diminish it.  Verify the pilot adjustment screw in the furnace manual before adjusting it. Turning the incorrect screw could dangerously impact the performance of your pilot. Depending on your furnace, the ideal pilot light may differ slightly. Most home models will have a full and steady flame that is between 1½ and 2 in (3.8 and 5 cm) tall.After adjusting your pilot light, if its condition remains questionable, you be able to resolve the problem by turning off power and gas to the furnace and relighting the pilot.  , Turn the power switch of the furnace to “Off.” The gas supply can usually be found along the furnace bottom, on its control panel, or inside the access panel. Turn the gas supply to “Off” and wait at least five minutes.  Failing to wait at least five minutes could result in the gas not fully dissipating, which can cause fires when relighting the pilot. While waiting for gas to dissipate, locate the “Reset” button for your furnace. This is usually found near the gas supply controls., Hold a long stem lighter in your hand. With your free hand, set your gas supply to “Pilot.” Light the lighter. Press in and hold the “Reset” button. Bring the flame of the lighter to the opening of the pilot light. When lit, remove the lighter and release the “Reset” button. Turn the gas supply to “On.”  Substitute long stem lighter for a long stem match. In a pinch, roll paper into a thin tube and light one end on fire. Use this as you would a match. In some cases, you may need to repeat the pilot lighting procedure more than once. The flame should be thick and steady, with a height of roughly 1½ to 2 in (3.8 to 5 cm).If your pilot does not stay lit after 3 tries or does not burn as intended, turn off power and gas to the furnace and consult a furnace technician., If your furnace instructions indicate it has an auto igniter, do not attempt to light the pilot by hand. Different models of auto ignition furnace may have different procedures for lighting. For this reason, follow the manual instructions to use this feature.  Generally, furnaces with auto igniters must be turned off and purged of gas as usual. Access panels are then replaced and power restored to the furnace before a special thermostat setting or button, like one labeled ""Call for Heat,"" is used to start the pilot., Fit the panel back in place on the furnace. Use your screwdriver or a suitable tool to refasten the panel in place. Access panels and door covers that aren’t properly reattached may prevent your furnace from starting., The “On” switch for most furnaces is usually placed at eye level or a little higher. This switch is frequently installed around the bottom of basement stairs, but it may also be found the furnace room. Set this switch to the “On” position., The thermostat of your furnace should now have power. Select the “Heat” setting on the thermostat, then set the temperature to your preference. When the temperature drops below the thermostat setting, the furnace will turn on and heat your home.If you have a furnace with an auto ignition feature, usually this is the point you would trigger the igniter with a special thermostat setting or button, sometimes labeled ""Call for Heat."" Once lit, set your furnace to ""Heat."", Dirty filters are a common problem that often prevent your furnace from starting.Buy a new filter at your local hardware store. Turn off the furnace and remove the filter service panel. Pull out the used filter from its slot and replace it with the new filter. Turn on the furnace.  Some furnaces may have a special procedure for replacing filters. Always follow your furnace instructions for the best results. Most basic filters, like those made of fiberglass or paper, should be changed every month or two. Electrostatic and HEPA filters only need to be changed every two to four months. If you have pets, you may need to replace your filter more frequently for it to operate most efficiently., Make sure the thermostat is working by adjusting its temperature setting by 5° increments until the furnace turns on. Double check that the “Heat” setting is selected on the thermostat.If your thermostat is not working, consult your manual for troubleshooting or replacement options.  , Many furnaces will not start if access doors or covers are not correctly reattached. Too many closed heat registers can also create problems. At most, only 20% of your registers should be closed.  In a home with 10 heat registers, for example, you should only close 2 registers at most. Closing registers in unused rooms can cut down heating costs., If your furnace does not turn on even when power is supplied to it from the electrical panel or fuse box, you may have a blown fuse. Check the main electrical panel or fuse box of your home and any furnace fuses. Reset or replace blown fuses.  The layout of your furnace will vary depending on your make and model. To quickly locate fuses for your furnace, consult the manual instructions. Furnace fuses are often found behind an electrical panel close to the main access panel. These fuses may also be positioned inside or on top of the unit. Blown furnace fuses are a somewhat rare occurrence. Replacement furnace fuses can be purchased at your local hardware store.","['water', 'dirty furnace filters', 'area', 'pilot', 'long stem', 'unlit pilots', 'light non-auto igniter pilots', 'purge gas', 'doors', 'access panel', 'condition', 'pilot light', 'furnace activation', 'pilots', 'supply power', 'thermostat', 'furnace instructions', 'front furnace access panel', 'circuit breakers', 'auto igniter', 'flame', 'gas', 'furnace', 'thermostat settings']"
"['decide on placement', 'choose a design for the tattoo', 'find a tattoo shop and artist', 'test out a design before you get it permanently', 'consider career limitations']",How to Get a Tattoo on Your Fingers1," Determine where on the fingers and on which finger you’d like to place a tattoo, as you have several options.   Knuckle tattoos are generally placed between either the first and second or second and third knuckles of any finger, on the flat back surface. Lettering across multiple “knuckles” is commonly suited to this placement, which is more likely to hold ink well than anywhere else on the finger, given that it is less often in contact with other fingers. Tattoos can be placed on the side of any finger, as in where two fingers might touch when together. Small images and even words are commonly inked here. Ring tattoos mimic the band of a metal ring by going all the way around a finger. Note that this and any other finger tattoo that has ink on the inside of the hand can more easily blur and fade because it is frequently exposed to movement, sweat, sun, and washing.; , Come to a sure decision about the design of your tattoo and whether it will be in color or black and white.   Consider popular designs for finger tattoos, which include simple lettering, symbols, and sentimental or marital themed pieces for a creative alternative to traditional rings and wedding bands. Avoid very intricate, detailed, or precise designs, as a finger affords very little space for tattoo art, and the ink may not hold color and detail as well as other areas due to the nature of the skin.With any tattoo, it’s a good idea to visit a tattoo artist in your process of deciding on a design, whether you are familiar with their art and want to leave more creative control to them, or you want to see how they’ll interpret a very specific design that you want.  , If you are getting a permanent tattoo done, do your research into any tattoo parlor you’re interested in, as well as the specific artist who will work on you.   Note that there are some tattoo shops and artists who will not perform finger tattoos as a general rule, usually because they believe ink does not take as well to the skin on the fingers. Definitely be sure to check with the shop about their policies ahead of time. Examine the shop itself for cleanliness and proper disposal methods, as well as looking into the license and certifications of any artist. Be willing to pay more for a quality shop or an artist with more experience.If you are opting for a henna tattoo or other temporary method, search for shops that apply henna or buy your own online or in stores.  , Get used to having a finger tattoo design by creating a temporary one and continuing to redo it to determine if you still like it over time.   Get a henna tattoo with your design for something that will last for up to a couple weeks. You can have the tattoo redone or do it yourself to test it out for an even longer period. Try a premade temporary tattoo from any store, or make your own using Sharpies or pens, eyeliner, or nail polish. Reapply as it wears off to test the tattoo for a longer period of time.  , Remember that many job industries and those hiring you may prohibit visible tattoos, or visible tattoos may hurt your chances at a job. Consider this before getting a permanent finger tattoo, as they are nearly impossible to cover or hide.   Those in the medical industry, law, corporate offices, etc. are more likely to have restrictions on visible tattoos like finger tattoos. Retail, service, creative, and physical labor industries are more likely to be accepting of body ink. Keep in mind that even if there are no written restrictions in your current industry or one you plan to pursue a job in, any unexpected job interview in the future may be negatively impacted by tattoos. About 60 percent of human resource managers surveyed in 2012 said a tattoo could hinder the chance of getting hired.","['career limitations', 'artist', 'tattoo shop', 'placement', 'design', 'tattoo']"
"['try whitening strips', 'think about whitening gels', 'look at whitening trays', 'consider whitening toothpastes', 'find a dental school']",How to Get Low Cost Tooth Whitening1," Like other over-the-counter treatments, you can buy whitening strips from the store. As their name implies, they are strips that fit over your teeth.To use, you cover the front of your teeth with the strips and then leave them on for 30 minutes. You must do this every day for about two weeks. Make sure that you brush your teeth before you use the whitening strips. This will provide better strip-to-tooth contact, which should improve your results. You'll need to do this treatment about three times a year. While this option is one of the more expensive ones for over-the-counter treatments, it is somewhat more effective than other over-the-counter treatments.; , Another option is paint-on gels. Basically, you apply the gel to your teeth with a small brush. You also have to leave this gel on for about 30 minutes.Some of these types of whiteners are simply a pen filled with the gel that has a brush on one end.Usually, you apply the whitener once or twice a day, with about the same effectiveness as strips. It can be applied to just one or two teeth, if you need it. Also, one disadvantage is it can come off pretty easily after you've brushed it on. The gel is usually not strong enough to cause tooth sensitivity, but it is still important to avoid placing the gel on your gums to avoid causing any burns.  , With whitening trays, you place a whitening agent in a tray, and then you put that on your teeth. You leave these on for a period of time, then take them off.This method can be more effective than strips or brush-on gel.The best kind are the ones that you mold to your teeth at home. Some are not designed to be molded to your teeth and therefore, are harder to keep on.However, trays that your dentist make will be more effective, as they will be made to fit your teeth allowing the gel to spread equally over your teeth and stay coat the entire tooth surface., Whitening toothpastes may not be as effective as other options. However, they can provide some results, and they are by far one of the cheapest options.Whitening toothpastes can use special abrasive material as well as chemicals to whiten your teeth. Toothpastes do not contain peroxide, like some other whitening options do. Use a whitening toothpaste to replace a normal toothpaste. Use twice a day, and you may see results in a month to a month and a half. However, look for a brand that's approved by the American Dental Association, as others can damage your teeth over time due to the abrasive ingredients used to remove stains.Toothpastes with blue covarine may show results more quickly. You can also follow with a whitening mouthwash., One way you may be able to get professional whitening for less is at a dental school. As dentists are learning, they need to practice their skills. Because they are practicing, services will be at a discounted rate to you.Check with your local colleges and universities to see if there is a dental school nearby. All student dentists will be under the supervision of professionals, so you will be in good hands.

"['understand how to create\xa0passion', 'think about things that you feel passionately about', 'understand why these things make you feel passionate', 'make happy moments and happy memories', 'understand what your answers mean', 'use happiness to create passion']",How to Re Ignite Passion in a Marriage," Passion is a phenomenon that is created. It is not a spontaneous thing that just happens. In order to understand how to create passion, you must do two things. First, you need to understand why you feel passion. Then you need to understand how passion is created.; , Do you have a job that you love? Is there a hobby you can't live without? Maybe you have a talent you live for.   Regardless of what it is, there are many different things in life that can make you feel passionately. It could be a wonderful career, or your brand new sports car, a young puppy, playing video games, painting pottery, dancing, pretending you're a superstar when it's karaoke night at the bar, etc. The list is endless. Take a moment and try to identify the things you have in your life that make you feel passion.  , Now that you have identified what it is that makes you feel this way, think about why it is that these things make you feel passionate. Why are you passionate about your job/hobby/talent/pet?   One thing you will notice about anything that makes you feel passionate is that this is something that makes you feel happy. Feeling passionate is a good feeling. Passions are often developed from feelings of love and happiness. It is the love and happiness we feel for these things that grows into a passion over time. Therefore, with time, it is possible for passion to become stronger. Never give up hope when the passion in your marriage is dwindling. Remain hopeful that you will feel passionately with your partner again, starting with learning how to make each other happy.  , Learn how to make your partner happy and teach your partner how to make you happy. Any true passion thrives off of happiness. You need to take the time to understand your partner's wants and needs. Sometimes we can even be unaware of what our wants and needs are, so doing this can take a great deal of effort.   If you are having trouble figuring out what your own wants and needs are, then start by being honest with yourself. You can ask yourself and/or your partner the following questions to help you learn what your wants and needs are:  What do I want from my partner? What do I need from my partner to make me happy? What is making me feel sad and/or angry in my relationship? What do I need to change in my life to create my own happiness?    , The first two questions will help you identify what you need and desire from a romantic relationship to feel fulfilled by it. The last two questions will help you learn how you can work towards making your relationship more satisfying to you.   After you answer the third question, take your answers and write down the opposite for each one. For example, if your partner's distance and lack of affection makes you feel sad, then for the opposite, you should write that closeness and affection from your partner makes you feel happy. Completing this exercise will help you identify exactly what will make you feel happier in your relationship with your partner. It will also help you identify what you want and need from them.  , Now that you understand more about how passion is created, try to use the things that make you happy and your partner happy to create it. Sometimes this means willing to compromise or make sacrifices. Always remember that you and your partner are two different people, who each feel passionately about different things.   Understanding how your partner is different from you and willing to accept this is a huge step. So for starters, don't be afraid to go out of your way to make your partner happy. Do something special just for him or her. It doesn't have to be something big.  You can start with the little things. If she loves chicken alfredo, take her to her favorite Italian restaurant. If he loves epic movies, go with him to the theater to see Lord of the Rings. Maybe she would appreciate it more if you helped her clean up around the house. Get out the dish soap and help her clean up after she makes dinner. Maybe he just wants to have his space and some free time to himself. Give it to him, and do something that makes you happy when you're not with him. Here's the trick, though: Don't just do it, actually enjoy doing it. Remember, this is something you're doing for your partner because it makes them feel good! If you act resentful or annoyed about doing something to try to make your partner happy, your partner is not going to be very happy about it. When you do something out of frustration and anger, even it is to make someone else feel good, then the person on the receiving end just feels like they are the recipient of your incurred wrath. Passion is not created out of wrath. It is created from happiness. If your partner needs you to do something you resent doing to be happy, like the dirty dishes in hell's kitchen, then just remember, you are doing this because you love, admire, appreciate, and respect your partner. Even if you can't feel happy about doing it, at least do it with a feeling of mutual respect.    ","['happy moments', 'things', 'answers', 'passion', 'happy memories', 'use happiness']"
"['be careful', 'look at the big picture', 'take time to establish rapport with the alleged liar and create a relaxed atmosphere', 'establish a baseline', 'learn to spot deflections', 'ask the person to repeat the story over again', 'stare at the alleged liar with a look of disbelief', 'use silence', 'follow through']",How to Detect Lies4," Although it is possible to detect dishonesty and lying, it is also possible to misread deception where there is none. A range of factors could be causing a person to appear as if he or she is lying when the ""signs"" might be due to embarrassment, shyness, awkwardness or a sense of shame/inferiority. A stressed person can be easily mistaken for a liar, as some of the manifestations of stress mimic the indicators of lying indicators. For this reason, it is important that any observation of a person suspected of lying involves drawing together a ""cluster"" of deceptive behaviors and responses, as there is no single ""aha!"" sign., When assessing the body language, verbal responses and other indicators indicative of lying, consider factors such as:Is the person unduly stressed in general, not just from the situation in which he or she is in now? Is there a cultural factor involved? Perhaps the behavior is culturally appropriate in one culture but is seen as dishonest behavior in another. Are you personally biased or prejudiced against this person? Do you want this person to be lying? Be careful of falling into this trap! Is there a history of this person lying? Namely, is he or she experienced at it? Is there a motive and do you have a good reason for suspecting lying? Are you actually any good at reading lies? Have you taken into account the entire context and not simply zoomed in on one or two possible indicators?  , This includes not showing any signs that you suspect the other person of lying and making an effort to mirror his or her body language and pace of conversation. When questioning the person, act in an understanding, not overbearing, manner. This approach will help to let down the other person's guard and can help you to read the signs more clearly.  , A baseline is how someone behaves when he or she is not lying. This will help you tell if the way the person is acting currently is any different from how they usually act. Begin by getting to know the person if you don't already and proceed from there — people usually answer basic questions about themselves truthfully. For someone you already know, checking for a baseline might include asking the person about something the answer of which you already know.  , Usually, when people are lying, they will tell stories that are true, but are deliberately aimed at not answering the question you asked. If a person responds to the question ""Did you ever hit your wife?"" with an answer such as ""I love my wife, why would I do that?"" the suspect is technically telling a truth, but is avoiding answering your original question. This may indicate that he or she is lying or trying to conceal something from you.  , If you're really not sure whether they're telling the truth, ask them to repeat the story multiple times. It's hard to keep track of information that isn't truthful. In the process of repeating their made-up story, the liar is likely to say something inconsistent, outright false, or telling.   Ask the person to tell the story backwards.This is very hard to do, especially when requiring no loss of the details. Even a professional liar can find this reversal of approach a hard one to tackle effectively.  , If the person is lying, he or she will soon become uncomfortable. If the person is telling the truth, he or she will often become angry or just frustrated (lips pressed together, brows down, upper eyelid tensed and pulled down to glare).  , It's very hard for a liar to avoid filling silence created by you.He or she wants you to believe the lies being woven; silence gives no feedback on whether or not you've bought the story. By being patient and remaining silent, many deceitful people will keep talking to fill that silence, embellishing and possibly slipping up in the process, without even being asked anything!   Liars try to read you to see if you've bought the tale.If you don't show any signs of something to monitor, many liars will feel uncomfortable. If you're a good listener, you'll already be avoiding interruptions, which in itself is a great technique to let the story unfold. Practice not interrupting others if you have this tendency — not only will it help you to detect lies, but it'll make you a better listener generally.  , If you have the means, check out the facts behind what the liar is saying. A skilled liar might give some reason why you shouldn't talk to the person who could confirm or deny a story. These are probably lies themselves, so it might be worthwhile overcoming your reluctance and to check with the person you've been warned against. Anything factual that can be checked should be checked.

Some toy shops even sell elastic circular ropes that are meant for playing Chinese jump rope.   You can also use a 9 to 12 foot (2.7 to 3.7 m) long elastic band. Just tie the ends together to form a circle.; , You will need at least three people to play Chinese jump rope, but you can play with more than three as well. Two of the players will be the rope holders and one (or more) will be the jumpers., The rope will need to be stretched out so that it looks like a long, skinny rectangle. Make sure that you have enough space to play. You should have several feet on each side so that jumpers can run in and out of the ropes.  , The holders should step into the ends of the rope so that they are facing each other. They should stand with their feet about shoulder-width apart and inch back a bit until the rope is taut.There should be enough space for a third player to safely jump between the first two players. If there isn’t enough room, then you need a longer rope!  , Chinese jump rope patterns can be made up of basic moves in any combination or order you want. The basic moves include:In: The jumper’s feet land inside the rope. Out: The jumper’s feet land on one side of the rope. Right: The jumper’s right foot lands inside the rope. Left: The jumper’s left foot lands inside the rope. On: The jumper’s feet land on the rope. Turn: The jumper spins in mid-air to face the opposite direction. Straddle: The jumper’s feet land on either side of the rope.  , To play Chinese jump rope, you will need to come up with a pattern for the holders to call out as the jumper jumps. You can make the pattern as short or as long as you want, but keep in mind that the longer the pattern, the more difficult it will be. The pattern can be something simple or more advanced. Some sample patterns include:  In-Out-In-Out-On Out-On-Right-In-Out-On-Left-In In-Straddle-Turn-Right-Out  , When you have decided on the pattern to use, the holders and jumper can all chant it together while the jumper jumps. If the jumper does all of the moves successfully, then you can speed it up or try a harder pattern. If the jumper messes up, then someone else can have a turn.  , If the jumper completes the pattern without touching the rope, you can also raise it a little higher. Then, the jumper must complete the same pattern at this new height. Keep raising the rope until the jumper touches it or makes a mistake.Start out with the rope around the holders' ankles, then move it up to their knees, and then move it up to their waists.  , You can make Chinese jump rope harder by having the holders take one foot out of the rope so that the inner rope area is not as wide. This will make it harder for the jumper to get both feet into the rope., The next jumper should try to repeat the first jumper’s skip pattern. Once everyone has had a turn, move on to a different pattern. Try coming up with longer and more complicated jump patterns as the game goes on!  , If you’d like, pay attention to how high each jumper successfully completes the pattern. For each round, award two points to the highest jumper, one point to the middle jumper, and zero points to the lowest jumper. Tally up the points at the end to see who won!

The higher-quality earbuds, like from Sennheiser or Ultimate Ears, usually come with little cases to put your earbuds in when you're not using them, so they won't get ruined or dirty at the bottom of your bag. If you keep a very small purse and want to keep your iPod Nano and earbuds together in it, or you're a guy with limited pocket space, earbuds are probably a better choice. They're also great if you are on a limited budget, because there's a lot more to choose from and they tend to cost less.  Cheaper earbuds often run into problems like falling out of ears, hurting ears, or simply making dents in them from the cheap plastic. With higher prices (but still low-end in terms of quality) ranging from $25-50, you'll get more comfortable 'buds, and they are well-worth the money you spend. However, if you're an audiophile, you should consider other options. A pair of buds from Sennheiser (like the CX 500, $130), Shure (SE 115, $120), EtyMotic Research (HF5, $150), Sony (XBA-H1, $150), or even Ultimate Ears (minimum Super.fi 4) will be preferable.   Headphones are great if you enjoy putting them around your neck while you're walking from one place to another, or if you just carry your headphones that way. You also tend to get beefier cords and fun options like wireless/bluetooth headphones. The drawback is that good headphones within your budget might be hard to find. They take up more space than earbuds, and the DJ-style headphones take up a ridiculous amount of space if you don't carry around a larger bag.  DJ-style headphones are just that. Huge, bulky, awesome-looking headphones that are reminiscent of what you'd see someone named Double D mix his jams with. The structure lends itself to good sound containment but bad size usage. And a lot of music buffs get them because of the better sound quality and less pressure exuded on the eardrum, resulting in longer listening time and less damage to the eardrum. Behind-the-neck headphones are exactly that as well, headphones with a connecting band that goes behind the neck instead of over the top of the head. This is recommended for joggers or people who wear hats a lot and also for sunglasses fanatics. Therefore, if you're a girl (or guy) with long hair, and you hate headphones that press your hair down or dislike headphones that irritate your ear piercings, this type would be a good choice. Besides that, there are very few things that separate them from DJ-style or ""regular"" headphones.  ; , Generally, more expensive headphones are made with higher quality materials and better engineering, improving the sound quality. $30 headphones will sound good, but not as good as $60 ones. Up in the $80-90 range, you may hear stuff in your music that you've never heard before. $9.99 bargain bin earbuds or headphones may last, at longest, a year, and will not sound great to begin with. So spending at least $20 on them insures you at least get basic music quality. One guideline is to spend $50 on portable headphones and $250 on a pair for a home stereo. Another thing you get with quality is durability. There are probably people out there with headphones from the 70's and 80's that still work because they're made well, and made to last. When you get a brand name you aren't just paying for the name sometimes; you're paying for the trusted quality.  , This refers to how well they keep music in and block outside noise. Nothing is more annoying than having to turn up your volume to drown out the sound of the bus. There's also the fact that if you're rather deaf, enjoy turning your music up loud, and/or use it to drown out background noise and the headphones are very open, you'll end up giving everyone around you something to gossip about. Sound isolation will also keep you from having to waste precious battery life or turn up the volume to hear properly.   Earbuds and in-ear headphones tend to be better at sound isolation, due to the seal they provide in your ear; and the same with (huge) DJ-style headphones that create a little sealed environment around the ear. When buying over-the-ear stereo headphones, notice if they are open-backed or closed-backed. Open headphones tend to sound more natural and not distorted, but people will hear your music and you'll hear the environment around you. They're recommended for home and tend to be more comfortable. Closed headphones isolate noise better and sound more like the music is in your head, not in the environment. They tend to be less comfortable and have some reverberation from sound waves bouncing off of the closed, plastic back. Some people like closed-backed for the booming bass sound and isolation, while some prefer open-backed for the natural and precise sound.  , A wider frequency range means you can hear more from the music; large ranges such 10 Hz to 25,000 Hz will often be recommended - anything within that range will be fine.   More importantly, notice the sound curve, frequency response curve, sound signature, whatever you want to call it. If the low end is higher on the line graph, there will be more bass. This does not mean that the bass will be more precise or better. For example, Beats headphones tend to be very bass boosted, yet the bass is commonly described as muddy and boomy with no precision. Typically, most headphones under $100 will have a U curve - meaning the mid-range is cut out. They may sound ""fun"" and pleasing to the ears at first, but you won't be able to analyze the layers of music easily. Flat response headphones don't favor any range, meaning you'll hear every layer of the music equally. However, the first impression if you're used to U curves is usually ""these have no bass"" or ""they sound boring"". Most people just need to grow into that sound signature to enjoy it.  , Anything less than around $200-250 isn't worth the price. Even if you're the frequent traveler type, noise-canceling, 90% of the time, just isn't worth the money. Some of your music might get canceled out as well, forcing you to turn up the volume. If you really do need noise reduction, however, look for brands like Etymotic, or Bose which have spongy earplugs that fill the ear canal.   A cheap way to cancel background noise might also be to just put over-ear hearing protectors (from the hardware store) over earbuds to cancel out most ambient noise. On the other hand, if you're not overly fussy, you may find lower priced noise-cancelling earbuds or headphones have considerable benefit for reducing background noise in airplanes, cars or public transportation. Panasonic (just one brand of many) makes an acceptable noise-cancelling earbud for just $50.  , The best way, really, to know if headphones can go loud enough for you is to test them out. Try on a friend's pair (if they're cool like that) or go to a good electronics store that will let you try on the headphones. Having around $200 in cash handy and going to a store with a 30-day return policy will make the electronics store your unwilling friend while you learn what types of headphones you really want. Out of courtesy, however, always clean the wax out of your ears before trying on any headphones or earbuds!  , To get the best out of your headphones, you should match the impedance of the headphones to the audio equipment you are using.This is measured in ohms. In reality if you don't this usually means that you will need to turn up the volume slightly compared to a matched pair of headphones.  , You are the person who is going to be using these headphones day in day out. If a $50 pair of headphones sounds the same as a $1000 pair of headphones, go for the cheaper pair. The sound quality is not going to change just because they are more expensive! The only thing to remember is the overall build quality of the headphones - are they going to last as long? Does it matter if they are that much cheaper?

Come prepared with a list of questions for your provider. Make sure you have your questions answered prior to obtaining medication. Some examples of questions you can ask are:What medications do you recommend? How long will medication use last? How will medication affect attention, concentration, and hyperactivity? Can I (or my child) take medication breaks on the weekends or during vacations?; , Your prescriber will put you on the medication that best suits your needs. Atomoxetine is a long-acting medication and can last 24 hours or more. This makes it appealing for people who have a difficult time “getting going” in the morning or notice the steep decline of functioning when medication starts to wear off. It is not as effective at treating symptoms of hyperactivity.Atomoxetine has antidepressant properties, which can be a good fit for people also struggling with symptoms of depression. Atomoxetine has a low potential for abuse or recreational use.If you have a history of prescription abuse or drug history, Atomoxetine may be a good alternative to stimulants. Ask your doctor about starting with a lose dose of medication and increasing it if necessary. This way you can determine the dosage with the most positive effects and least negative side effects. Don’t get frustrated if you don’t see an immediate response. Stick with the treatment plan and follow up with your doctor.  , Atomoxetine does not mix well with certain medications or medical conditions. If you have ever had glaucoma or pheochromocytoma, Atomoxetine is not advised. If you are taking or have stopped taking the following in the last two weeks, Atomoxetine is not advised: monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, including isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), or tranylcypromine (Parnate).It is not advised to take Atomoxetine if you have a heart condition or there is a high risk you may develop a heart condition. Recognize if you are allergic to any ingredients present in Atomoxetine. If so, do not take Atomoxetine., Prior to obtaining a prescription, let your provider know if you take other prescription medications, supplements, vitamins herbs, or recreational drugs.   Specifically, mention any use of the following: albuterol syrup or tablets (Proventil, Ventolin), amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone), bupropion (Wellbutrin), chlorpheniramine (antihistamine in cold medications),cimetidine (Tagamet), clomipramine (Anafranil), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem), haloperidol (Haldol), metaproterenol syrup or tablets, medications for high blood pressure, methadone (Dolophine), metoclopramide (Reglan), nefazodone, paroxetine (Paxil), quinidine, ritonavir (Norvir), and sertraline (Zoloft).Your prescriber may adjust your dosage or may monitor your symptoms closely.  , Medication is delivered in pill form and taken once or twice a day, either once in the morning or once daily and nightly. It’s advised to take the medication at the same time each day. Atomoxetine can be taken with or without food. Medication is to be swallowed whole; do not open, chew, or crush.Do not take more or less medication than prescribed. If you encounter any medication difficulties, contact your prescriber. Do not take Atomoxetine recreationally or as a “party drug.” Use only as directed., As with all prescription medications, Atomoxetine comes with the risk of experiencing side-effects. Some commonly reported side-effects include:Sleepiness Headache, dizziness Stomach upset, nausea Mood swings Insomnia Appetite suppression  , Some people may experience serious side-effects from Atomoxetine. Serious side effects can include fast or pounding heartbeat, chest pains, shortness of breath, weakness in your arms or legs, hives, rash, abnormal thoughts or behaviors, hallucinations, or seizures.If you experience serious symptoms, call emergency services right away.   If serious symptoms arise, discontinue medication use right away and contact your provider. Atomoxetine can cause liver damage in some patients. Notify your prescriber if you notice symptoms such as right upper belly pain, dark urine, yellow skin or eyes, itching, or unexplained flu-like symptoms., Risks for serious symptoms related to suicide are higher in children than adults. For some children, increased suicidal thoughts or behaviors may occur. This is a higher risk in children diagnosed with bipolar disorder or depression.The risk for suicidal tendencies increases at the beginning of medication treatment and when doses are adjusted.Tell your prescriber if your child or teen has a history of bipolar disorder or previous suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Call your provider immediately if your child shows signs of agitation, irritability, suicidal thoughts or actions, or if your child experiences any unusual changes in behavior.  , Continue to receive regular medical and psychological care while on Atomoxetine. Attend follow-up appointments to check in on Atomoxetine use and effectiveness. Note any difficulties or side-effects with your provider. Talk about any necessary adjustments to dosing as needed.Notify your prescriber before taking any newly prescribed medications as they may interact with Atomoxetine. Follow through on any tests your provider recommends to track effects of Atomoxetine such as blood, heart, and blood pressure checks. If problems are found, discontinue or decrease dosage.  , If you live with other people or have children in your home, keep the medication in a secure, locked location.This can safeguard against misuse, abuse, or accidental doses.   If medication is given to a child, administer single doses each day with supervision. If medications are taken at school, keep the medications with the school nurse, not in the child’s backpack or locker.  , If you miss a dose, take your dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular schedule. Do not make up for your missed dose. Do not take more than one dose in a 24 hour period.If you have questions about missing a dose, contact your provider.  , Even if you have a friend that struggles with attention, do not share your medication. Your prescription is for you and only you. If you share your medication, you are engaging in illegal activity that may be unsafe or cause harm to someone unknowingly.If you have a friend that struggles with symptoms of ADHD, recommend that he or she see a prescriber about medication or a therapist to learn coping skills.  , Even if you are prescribed Atomoxetine, do not take any medication that does not come directly from a pharmacy. These medications may be unsafe, expired, or mixed with other medications. Always receive medication from a prescription and always pick it up at the pharmacy., Therapy is an effective way to cope with symptoms of ADHD and make long-term improvements in functioning. While medications can be helpful in managing symptoms of ADHD, the thoughts and behaviors associated with ADHD are present when medications wear off. Therapy can help build skills such as organization, managing time effectively, and creating a daily schedule. Therapy can also help you or your child gain emotional skills such as coping with stress, managing impulsive behaviors, and controlling anger.When medication is coupled with therapy, the prognosis for ADHD symptoms improves.

Get together at a private meeting place where you can set up all of your computers, or you can alternatively use headphone sets to connect with each other over a chat line. Optional: print out a copy of these instructions so you can have a hard copy to look at the protocol systems when playing this game.; ,   If you do not do this properly, you and your teammates may not all reach the same server.  , It is best to play this game using a computer and not a smartphone because a computer mouse will have a faster reaction speed for maneuvering your slithering avatar the than the touchscreen for your phone.   To increase the speed of your mouse, go to your computer settings or type in ""mouse"" on the search bar from your start menu to reach the ""Mouse Properties."" From ""Mouse Properties,"" click the tab for ""Pointer Options,"" and use your cursor/arrow to click and drag the pointer speed to the rightmost or highest setting. Another way to increase your reaction time and prevent the game from buffering is to close all of your other idle computer programs. To increase reaction precision is to the keep the mouse cursor/arrow nearby the eyes of your avatar in order to allow for quick turning. A final tip to increase your scope of vision is to ""Restore Down"" your computer screen using the button next to the ""X"" button to close your web browser. This will cause the focus to zoom out, and show more of the game's playing field.  ,   Click the ""Share on Twitter"" or ""Share on Facebook"" button in the lower right-hand corner to share about the game and to unlock the custom skins. After sharing, click on the ""Change Skin"" button in the lower left-hand corner of the Slither.io game homepage. Click the right and left arrows to survey the different types of skins in the inventory. Discuss with your teammates which custom skin you would all like to use to identify each other by. Choosing the same skin will prevent you from accidentally attacking your teammates when you are playing the game. It is preferable to chose a unique skin like the ""green snake with one eye"" or the ""bright green snake with the smiley face"" because fewer other players use those skins.  , Each team member must assume one of the following Nicknames: {(Commander=1)}, {(Hunter=2)}, {(Hunter=3)}, and {(Hunter=4)}. Using the set brackets {} and parentheses () makes the name unique and easy to identify so you do not accidentally attack team members. Using these names also makes it easier to monitor the position of the Commander on the ""Leaderboard"" in the upper right-hand corner of the gameplay screen.   Discuss which Nickname each of you shall choose to prevent repeating a Nickname and to be clear on which Protocol System you will follow. Once you have decided which Nickname you will use, enter it into the ""Nickname"" bar on the Slither.io homepage and then you can click the ""Play"" button to start the game.  , Larger orbs will make you longer than small orbs. ""Moving orbs"" will give you the most length per orb, but you must sacrifice some of your length to reach them (see Game Rule 3 below). Don't run into other players. As a Hunter, you must try to get other players to run into you so you may ""kill"" them to gain their length by eating their orbs. Once longer, click and hold your left mouse button to increase speed. You will lose some of your length as you do this, but it can be helpful when trying to ""kill"" other players by getting them to run into you.  ,   In the upper right-hand corner there is the ""Leaderboard."" The goal is to make the Commander long enough to rank as the ""#1"" position. In the lower left-hand corner ""Your Length"" and ""Your Rank"" are shown. The arena map is located in the lower right-hand corner of the gameplay page. The light gray speckled areas signify large amounts of colored orbs. Larger patches of light gray speckles are likely to be Bloodbath zones. Do not go beyond the borders of the arena of the Gray Zone into the Red Zone. Your avatar will be vaporized on contact. Use the Quadrant System to communicate your location to your team members.  , As a hunter - {(Hunter=2)}, {(Hunter=3)}, and {(Hunter=4)} - use these strategies:   Length < 100 = Expendable Mode (EM): You may make risky attempts to kill larger players. Length > 100 = Defensive Mode (DM): Stay away from other players and increase your length by eating the colored orbs. Chase after the moving colored orbs when they are close enough. Length > 200 = Attack Mode (AM): Try to get other players to run into you so you can gain their length. Length > 300 = Proceed to ""Bloodbath"" Zone: Go to an area populated by lots of other players and try to get them to run into you or wait until they run into each other. Length > 1,000 = Hunter Mode (HM): You have reached official Hunter status. Your goal is to now trick as many other players into running into you as possible to get longer. Length > 2,000 = Circle Mode 1 (CM1): You may now trap other players by encircling them and forcing them to run into you. Length > 3,000 = Circle Mode 2 (CM2): You may now trap other players by encircling them and forcing them to run into you. Length > 4,000 = Proceed to Commander (PC): Once you have gotten between 4,000 and 5,000 in length, you must then go to the location of the commander. Length > 10,000 = 2nd Commander Status (C2): Once you have gotten to this stage, and are still shorter than current Commander, you are the Second in Command. This means, if the Commander is destroyed before reaching the #1 position on the Leaderboard, you will be the next in line to be the Commander. Remember, though, that the Commander remains the Commander until you have reach this stage and the Commander is jeopardized, you have reached the New Commander Status and are given consent to take over, OR the Commander decides to voluntarily relinquish their position outright. Length > Commander+500 = New Commander (NC): Once you have gotten at least 500 longer than the current Commander, you may – with the current Commander's consent – take the position of the Commander.  , As a Command - {(Commander=1)} - use the following strategies:   Do not proceed to Expendable Mode (EM) Do not proceed to a ""Bloodbath"" Zone Length > 100 = Defensive Mode (DM): Stay away from other players and increase your length by eating the colored orbs. Chase after the moving colored orbs when they are close enough. Length > 500 = Proceed to a Quadrant (PQ): Length > 1,000 = Commander Mode (CM): You have reached official Commander Status. Your goal is to stay away from all other players, eat orbs, and eat team players to increase your length after they have reached the ""Proceed to Commander"" Status. Length > 5,000 = Remain in Outer Region (ROQ): Choose one outer quadrant (UROQ, LROQ, ULOQ, or LLOQ), enter it, announce entry to team members, and stay at that location. Rank > #50 = Hunters Bypass Circle Mode 1 (Bypass CM2): When you have reached a length of 3,000 or more, Hunters may bypass CM2 and go directly to the Commander to contribute to his/her length. Rank > #10 = Hunters Bypass Circle Mode 2 (Bypass CM1): When you have reached a length of 2,000 or more, Hunters may bypass CM1 and go directly to the Commander to contribute to his/her length. Rank #1 = Relieve Commander Status: Once the Commander has successfully reached #1 on the Leaderboard, he/she may pass on the duty of Commander to the Hunter with the greatest length.  , To learn how to maneuver to attack other players and to learn how to defend against other player's attacks, the best method is to go into the midst of a highly populated area (normally found in the Bloodbath Regions of the Quadrant System).  ,   Enter your Nickname and press ""Play."" Announce your entry position on the Quadrant System to your teammates. Do this in order: {(Commander=1)}, {(Hunter=2)}, {(Hunter=3)}, and {(Hunter=4)}.  Follow the Commander or Hunter Protocol System. The Hunters must regularly update teammates about their statuses in the Protocol System (EM, DM, AM, etc.). The Commander should consistently update his/her location on the Quadrant System so that Hunters can proceed to the Commander to contribute to his/her length when they achieve PC, or are able to carry out Bypass CM2 or CM1.  , You have achieved ""Domination"" when each player can, in succession, become the #1 player on the Leaderboard by following the Hunter-Commander Protocol correctly. Another objective for Domination could be to achieve the most points.

This can usually be detected with the naked eye if you have a clear view of the sky and if you watch the sky for long enough.Stars twinkle and shimmer - hence, the song ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star."" Planets do not twinkle. They remain constant in their brightness and their overall appearance in the night sky. If viewed through a telescope, planets may appear to ""wiggle"" along the edges.Any object that blinks, twinkles, or shimmers is most likely a star. However, it could also be an aircraft if it is moving quickly across the night sky.; , Celestial objects are not fixed in the night sky. All celestial bodies move, but how those bodies move can be a good indication of whether they're stars or planets.Planets rise in the East and set in the West. They tend to follow a similar celestial path across our sky as the sun and moon. Stars move around in the night sky, but they do not rise or set. Instead, they orbit in a circular pattern around Polaris (the North Star). If the celestial object you see appears to move in a more-or-less straight line across the night sky, it is most likely a planet. Satellites also move across the night sky, but they do so much more quickly than planets. A planet may take hours or even weeks to cross the night sky, whereas a satellite can cross overhead in a matter of minutes.  , Planets are always found along an imaginary belt across the night sky called the ecliptic. This belt is not actually a visible object, but careful observation will help you find the location where celestial objects are congregated. While stars may also appear along this invisible belt, they should be distinguishable by their shimmering appearance.Of the celestial bodies along the ecliptic, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are significantly brighter than the surrounding stars. This is due to their proximity to the sun since their ""brightness"" is just reflected sunlight. The easiest way to find the ecliptic is to note the location and trajectory of the sun and moon in the sky relative to your location on the Earth. The sun's path across our sky is very close to the path of planets along the ecliptic., Not all planets are colorful. However, many of the most prominent planets in our night sky appear to have some type of coloration. This can help differentiate the planets from stars. While some people with exceptionally good vision may be able to detect subtle coloration, that coloration usually falls within the blueish white to yellowish white range.For most people, stars appear white to the naked eye.Mercury is typically gray or somewhat brownish in color.Venus appears pale yellow. Mars usually appears somewhere between pale pink and bright red. This is affected by the relative brightness or dimness of Mars, which changes on a two-year cycle.Jupiter appears orange with white bands. Saturn typically appears pale gold in color. Uranus and Neptune appear pale blue. However, they are not usually visible to the naked eye.  , While planets and stars both light up the night sky, planets typically appear much brighter than many stars.Astronomers measure the relative brightness of celestial objects using the astronomical magnitude scale, with most of the planets falling in the range of objects that are easily visible to the naked eye.Planets reflect the bright light of our solar system's sun, which is relatively close to the earth. Stars, by contrast, emit their own light. While some stars may be much brighter and larger than our sun, these stars are much farther from earth than the planets in our solar system. Because of this, the planets (which reflect our sun's light) typically appear brighter from earth.  , Whether you have poor night vision or are simply confused about the location of certain celestial bodies, a chart or guide can help you determine where to look. You can purchase star charts and planetary guides from a bookstore, print out free guides from the internet, or download a star/planetary guide app on your smartphone.Remember that star charts are usually only valid for a limited period of time (typically about one month). That's because the position of stars in the sky changes over time as the earth continues along its orbit. If you consult a star chart or planetary guide out in the field, make sure you use a dim red flashlight. These flashlights are designed to provide light without affecting your eyes' ability to adjust to the darkness.  , If stargazing with the naked eye isn't getting you enough celestial body views, you may want to consider using a telescope or binoculars. These instruments can help assist your view by magnifying the area you look at. This can make visible objects clearer and can even bring objects invisible to the naked eye into your view.Some experts recommend getting familiar with celestial bodies using the naked eye, then trying binoculars, and finally moving up to using a telescope. This can help you get more acclimated to the visible bodies and their place in the night sky. Compare telescopes and binoculars online before you invest in one. Read the reviews written by people who have owned a given model by searching online for the model you're interested in.  , Light pollution from urban areas can drastically limit your ability to see celestial bodies in the night sky. To really maximize visibility, you may want to consider visiting a dark-sky site.These designated sites have been identified by the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) as places worth protecting against encroaching light pollution and urban development.Common dark-sky sites include state and national parks, though other dark-sky sites are surrounded by well-lit, well-developed regions. Check the IDA website to find a dark-sky site near you.  , An occultation is when the moon passes between the Earth and a given star or planet, obstructing that celestial body's visibility. These obstructions happen somewhat regularly and can easily be planned around since their occurrence is predictable.Occultations may be visible from some locations on Earth and not from others. Check in advance to see whether an occultation is scheduled and whether your visibility will be significantly affected. You can find out about planned occultations by searching online or by consulting an astronomy guide. The international Occultation Timing Association publishes their predictions online for free., Light reflected off the moon can inhibit your ability to see stars and planets. If it is close to a full moon, you may have a hard time observing celestial bodies. For this reason, it's best to check on the current phase of the moon before venturing out to observe the night sky.If you aren't sure about the moon's current phase, you can consult an online guide to the moon's phases for free. The U.S. Navy's website allows you to check moon phases by date as far in advance as the year 2100., Knowing how to distinguish between stars and planets will only get you so far if the night sky is not very visible. Your ability to see celestial bodies can be limited by a number of factors, both man-made and naturally-occurring.Light pollution is one of the biggest limiting factors of night sky visibility. If you live in or near a metropolitan area, you will probably need to travel to a more rural area to increase visibility. Cloud cover and significant snow cover can both affect night sky visibility. If it's very cloudy or if the ground is significantly covered in snow, you may have a hard time seeing celestial bodies in the sky.  , There are many other factors can also affect night sky visibility, including some that you might be inflicting upon yourself. For example, your level of alcohol consumption, your nicotine consumption, and your pupil dilation at the time of viewing can all affect your ability to see celestial bodies. These factors all affect your eyes' ability to adjust to the dark and identify stars and planets in the night sky.","['color', 'moon', 'binoculars', 'relative brightness', 'star charts', 'dark-sky site', 'object', 'factors', 'good telescope', 'occultation', 'phase', 'planetary guides', 'right conditions']"

The prompt will also suggest whether you will be analyzing the continuities and changes over time for a place, theme, or specific topic.For example, a prompt might ask you to “Evaluate the extent of continuity and change in the lives of European immigrants in the United States between 1876 and 1918.""; , A thesis statement is the basic summation of your essay’s argument. For a CCOT essay, it must refer to both a continuity and change. Starting by writing out your thesis (one sentence is usually fine) will make it easier to focus on your argument as you right, and not get sidetracked   A thesis might look something like “While the United States maintained its position as a manufacturing superpower in the first five decades after WWII, over time its focus shifted from the production of traditional goods to the creation of innovative electronics.” Your thesis must specifically mention the time period.Be as direct as possible about the continuity and change over time.  , Unlike the DBQ (Document-Based Question) on the AP exam, you won’t be provided any sources to draw on when writing the CCOT essay. This means that you’ll have to rely on your own knowledge of world history.Jot down the basic facts you know about the topic, as well as any key details that stick out in your mind. Build your essay around these concrete details. For example, if your topic asks you to consider the development of manufacturing in the United States after WWII, start by writing down what you know about industries during that time period. If you know particular details about developments in the auto industry, you might work with those above all.  , Since the CCOT essay stresses development, it should clearly identify what changes happened when. Think of your essay as telling a story about history, and ask yourself: when was the climax during this time period?For instance, if you are writing about changes and continuities in manufacturing after WWII, you might argue that the Vietnam War and the fuel crisis of the 1970s decisively changed the shape of American industries.  Create a timeline of events to sort out your historical information in order and help identify the turning point.  , One of the quirks of the CCOT essay is that though it asks you to focus on a particular location and time, it also requires you to think about what was going on in the rest of the world at the time. You shouldn’t go into great detail about other locations and topics, but you’ll want to indicate something about how other world events contributed to your topic. Go ahead and start thinking about this as you plan your essay.Continuing with the manufacturing example, your might keep in mind that the fuel crisis of the 1970s led to a rise in imported, fuel-efficient cars, which impacted the auto industry in the United States.  , An introductory paragraph often isn’t necessary for the AP exam (ask your teachers about their preferences if you are writing for class). Often, you can begin the essay with your thesis statement right off the bat. If you do have an introductory paragraph, make sure that your thesis statement is the last sentence in the paragraph., There are lots of potential ways you can organize your essay, and there’s no one right or wrong method. However, discussing the changes before the continuities can help your argument come across more clearly. This is the most common way to organize a CCOT essay, and getting the pattern down through practice will give you one less thing to worry about when you actually sit down to take the exam.Create an outline to serve as the framework for your essay. For example, you might have a first paragraph that establishes your thesis and the conditions at the start of the time period. This could be followed by two paragraphs on changes that occurred over time. Finally, the essay could close with a paragraph on what stayed the same.  , Though CCOT essay prompts usually ask you to think about broad time periods, you’ll nevertheless want yours to be as specific as possible, and rich in details. As a rule of thumb, try to include 2-3 specific examples in each paragraph.Be selective and organize your thoughts. Don’t just dump out everything you know about a subject. Stay in the place and time relevant to the prompt. If a prompt asks you to think about the development of manufacturing in the United States, your evidence shouldn’t be based on examples from manufacturing in China. On the other hand, don’t forget to explain the global significance of your topic. For instance, at some point in your essay, you might note that changes in manufacturing in the United States led to an increasing rise in imported home goods manufactured in China.  , Your essay should clearly state what changed about the topic. To go beyond the basics and write a really good CCOT essay, however, you’ll have to explain the causes of the change(s). This shows your teacher or the exam reader that you know how to analyze a historical situation, not just describe it.If you get stuck, go back to the notes/ideas you had about the turning point, since this can show you exactly what changed, when, and why.  , There are two components to how the CCOT essay is scored on the exam, the Basic Core and the Expanded Core. You can earn up to 7 points for the Basic Core of the CCOT essay, broken down in this way:1 point for having an acceptable thesis Up to 2 points for addressing all parts of the question Up to 2 points for effectively using appropriate historical evidence 1 point for explaining the changes in terms of world history and global contexts 1 point for analyzing the process of continuity and change over time  , The Expanded Core offers up to 2 additional points for the CCOT essay. You can earn these points by going above and beyond in writing your essay and analyzing your topic.For example, including several relevant examples of changes and continuities will help you earn points in the Expanded Core. You cannot earn points in the Expanded Core unless your essay already covers all aspects of the Basic Core.  , Writing lots of CCOT essays ahead of time is a sure-fire way to improve your skills. If you’re taking a class, you’ll have opportunities to do this. Reviewing your writing and getting feedback from your teacher will also help you learn about things you can easily do to write a more successful CCOT essay. For instance:Don’t use evidence from the wrong time period. Using the example of Captain Cook won’t help you if the essay asks you to examine continuities and changes in work exploration between 1400 and 1700. Avoid vagueness of dates. Don’t write an essay that discusses “exploration before the eighteenth century.” Instead, tell your readers that your essay will discuss changes and continuities from 1492 (Columbus’ first voyage) to Hudson’s voyage of 1609-1611. Don’t just dump as many facts as possible into your essay. Organize and analyze all information you include, making sure it is relevant.

"['know the occasion', 'know what the person may want or need', 'set a budget', 'make a gift', 'get an ""experience"" gift', 'rather than a material gift', 'look online']",How to Choose a Gift," Depending on the theme of the party and the age and gender of the host, different gifts would be recommended. You'd get a 13-year-old girl something different than a 28-year-old man, of course. Think of the purpose of party. Are they getting married? Is it for their graduation? Think of these things and you may know already what to get. The present should be something they could use for the purpose of the event e.g. baby items for a baby shower. Below are some sample ideas for different occasions. Try a few of these or think of your own.   Mom's birthday/Mother's Day. Try jewelry, a cookbook (if she likes cooking), a book she'd love to read, a movie you can watch together, or a poem you wrote about her. Dad's birthday/Father's Day. Get tickets to a sports game, a mug with a funny saying, a watch, or a scrapbook of your memories together. Teenager's party. Get gift cards to the movies, CD's/iTunes gift cards, a journal, a T-shirt, or a movie. Gift for a young child. Get a stuffed animal, an easy book, bubble blowers, crayons/markers, toy trucks, or barbies (or other toys). Gift for your friend. Get a photo frame for a picture of you two, a gift card to their favorite store, a magazine, a book, or some origami. Baby shower. Get pajamas, bottles, blankets, books, toys, bibs, soaps, nursery lamp, or baby powder. Wedding. Get cookware, a frame, a platter, ornaments, a wedding canvas, pillowcases, or a vase.  , This step could be the hardest part, but is possibly the most important. You'd want to get them something that is useful and something they like, right? Think of their interests. Are they into soccer? Art? Reading? Ask another person on what they are into. Ask their sibling, parent, or a friend of them to give some ideas without giving away the secret. Or, simply ask them if they have a wish list, either on a website, or a verbal one. Just ask for some ideas or ask what they like, but you can keep it a surprise if you want.   Are they always saying, ""I could really use a _________"", or ""I can't believe I lost/broke my ________."" There's a gift idea!  , Always set a budget. Once you start to get some gift options, make sure you aren't paying too much or too little. The gift doesn't have to be expensive. It's the thought that counts. On the other hand, you shouldn't be paying too little. If you're low on cash, just get a 15 or 20 dollar gift card to a place they like. Look online for great deals. But, avoid the dollar store. That's a little cheap to go there for a gift, but it may give you ideas for one. Think of the item. Should I be paying $30 for a T-shirt?. No. What about $15?. Better. Just use your brain.  , This has 2 positive reasons: if you're low on cash, you don't have to worry about spending a fortune, and it shows how much you care. This is especially great for family members. Instead of just buying a card and signing your name on it, why not make one yourself? Gather up some photos of you and the person you are giving the card to, some markers, paper, stickers, and a few other items and you could make some of these things:   A scrapbook of your memories A photo frame with a picture of you An A-Z list of memories A CD of a song you made together A video of a dance you two made Top 10 reasons why they're the best ""Coupons"" e.g. one free sleepover  , Experience gifts include tickets to a game or concert, a vacation, dance lessons, skydiving, and more. These could be very pricey, but are great to give because they'll usually teach them something new or maybe even be a life changing event. Don't feel like you have to get one, but the receiver will be so happy that you got them an experience gift.  , Many deals are online only, and some items are online only. Search up a gift you might want to get and see what pops up. Look at ratings and reviews. You could get extra savings or maybe even a free gift, so consider buying the present online.

"['burn the flag discreetly', 'cut up the flag', 'bury the flag', 'give the flag to a qualified organization', 'recycle old flags']",How to Retire a U.S. Flag3," Once you have lowered your flag and properly folded it, you will want to find a private place to dispose of the flag. The preferred method of disposal is to burn your flag in a large fire. Make sure that it is big enough to properly destroy the flag, but not so large that it is a safety hazard.Once the flag is destroyed, bury the ashes.   Be sure to check with local burn bans before you dispose of your flag. Because many modern flags are treated with chemicals that can burn explosively and give off toxic fumes, burning your flag may cause an accident.  , If you are unable or do not wish to burn your flag, you can also cut it into pieces. Once a flag has been cut up, it is no longer an official U.S. flag and can be disposed of in various methods. When cutting up the flag, you will want to ensure that you do not cut into the blue star field. This section should remain whole, but you can cut the rest of the flag as you see fit. Once the flag is properly cut up, you can dispose of it however you want.Use scissors or a knife to cut the flag. Avoid tearing the flag. This can be considered disrespectful. The blue star field represents the unity of the U.S. states, and cutting into that section is considered a symbolic attempt to disrupt that unity. Some may consider this method less ceremonial or disrespectful. Use your discretion, or talk to someone with experience disposing of flags, before you cut up a flag.  , Once a flag is worn, you can fold it up, place it in a box and bury it. As long as you are respectful about how you bury the flag, this is a good alternative to burning. Be sure to place the flag in a box. Letting the soil touch the flag is considered disrespectful, even if you disposing of a flag.This method could also be considered disrespectful or improper. Considering that flags are coated in various chemicals to preserve them, this might be a less environmentally friendly option. Unlike flags made from natural fibers like cotton that decompose quickly, modern flags are typically made from synthetic materials that breakdown over a much longer period of time.  , Groups like the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Girls Scouts, and the Boy Scouts will take your old flags and properly dispose of them. The old flags are typically burned during disposal ceremonies, which are held at different times throughout the year. If you are unsure about the best method of disposing of your U.S. flag, this may be a good option.The American Legion holds a flag disposal ceremony on Flag Day each year., If you are concerned about limiting your flag’s environmental impact, you might want to consider sending it to a company that specializes in recycling old flags. They will ensure that the flag is disposed of in an environmentally conscious way.

That does not mean they can leave the information they have stored on their computer systems unsecured and unprotected. Instead, it means they need to be smarter about how they manage their computer security systems. They need to follow steps that will keep the information they have stored as safe as their clients, customers, and employees expect.; , Small businesses face the same risks that big businesses face when it comes to cyber security. Their computer systems can be infected with viruses and malware that slow down their computers. Their systems can also be breached by hackers who are searching for private information that a small business may keep. Depending on the type of business, the amount of private information about clients and customers can be extensive.   Addresses, email addresses, and other information about customers and clients. Credit card information used for purchases. Sensitive private identification numbers such as social security numbers and tax identification numbers. (This is especially common in small healthcare businesses.)  , If a small business does not protect information entrusted to them, they can easily lose trust, revenue and could face fines and sanctions.  , Each should have antivirus software that is up to date and is turned on. This is the most basic protection and is essential.  , The amount of security needed depends on the sensitivity of the information stored on the computer. Extra security should be in place for more sensitive information.  , This is a fairly new product which can help a company overcome financial difficulties if their computer systems are breached.  , It is important to not only monitor employees to make sure they are not putting computers at risk, it is also important to monitor any private devices that an employee may use on the business network.  , Every business should have policies in place to protect their computer systems. The employees should all sign a form indicating they have read the policies and there should be consequences when employees break those policies.  , The biggest reason a small businesses will use for not doing anything about cyber security is the cost. The reality is that the cost of a cyber security system for a small business does not have to be prohibitive. The cost of an anti-virus program, for instance, is not as large some businesses may think. Many of the other steps to improve cyber security don’t cost much at all--if anything.  , The cost of having a computer system breached is often much higher than the cost to secure it. Globally, the cost of breaches in cyber security for all businesses could reach $3 trillion. Each instance can result in lost productivity, lost data that has to be recreated and lost revenue.  , Not everyone will agree about the type of cyber security, or even how much security a small business needs. One thing they can agree on is that the threats to all computers are real no matter what size the business. They also know the threats will continue to grow and a small business needs to act before it is too late.

"['pay attention to what matters most', 'experience things rather than make excuses', 'find time for your passions', 'revel in joyfulness', 'learn to be grateful']",How to Be Extraordinary2," Like most people, you probably feel the drive to make more money, get more things, and look better. However, extraordinary people realize that these things don't matter as much as learning to focus on the things that make you truly happy.For instance, being in a relationship with people you love and trust is important, and that doesn't have to be sexual. Friendships can be just as important as having a lifetime partner. You just need to be with people that you trust enough to be emotionally vulnerable with. This step also means valuing experiences over things. Things just fill up your house, while experiences make you feel alive and invigorated.  , Part of what makes life enjoyable is the experiences you have, from eating a fabulous dinner to watching a sunrise to taking a painting class. When life gets busy, you're likely to find excuses not to have new experiences, as everyone does. But making sure you take the time to get out and try new things is integral to making you an extraordinary person.Think of it this way. When you think of extraordinary people, do you think of someone who sits at home every night? No, extraordinary people have extraordinary and interesting experiences. Start making plans. Decide you're going to try at least one new thing a week, and stick to it. Making plans with other people can help you stick to it. Also, don't be afraid to be spontaneous. Feel like going to the beach? Take a mental health day from work and take that three hour drive down to the beach. Sure, you'll be tired at the end of the day, but you'll also feel exhilarated and more alive.  , Just like the experiences you have, your passions help make your life fuller and you a more interesting person. Following your passions helps engage your curiosity and keep your spark of life alive.Maybe you've lost touch with your love of painting, but it used to make you happy. Try picking it up again. Join a club in your area, or find a class at your local community college. If you're not sure what you're really passionate about, start exploring interests. Check out books from the library on hobbies and ideas that catch your attention, or start taking community college classes that catch your interest. If you hear about an event that piques your interest, go to it to see what it's about.  , Sometimes, when that moment of pure joy comes around, you may find yourself not giving into it. You're holding back a bit because you're afraid of when the next bad thing is going to hit. However, learning to really dig down into joyfulness can make you a more joyful person overall, and in turn, a more extraordinary person, as few people are able to live joyfully.  The next time you find yourself in a happy situation, take some time to be in the moment. Let yourself fill up with the emotion. Take in the joy on the faces of people around you. Savor the sensations of the food you're eating or the feeling of sand and water between your toes.  , Gratitude is sometimes hard when life throws curve balls at you left and right. Nonetheless, being grateful is another way to learn how to live an extraordinary life because it helps you appreciate what you have and what's most important to you, a rare quality.One way you can learn gratitude is to take time each day to think or write about things you are grateful for. You could write down 3 things each day in a journal that you are thankful for or even post 3 things you are grateful for on social media every day for your friends to see. You could also just take time each night to think about the things you are grateful for in your life. Express your gratitude. When you're thankful for a person or what they've done, tell that person. Writing a note is even better, because it makes you take time to really feel that gratitude. Plus, it lets the other person know they are appreciated.

You may feel less sad about your friend leaving if you have tangible memories on hand. Try to take some pictures, videos, and voice recordings of you and your friend. This can help the two of you say goodbye. You'll feel less sad about your friend's absence if you know you have something to remember him or her by., As stated, your friend is probably already overwhelmed with his or her move. You do not want to dump your sadness on your friend. Seek out support from other friends and family members. Talk to them about how you're feeling about saying goodbye to your friend.Ask someone if you can talk to them first, explaining you need to sort out your feelings about your friend's coming move. Ask them if they can simply listen to you talk for a bit, and then let them know how you're feeling. Choose someone who's empathetic, like a kind older relative or close mutual friend. Select someone who's listened to you in the past when you've been going through difficult times.  , A goodbye party can be a great way to mark the end of an era. Ask your mutual friends if they'd consider getting together to say goodbye to the friend who's moving. This will give your friend a chance to talk to everyone one last time.Consider planning some party events that help promote closure. For example, you could all give a brief speech saying goodbye. You could also all sign a goodbye card for your friend. Do not expect a goodbye party to be all fun and games. You should expect there will be some tears and sadness as well. This is normal. Do not try to force your friend or your guests to only experience feelings of happiness.  , Consider giving your friend a goodbye gift. This can help both of you feel some closure. Your friend will have something to remember you by, and you'll feel like you're getting a chance to say goodbye in an official way.   You do not have to spend a lot of money on a goodbye gift. It can be something sentimental that reflects your relationship. For example, if you and your friend loved a particular coffee shop, buy him or her a cheap mug from that shop. You can also make a creative gift for your friend. Write him or her a poem commemorating your friendship. Make a collage of photos of the two of you.  , When your friend moves, you should recognize that negative feelings are normal. You should not expect to bounce back from the transition quickly. It's okay to allow yourself to feel what you are feeling, whether it's good or bad.It's normal to feel sad when a friend is gone, especially if you were particularly close. While you'll still stay in touch, you can't simply go over to your friend's house at the end of a long day anymore. It's normal to feel disappointed and frustrated with this transition. You also may feel some anxiety. Your friend is going to meet new people in his or her new location. You may worry about being replaced or forgotten. Such anxieties are also very normal. If your friend moved away for positive reasons, such as a new job or getting into a great college, you may feel guilty for feeling sad. You may feel as if you should be happy for your friend and his or her great new life. However, it's okay to feel sad. Any transition is bound to result in mixed emotions. You can be happy for your friend, but still feel sad as you'll miss him or her.  , Bottling up your feelings during a rough transition is a bad idea. You need to be able to express your feelings in order to work through them. As we've already discussed, you can talk to a trusted friend or family member. You can also express your feelings in writing. Journaling about your emotions a few times a week can help you process the transition., Take some time to reflect after your friend moves. Moving can create a strange feeling. The friendship is not over, but it has changed dramatically. Things will not be the same from here on out. Take some time to reflect on your friendship when you were living in the same place.Try to see both the positive and negatives. You will have some regrets when a friend moves. There's probably a lot the two of you never got a chance to do together, for example. However, you should also be grateful for the time you did have.  , Sometimes, adjustment simply takes time. When a close friend moves away, you may feel odd in his or her absence. You may be unsure of what to do with yourself on weekends, for example, or feel lost when you don't know who to drop in on after a stressful day. This is all normal. Do not try to force yourself to feel better quicker than what feels natural. Allow yourself the necessary time to adjust to a friend's absence.  , If may take awhile to adjust to the absence of a good friend. Find ways to keep yourself busy in your friend's absence. Spend time with other friends or family members. Seek out new hobbies or activities that will occupy your time.   If you had a certain day of the week you typically spent with your friend, find ways to fill your time on that day. For example, maybe you always had dinner with your friend on a Friday night. Make regular plans with another friend on that night or join a club that meets on Fridays. Reach out to other friends. While you may miss your friend who moved away, you should work on strengthening your relationships with your friends who still live near you. These friends are probably missing the friend who moved away as well, and will appreciate you wanting to reach out. Find new hobbies. If you're unsure what to do with yourself in your friend's absence, finding new ways to pass the time can help. Explore your interests. If you've always been interested in cooking, for example, try enrolling in a cooking class.  , It's normal to feel sad when a friend moves away. However, certain mental health conditions, like clinical depression, can make adjusting to change more difficult.If you have been previously diagnosed with a mental health condition, or if you suspect you may be struggling with a condition like depression, seek the assistance of a therapist.   You can find a therapist by asking your regular doctor for a referral. You can also find a therapist through your insurance provider. If you are a college student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your college or university.  , While your friend has moved, be grateful for modern technology. It's easier than ever to stay in touch with e-mail and text, both of which send messages instantaneously. Try to keep up regular correspondence via e-mail. Send your friend an e-mail every couple of weeks, updating him or her on how you're doing. You can also text your friend every day, just making small observations and asking how your friend is doing., Random, long conversations do not have to end simply because a friend moved. Even if your friend is thousands of miles away, you can call or video chat regularly. Try to schedule regular Skype, Facetime, or Google hangout sessions. You can also simply call your friend on the phone. Agree, for example, to call or video chat every other Tuesday., Social media makes it very easy to stay in touch with friends who have moved. Take advantage of things like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. You can get updates about your friends day-to-day activities via social media outlets, making you feel like the distance is not insurmountable.You can also play games from a distance via outlets like Facebook and your smart phone. Trivia games, and games like Words With Friends, can make you feel like your friend is right there with you hanging out.  , While it's easy to stay in touch with a long distance friend, you will still probably communicate less than you did when you were living in the same place. At first, you may call or text constantly as you'll be missing each other a lot. However, as you both adjust and meet new people, communication may become more infrequent.   This is not necessarily a bad thing and it does not have to mean the two of your are growing apart. Many people have long distance friends who they feel very close with, even if they only communicate on occasion. You may find that, when you and your friend do talk, you feel like no time has passed at all, even if it's been months.  , Even if your friend has moved away, you may still be able to see each other on occasion. Try to get together once a year, or every other year. If your friend still has relatives living in your area, he or she may be around over holidays. While visits may be somewhat infrequent, you may find you value your friend's presence more when you two only see each other once a year.

Experience them but do not show it. Keep your experience of your emotions limited to inside yourself.   This will take practice. You can watch emotional movies or TV shows if you want to practice holding back your emotions. Try episodes of WWYD on Youtube.; , When something happens that brings out an emotional response in you, physically react as little as possible. Keep your facial expressions in check and don't cry or get visibly angry.   Try thinking about something else, if you can. If you struggle with that, sing a song inside your head to manually focus on something else.  , When someone asks you a question, say as little as you can. When you're feeling emotional, don't tell people what you're thinking or feeling, or say anything that might give it away.  , In general, speak as little as possible. This will give you a more stoic appearance, but it will also help you practice for times when you're trying to minimize your emotional response.  , Much like responding to questions as little as possible, you shouldn't just tell people things about yourself, your thoughts, or your feelings.  , Complaining is a sure sign of a lot of internal emotions, like anger and sadness, so avoid it. Instead of complaining about things that bother you, take the situation into your own hands and fix the problem yourself.  , Bottling emotions and not dealing with them, as the above methods can lead to, is very unhealthy. Make sure you find a healthy way to express your emotions later, in private. This can be yelling or crying into a pillow, writing your feelings and thoughts in a journal, or whatever else you find works for you.  , The idea behind Stoicism is that our negative emotions can lead us to make bad decisions and generally make our life worse. Since emotions are often illogical responses, Stoicism seeks to solve emotional problems by applying logic to the situation. Try to apply logic to the situations in your daily life to practice for when you find yourself in emotional situations.  , You may think that living a certain way or doing certain things is less than another way of living, and thinking that way can lead to lots of negative emotions, when things don't go your way or people disagree with you. Consider your biases and think about other ways of looking at those situations. This will make it easier to cope with problems.  , The goal of Stoicism is not to minimize all emotion but instead to minimize negative emotions. This philosophy seeks to make you happier in your life by reducing the impact of emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and envy. Doing this should be your main goal as a budding Stoic.  , While minimizing your experience of negative emotions, you should practice allowing and encouraging yourself to be happy. Getting depressed or banishing happy thoughts can become almost a habit for some people, and breaking that habit should be another goal if you find that quality in yourself.  , Humans tend to always want the next best thing. No matter how great the things we have are, we'll always find something to be unhappy with. Stoicism seeks to retrain your brain so that you learn to be happier with the things that you do have.  , A part of learning to be happier with the things we have is to learn to find happiness in the world around us. We get a little jaded sometimes (and it is a jaded age, for sure) but if you stop and realize that the world around you is so incredible, you find yourself enjoying your life more. Stop and embrace the moment. Let yourself be filled with amazement and wonder.   Think about it: you have a phone the size of your hand that you can take anywhere and call anyone in the world. That's amazing. You're living in a sci-fi novel! Even the natural world is incredible. Did you know that there are trees that are taller than the Statue of Liberty or Big Ben? Incredible!  , When we get attached to things, people, or situations, we tend to be more prone to big emotional swings when we lose those things. The Stoic philosophy teaches us to be open to and accepting of change, giving up the sense of permanence that can cause devastation when loss occurs.  , Learn more about Stoicism by reading up on the Stoic philosophers, if you want to fully embrace the philosophy. Stoicism, which was practically a religion in ancient times, was highly regarded and widely practiced by people of class and education, making the things that were written about it widely available and very interesting. Famous historical figures like Seneca and Marcus Aurelius were devoted Stoics and wrote extensively about their beliefs. Look them up!  , When you find yourself getting angry at something that's happening around you: stop. Think. Is getting angry going to help the situation? No. Your emotional reaction will do little to change the situation. Instead, it is your actions that will make the changes you want to see. When things make you angry, look for what needs to be done to fix the problem and do that.  , If a person is making you angry or frustrated, try to see the problem through their eyes. Realize that we all make mistakes. People rarely do things to be malicious or cause problems. They usually think that they're doing the right thing. Try to understand why they made the mistake that they did and forgive them for it, then move on to making things better.  , Don't try to shove sadness out of your life. Don't ball it up and never deal with it. This is very unhealthy. Instead, experience it and move on quickly. Be sad for a few days and then get back to life. No matter why you're sad, staying away from happiness won't make your life better, only worse.  , This is called negative visualization. Negative visualization is a common training trick and everyday practice for Stoics. This is when you imagine your life without something that is very important to you. Maybe you imagine that you lost your job, or that your spouse divorces you, or your child is taken away from you. It sounds upsetting, and it definitely isn't fun to do, but it will significantly increase your enjoyment of the good things in your life, and teach you how to cope with loss by preparing yourself for it.  , This is called projective visualization. This is another practice. Although it is less effective than the first, it can be more useful when you are actively dealing with something that upsets you. The idea here is to imagine this bad thing that is happening to you is happening to someone else. What advice would you give them? How would your opinion of the situation change? Usually, when something bad happens to someone else, we tell them that we feel very bad for them but that sometimes these things just happen. And that's the truth of the situation: things happen that we can't control and being overly upset about it won't make things any better. Apply these ideas to your own situation and it may help you to feel better.  , Enjoy what you are doing right now, while you are doing it. As we said before, the human tendency is to be a little bit unhappy no matter what we're doing, but you should fight back that feeling to appreciate the situation that you're in right now. This is an area where negative visualization can be useful. Just remember that the world is an incredible place, and no matter how bad things seem, there are still waterfalls, birds in brilliant colors, children who sing songs, and people who love you.  , Stoics fight against a sense of permanence, against the idea that things should or will always be the same. What we have to remember is that change is good. When things we love come to an end, that can be hard to accept, but try to remember that something good ending only opens up the possibilities for more good things to come into your life. When bad things are happening to you and it feels like they'll never end, it is still important to remember that that is not the case.   This is when the common Stoic mantra, as popularized by Joseph Campbell, comes in to play: ""This too shall pass."" Just repeat that phrase until you feel better.  , The most important application of Stoicism to your life is to appreciate what you have while you have it. Don't complain about your girlfriend's snoring or your baby crying or your dog wanting to play too much. These are things you'd miss if you didn't have them. Appreciate them and tell them how much you love them every moment that you can.

Mix and match clothes to make cool combinations, and don't forget to accessorize.For example, you can wear trendy skinny jeans and top it off with a graphic tee that displays a picture of your favorite movie or music group.; , Make sure you are clean and fresh, and avoid looking like you just rolled out of bed. If you're a girl or you just like makeup, try that new makeup you've always admired. Don't be afraid to try new things!  , It's always fun to play with your hair, and maybe you've recently seen a new hairstyle but were too afraid to try it out. Now's your chance! A new hairstyle can be a great conversation starter, and it's the perfect way to grab people's attention.  , Wear a piece of jewelry that tells a story, like a necklace with your favorite animal or a bracelet that holds a picture of your pet.

One piece at a time will suffice.  , If you are shy and quiet by nature, that's okay! Try to reach out of your comfort zone and people will notice. Join in on a conversation with some popular people, but don't force yourself to be someone that you're not. Talk to everyone, don't leave people out, and you will surely be noticed., It's not that easy for some, but confidence will help with becoming popular. Keep eye contact during conversation, stand up tall, always keep your head up and smile.Faking confidence on the outside can help you become more confident on the inside.Get out there and have fun!  , You might be inclined to hide away, but try not to.

Always build people up, and never be a bully!If someone you admire is wearing a cool outfit, tell them you like it and ask them where they got their clothes from. It's an easy conversation starter.  , If you hang out with some unpopular kids, don't ditch them! Hang out with everyone. Be nice to people and make new friends. People will appreciate this and if they don't, they're not worth your time.  , Talking about your assignments for a class you share is a great ice breaker. Whether you're picking a study date so you guys can study together or complaining about how hard you think the next test is going to be, it's an easy way to start a conversation with a classmate you haven't talked to before. Ask them questions about their favorite artist, hobbies, or food, and try to get to know them.   You can say something like, “This test is going to be hard. Do you want to help each other study?” Invite them over to your house for the study date. Once you're hanging out and studying together, turn on some music and ask them what they would like to listen to. Offer them snacks, and try to get to know them better. Keep the conversation flowing throughout your study time.  , Who doesn’t love a good story? If something someone said reminds you of a related story, tell them the story! It's a great way to catch people's attention and keep them interested.For example, if someone happens to mention their dog, tell them a funny story about your dog that their story reminded you of. Amusing stories have the power to grab people's attention and make you appear super interesting.  , Make sure the club features an activity you enjoy or are interested in learning more about.

Knowing that age matters ahead of time can save you from trouble and potential heartbreak in the future.   In high school, there’s generally more division of social groups based on grades as well. Understand that the activities seniors engage in may be very different from what you are used to. For example, it’s common for seniors to go out and party more than freshmen. Don’t engage in any dangerous or illegal activities just to spend time around your crush.; , Sexual acts between a minor and someone who is legally an adult (18+) is called statutory rape. The age of consent varies from state to state but generally charges can be brought against an 18 year old if they are caught in a compromising situation with a minor so be safe and don’t break the law.Understand that this is one major drawback of dating an older person in high school. If they start pressuring you to engage in sexual acts that you are not ready for, stay true to yourself and don’t cave. If they do not respect your boundaries, it’s time to end the relationship.  , In terms of expectations and daily life, being a senior can be pretty different from being a freshman. After all, seniors are in their last year of high school and therefore have to prepare for the future. Oftentimes, this means that seniors are busier with college applications, job searches, testing, socializing, and more. Be prepared for and accepting of these and any other grade-related differences.Not only are there differences in terms of workload and social groups, but freshmen and seniors also differ in terms of maturity, both physical and psychological. Because of this, it may be inadvisable to get into a relationship with someone who is much older than you unless you are both sure that you’re at a similar level in terms of emotional and psychological maturity, which will lead to the two of you making safe, healthy decisions., Don’t push your boundaries or let anyone else cross them. Always be sure to firmly establish what the boundaries are in your relationship (should you end up in one). Otherwise, you may find yourself in an uncomfortable situation.These boundaries are not only physical but also mental and emotional. Decide what you want out of a relationship beforehand and don’t stay with someone who doesn’t respect the boundaries that you have decided on. For example, if you end up going to parties where seniors are drinking or doing drugs, don’t feel pressured to join in. And if your crush (or anyone else for that matter) pushes you to do things you’re uncomfortable with, that’s a clear sign to walk away. One in three adolescents in the United States is a victim of physical, sexual, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner.Keep yourself safe by watching for warning signs, such as aggression, threats, or manipulative behaviors. As a freshmen, you are more vulnerable to be on the receiving end of relationship abuse as seniors tend to be older, bigger, and may see themselves as having power over you. If you feel unsafe or think you may be in an abusive or unhealthy relationship, seek help from a trusted family member or other adult.  , You want to start by finding out basic information, such as whether they are already in a relationship or not. It’s always best to know ahead of time and if it turns out they are unavailable, you could still get to know them as friends!   To find out this information, ask around but try to be discreet about it and only ask friends you know you can trust. After all, you don’t want the word getting around that you are interested in someone without getting a chance to know them first! If you don’t already know their age, find out! After all, if you are in the older end of your grade and your crush is young for their grade, there might not even be much of an age gap between you two.  , Getting to know what your crush’s hobbies are will not only give you something to talk about, but will also inform you if you two are actually a good fit. After all, an infatuation may be based on being attracted to someone’s looks, but a relationship requires having similar interests and goals and it’s better to find out sooner rather than later if you aren’t actually compatible with your crush.   For example, ask around to see if they are involved in any sports, clubs, or extracurricular activities. Or, if you already speak to each other from time to time, make a point of casually asking your crush about what they’re into. Maybe they’re secretly a film buff or love to draw and you do too. Don’t be afraid to ask as you may end up having some unexpected interests in common! Once you’ve learned about some of their activities, you can include yourself in them, especially if they are school-related, such as a sports or club. Just be sure to do it if you are also actively interested in the activity--never do something just for the sake of being around your crush.  , If you haven’t talked to your crush before, make a point of doing so! After all, the best way to get to know a person is simply by talking to them. Though the grade difference may intimidate you at first, if your crush is a kind, mature person, they’ll look beyond that and treat you like any other human being.   Since there are very few private places in school, you may always feel like you have an audience watching you when you approach your crush. You can either decide to just ignore the onlookers or approach your crush in a more relaxed setting, such as at the beginning or end of the lunch period or between classes. Be relaxed and direct in introducing yourself. Avoid blushing, giggling, or otherwise showing signs of nervousness as that can just make both you and your crush feel awkward. Keep the introduction short and simple by saying something along the lines of, “Hey my name is _____ and I just wanted to say hi because I’ve seen you around and you seem like a really cool person.” If you have a sibling or other friends who are seniors, you can also ask them to introduce you to your crush. That’ll take some of the pressure off of you and also give your crush more of a reason to get to know you.  , Learning more about your crush’s values, faith, and culture can teach you a great deal about who they are as a person and, again, show you whether you two would actually be compatible dating.   Ask them questions about their religion, beliefs, or background but do it in a way that isn’t overly prying or obnoxious. Just take a sincere interest in getting to know them as a person and pick up on nonverbal cues. For example, if they only tell you the bare minimum about their family or what they believe in, don’t press them and instead move onto another subject or tell them a little bit about yourself. After all, the goal is to get to know your crush and if you interrogate them too much, you may end up driving them away!  , It’s not just a cliche--being yourself is likely one of the most crucial steps to attracting your crush. After all, you don’t want your crush to fall for a fake version of yourself and if they are not interested in you, you’ll know right from the get-go that this isn’t the person for you and not to waste your time.   For example, if you prefer reading and watching movies over going to your high school football games, don’t pretend that you’re a huge sports fan. You want your crush to like you for you, not the person you're pretending to be.  , Perhaps the biggest difference between being a senior and a freshman is that everything in the school is new for freshmen. After a few years, most students develop more confidence and ease and this comes naturally with age. However, if you want to attract a senior, you will have to project that same sort of laidback confidence.   Be aware of your body language. Everyone picks up on body cues subconsciously so communicate confidence with good posture, direct eye contact, and an easygoing smile. If you are feeling uncomfortable or insecure, fake it til you make it. Laugh and smile a lot and try to keep things in stride. For example, if someone insults you while you are talking to your crush, make a lighthearted joke about it rather than getting upset or depressed.  , People are interested in dating those with the same maturity level and so, as you get to know your crush, aim to match their maturity level. Depending on your individual personalities, this may not require all that much effort on your part. Girls also tend to mature more quickly than boysso if you are a freshman girl interested in a senior guy, you may find your levels of maturity are actually similar.   If that isn’t the case, practice maturity by being organized, disciplined, and rational in your decision making.Of course, there’s only so much you can do as maturity comes with age, but consciously working towards being mature rather than childlike will definitely make you stand out from other freshmen.  , Not only will learning about healthy relationships help you know what to expect, but it will also make you more confident and self-assured. After all, if you are trying to attract a senior, you should know the fundamentals of healthy relationships instead of always looking to them for guidance as this will create an unequal power dynamic. Finally, understanding and practicing healthy relationship skills will set you up for safe and fulfilling relationships down the road.   Good communication and mutual respect are perhaps the two most crucial aspects of any healthy relationship. When talking to your crush, be honest about yourself and practice good listening skills. Also be sure to respect them by being considerate of their time and feelings (and make sure they are reciprocating!). You’ll know if you are in a healthy relationship if you feel good about yourself and energized when spending time with that person. Unhealthy relationships tend to be emotionally unfulfilling, draining, and negative so make sure to watch for how you feel when spending time with your crush as that will clue you into whether the relationship is actually healthy or not.","['age', 'boundaries', 'hobbies', 'differences', 'laws', 'crush', 'consent', 'healthy relationship skills', 'background', 'age matters']"

You may also see advertisements for craft fairs around town. Keep your eyes peeled and try to find a craft fair that meets your needs.Oftentimes, organizations plan craft fairs to raise money. If you want your money to go to a worthwhile cause, see if local charities, churches, and schools are planning any craft fairs. You should also look online and in the newspaper. Try to find craft fairs catered specifically to your needs. Some craft fairs may, for example, be selling items specifically for young children. This can be great if you have kids.; , As with any other shopping trip, a list is important. This will keep you focused and prevent overspending. If you have some idea what you want to get for various family members, jot down a list and take it with you to the craft fair.You may not know exactly what you're getting someone, and you won't always what precise items will be offered at a craft fair. However, you can write down a general idea. For example, if your mom loves decorative soaps, you can write down ""soap/bathroom items"" near her name. If you want to let the craft fair inspire you, simply write down the name of everyone who needs a gift. You can then try to find a gift that suits everyone on your list when you get to the fair.  , This can be a great way to prevent overspending. You don't want to go into a craft fair spending too much money, so have a sense of how much you can reasonably spend.Write down your income for the month. Add up any necessary expenses, like bills, rent, and groceries, and then subtract this from your total income. This is your spending money for the month. Think about how much of your spending money you can reasonably put towards the craft fair. Maybe you can put around $200 towards Christmas presents this year. Try to break down your budget from there. If you're buying gifts for five people, for example, a $200 budget would allow you to spend roughly $40 per person.  , Most vendors at craft fairs will not be able to accept credit and debit cards. In addition to this, cash can prevent you from overspending. If you take out exactly how much money you budgeted to spend, you can easily keep track of your spending. This will prevent you from overspending at a holiday craft fair.Make sure to store your cash safely in your wallet or purse. You do not want your money to get lost or stolen at the fair.  , The fact is, some people are simply easier to shop for than others. Casual acquaintances like co-workers, for example, will require less thoughtful gifts than close friends and family members. In order to streamline your shopping experience, get the easier, cheaper gifts done first.Oftentimes, the easiest gifts are things like stocking stuffers. You may, for example, be picking up a few ornaments to send to your distant cousins. You can quickly grab these at a booth and then focus on the more complicated gifts. Easy gifts are not always for people you are not close to, however. You may have a friend or family member who's simply easier to buy for. If you know your dad will love some homemade mustard and salsa, for example, stop by a food booth and pick this up first. This gets one item off your list right away.  , If you're unsure what to get someone, be creative. Think about an item that person would reasonably use. People often end up with an assortment of knick-knacks and things they will not use after the holiday season. Many people would greatly appreciate a practical item.If you're struggling to figure out a gift for someone, think about something they're doing or planning. For example, maybe your brother and his wife take a skiing trip every year for New Years. Get your brother and his wife items they can use on their trip. You can, for example, get your brother and his wife a set of matching hand-knit scarves.  , Oftentimes, people sell homemade food at craft fairs. Many people appreciate a tasty treat for the holiday season. See if the holiday craft fair has any booths selling food.Make sure to watch the expiration date on food-based items. Go for items that will last a few weeks so they won't go bad before the holiday season.  , Many craft fairs sell supplies for crafting itself. You may find a booth selling fabric, knitting supplies, or other craft supplies. If you're creative yourself, or know someone who is, buy some crafting supplies.You can buy someone who does crafts supplies for a project. An avid knitter, for example, may love some new yarn. You can also buy supplies to make something yourself. You can ask the person behind the booth for advice, as anyone selling items at a craft fair knows a lot about crafting themselves.  , Craft fairs tend to sell food and drinks in addition to crafts. If you're shopping for a long time, you're likely to get hungry. However, spending money on food is likely to eat into your shopping budget. Eat ahead of time at home instead of buying food at a craft fair., Craft fairs can often get crowded. If it works in your schedule, opt to arrive early. You will be able to get items before other shoppers and won't have to deal with navigating a crowd., The longer you shop, the more likely you are to overspend. If you give yourself a full day at a craft fair, you're more vulnerable to impulsive purchasing decisions. Give yourself a strict time limit before leaving for the fair.For example, you can plan on staying at the fair for 2 hours. Set a timer on your phone and keep an eye on the time as you're shopping. If you're the type to linger while shopping, make plans that will force you to leave the fair. For example, plan to get dinner with a friend a couple of hours after you arrive at the fair.  , Clothing can be a great gift, but clothing sizes are often difficult to determine. Also, even if something fits, someone may dislike the way it looks on them. In general, unless you're sure of someone's size and style, it's best to avoid clothing as a present.","['food', 'strict time limit', 'someone clothes', 'time', 'budget', 'easy gifts', 'gifts people', 'local craft fairs', 'cash', 'craft supplies', 'list']"

One approach is to download a ""USB Driver Tool"" and the ""USB Device Drivers"" from Hack the RAZR's site. For the latest version, download Motorola's EU Driver Installation from their developer's site. You will need to create a free account to get to this download page if you don't directly follow the link above.; , For Motorola's official driver release, the extracted file is ""Motorola_EU_Driver_Installation_v?.?.?.msi"" (question marks represent digits of the version number), and for third party distributions, the extracted files should include eight .inf files and one .sys file.  , None of the v3m drivers are Microsoft-certified, so be sure you've obtained them from a reliable source before you continue.    Recommended install. This requires the official Motorola drivers from their developer site:  Launch the installer by double-clicking on the ""Motorola_EU_Driver_Installation_v?.?.?.msi"" file (question marks represent version number placeholders).  1st window: click the ""Next"" button.  2nd window: select the ""I Agree"" radio button if you agree to the license shown in the window, then click the ""Next"" button.  3rd window: click the ""Close"" button.  Connect your RAZR. Find a ""Type A"" USB to ""Type B"" Mini-USB cable. Connect the USB end to your PC, and the Mini-USB end to your RAZR.

The PST software is intellectual property of Motorola, so no additional help or screen shots may be provided for obtaining the software.  , The p2k Seem Editor is a tool that provides a direct means of manually changing bits of a mobile device's settings. The program only needs be extracted from its archive to function, as it has no installer to run. Originally found on HowardForums.com years ago, the original author and/or distributors have left no information to track the application's version or contributor history. Fortunately, the application is quite stable and reliable in its currently distributed form. Distributions of the application contain a Functions.csv file that assigns comments to specific seem bits, a hexedit.dll file, usually a readme.txt or .nfo file, and the p2kseem.exe program file.  , The Seem Editor is sectioned into three main interface groupings: the seem location, hexadecimal grid, and bit switches. To use the seem editor, values are manually entered into the seem location area in the bottom right corner of the window. This will provide search criteria when the ""Load from phone"" button is clicked. Upon a successful read, hexadecimal data will appear in the top left corner of the window. Clicking on any byte will show the appropriate data in the bit switching area at the bottom left corner of the window.   Load the p2k Seem Editor. Enter 2742 into the ""Seem"" text box of the ""Load"" group. Leave the ""Record"" text box of the ""Load"" group at the default value of 1 or 0001. Enter 0000 into the ""Bytes (h)"" text box. Click on the ""Load from phone"" button. Rows of hexadecimal values should appear in the upper left corner. If you received a connection error, close the Seem Editor and reset the connection with PST by creating a new phone book, then load phone's data into the new phone book. Locate the row designed by the number 000060. Click on the 11th column of dual digit hexadecimal values on this row. The ""Offset"" will read 006a in the ""Selected byte details"" group. Alternatively, click on the first column of row 000060 and use your keyboard's arrow keys to navigate right until ""Offset"" reads 006a. ""Bit 0"" in the ""Selected byte details"" group should have a comment next to it: ""Bluetooth Or USB file transfer..."". Put a check next to ""Bit 0"" (comment's suffix will change to ""on""), and a check next to ""Bit 1"". Double-check your bit changes and an offset value still showing 006a. Verify that the ""Save"" group and ""Load"" group check boxes' values match. Ignore the text alignment of the text box contents. Click on the ""Save to phone"" button. Click on the ""Yes"" button. Change is complete. Unplug your phone from the USB connection and power cycle it for the changes to take effect. Search for other seem edits online to change settings that would otherwise be unavailable in Verizon's modified RAZR operating system.  , Popular file transfer utilities include Mobile Phone Tools, BitPim, and P2k Commander. Find one that works best for your tastes. None of these applications are perfect, but each offers a different twist of functionality. P2k Commander is often touted as the easiest and most straight-forward of p2k-based file transfer utilities, even though it is full of bugs and coded with poor error handling. P2k Commander is authored by an individual from Hungary, with contributors from all over the world. As of this writing, the current version is 4.9.E. Once you're comfortable with one, you should be able to browse, copy, and delete files, as well as view individual file and storage information.  , Now you'll be empowered to use all of your RAZR's features.

Watch live performances of professional choirs and focus on what the director does and how the singers respond to each signal. Go to live choir performances and watch the director. Be sure you choose a seat that enables a clear view of the director. Take notes about what seems to work especially well. Sit in on a choir rehearsal and watch the director from the singers’ points of view.; , Writing down the signals that you plan to use will lead to more consistency when used.  , Most signals must be exaggerated for your singers to see them clearly—particularly with a large choir or with children. However, try not to exaggerate so much that the audience would be distracted by your movements.  , Direct in front of a mirror or videotape yourself directing and determine whether your signals are clear.  , The more you practice using your directing body language, the more comfortable you will be doing it in front of an actual choir.   Play your favorite choral music and pretend that you are directing it. If you know another choir director, ask if you can “borrow” their (already trained) choir for a part of a rehearsal. Then ask for feedback or tips from the singers or the choir director.  , While holding auditions may lead to a more skilled choir, some choir directors choose to give all those interested an opportunity to participate.  , If you decide to have auditions, be sure to do the following steps. If you do not plan to hold auditions, you can skip ahead to the next part.   Secure a time and place for your auditions. For consistency It may be best to hold auditions in the room you in which you will be rehearsing or performing. Advertise your auditions. Think about the types of singers you wish to recruit and plan your advertising accordingly. You may want to start advertising several weeks to a month before the auditions will take place. Decide whether to have singers prepare their own piece of music for the audition or sight-read on the spot. This information should be included in the advertisement.  , Listening to each vocalist sing and taking thorough notes about their performance will help you in your selection process.   Evaluate the vocal ability of each singer by noting the range and quality of each voice. You may want to develop a short questionnaire for singers to disclose experience, describe vocal range, ability to read music, etc. Maintain a neutral facial expression during each singer's tryout and be sure to remain professional and polite. Someone's feelings may be hurt by a frown or other reaction to a poor performance, or you may get up someone’s hope by seeming excessively pleased.  , Determine the number of singers you need, as well as the voice mix you desire then select those singers required.   If you have very experienced, strong singers, you can form a small group, whereas less skilled singers do better in a large group. Ensure that you have the appropriate balance in vocal parts: soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. You may make other balance considerations as well. Be sure to consider other aspects such as gender, age, and race to maintain diversity.  , You will need to notify those who auditioned whether or not they were chosen for the choir by writing a letter or posting a list or phoning.   Be sure to write a short note of thanks to those who were not selected.  , There are many considerations that influence music selection: Is the choir religious or secular? What season is it? If the choir is performing as a part of a larger event, what is the tone of the event? , Music selections should be based on the skill level of your choir, and should be easy enough that they can be successful but complex enough that they will be challenged. , You may want to find music that is in the public domain if you do not have a budget for royalties. , It is important that you know how you want the music to sound before you begin working with pieces with the choir. Meet with the accompanist to discuss the music and your interpretation of it. Become very familiar with the music, including all of the individual vocal parts, and how you will conduct it before going into rehearsal. Do not try to ""learn it as you go.""  , The plan should include an attendance policy with repercussions for missing practices.   Include date, time, and place for each rehearsal. Your accompanist should be at all of your rehearsals. If your chorus is a cappella or if you are using pre-recorded accompanying music, you do not need an accompanist.  ,   When introducing new music, be sure to discuss in detail the musical piece you have chosen. Break each piece up into manageable sections. You do not need to work an entire piece in one rehearsal. Be consistent with the format of your rehearsals. Start with a warm-up, then move to the sections that are to be rehearsed. Be clear about your goals for each rehearsal.  , Working with individuals or small groups can be as important as rehearsing with the entire choir.   Work with soloists to perfect each's part to make their performance more polished. During sectional rehearsals, split the choir into individual voice parts and rehearse each part separately. This way, more time may be devoted to ensuring that notes and rhythms are mastered. Reassemble the sections and soloists back together as an ensemble after you are satisfied with their work in sectionals.  , All of the members of your choir should have coordinated outfits that do not distract from their performance and that look professional.   Church choirs may already have choir robes. Be sure to communicate with the church organizers about choir expectations. Other types of choir groups, such as school or community choirs, may not have preexisting uniforms, but may wear white shirts with black pants or skirts.  , While secondary to singing, skills such as taking a bow together at the end (if applicable) or sitting and standing in unison can make the difference between an amateur and professional looking performance.  , Be sure to include detail such as time, date, and place of performance, featured singers, and hosting organization. Include ticket prices or suggested donation if applicable.  , Warming up will ensure that your choir is ready to sing, and you can be sure that everyone is present.   Try not to introduce any new information before a performance; instead, try to “fine tune” things that you have already worked on. Give a few last-minute reminders if necessary, but try not to overwhelm your choir with different things to remember.  , Be sure to communicate with the director of the event about how and when to begin the performance, as well as where the choir should sit or stand both before and during the choral performance.   While directing, be consistent. Use the cues, hand gestures, and facial expressions that you used during rehearsals.  , Save any constructive criticism for the next rehearsal: tonight, let them shine!

The cage should be at least 7.5 square feet. If you purchased pups from the pet store, make sure that the cage is large enough before you leave the store.Even though the cage may seem a bit big for your pups, they will appreciate the extra space they will have to run and explore their environment. If you have a mother guinea pig in a cage with her babies, the cage should be large enough (minimum of 8 square feet) to accommodate all of them through the nursing stage.If your current cage is not large enough, visit your local pet store for assistance in selecting the right size cage.; , The majority of guinea pig cages are built for adult guinea pigs.For example, there is usually one-inch spacing between the bars on a guinea pig cage. Your pups could possibly be small enough to squeeze through this spacing. To prevent them from doing this, consider purchasing a cage that has a deeper pan at the bottom. The deeper pan would be more difficult for your pups to climb out of.As an alternative to buying a new cage, you can purchase grids with smaller spacing at your local pet store. Secure the grids on the outside of the cage with cable ties., The water bottle should be positioned low enough so that your pups can comfortably reach and sip from the bottle’s sipper tube.You may need to reposition the water bottle several times before it’s at just the right height for them. These water bottles can be purchased at your local pet store.   The lowered water bottle may too low for your pups' mom. If you see that she is struggling to sip from the water bottle, it may be helpful to place a second water bottle at a higher height for her.  , This is important whether you are bringing home pups or caring for the ones that your female guinea pig has given birth to. Guinea pigs can be very sensitive to noise,so your pups will need to stay in a quiet area during their first few weeks of life.   The cage should also be out of the path of direct sunlight and placed away from vents that could constantly blow air on the cage.It is ideal for the cage to be placed at approximately waist-level. This can make it easier to clean., Pups should be held as early and often as possible so that they can become comfortable with human interaction. The more comfortable they are with people, the better socialized they will be, making them better pets. The mother guinea pig will not reject her babies if you hold them, but she will need time to complete the birthing process before they are ready to be held.Female guinea pigs typically give birth to an average of three pups per litter. The birthing process usually takes about 30 minutes, with about three to five minutes between pups. You will know when the process is over when all pups have been delivered and the mother has eaten the placenta and cleaned the pups.In general, guinea pigs are not used to being held and may initially feel afraid when you pick them up. Getting your pups to be comfortable with you holding them may take some time.To pick up one of your pups, slowly reach into the cage and reach for him from the front. Slide one of your hands under his chest and use your other hand to support his back end. Slowly pick him up and hold him against your chest for as long as he will let you. Talk to him with a gentle voice as you are handling him.If the pup becomes squirmy when you are holding him, gently lower him back into his cage.Your pup may start to squeak when you take him away from his mom to hold him. Make sure not to keep him away from his mother for long.Do not try to handle your pups when they are sleeping or nursing.  , If you purchased your pups from your local pet store, you probably will not need to determine whether they are male or female. If your adult female guinea pig gave birth, you can try to determine the sex of the babies soon after they are born. Female guinea pigs will have what looks like a tiny grain of rice in their genital area. Male guinea pigs will have a white ring in this area.It is recommended to have your veterinarian or a guinea pig expert determine the sex of your pups,if this has not already been done at the pet store.  , If necessary, the male pups should be separated from their sisters and mother and moved to a different cage at the time of sexual maturity, which is around three to four weeks of age.This separation is necessary to prevent accidental pregnancies.Ideally, males should be moved to a different cage around three weeks of age. Female pups can stay with their mother until four weeks of age.Guinea pigs are usually ready to begin leading more independent lives when they are around six weeks old,but you should still aim to separate them by three to four weeks of age if necessary.  , Pups generally eat the same thing as adult guinea pigs, so you do not need to feed a specific baby diet. One exception is that pups need additional calcium in their first few weeks of life. The extra calcium will help their bones grow properly.Alfalfa hay is especially high in calcium.Alfalfa-based pellets are also available.Timothy hay and fresh fruits (oranges, melons) are high in vitamin C and are nutritious foods that you can feed your pups., Feed your pups twice a day by placing small amounts of food in a sturdy food bowl. Remove any leftover food so that it does not spoil.Pups also need a constant supply of fresh water. Refill the plastic water bottle as needed and clean it with hot, soapy water once a week.If the pups are still with their mother, they will start nursing within about 24 hours of birth and will continue nursing for about three weeks (before they reach sexual maturity). They will nurse from their mother during the first few days of life, then transition to solid food and mimic how their mother eats., Guinea pigs are susceptible to many types of diseases, such as heat stress, foot pad infections, and pneumonia. Because pups need a lot of vitamin C in their diet, a deficiency of this vitamin can cause a disease called scurvy. Signs of scurvy include swollen and painful joints, lack of appetite, and a reluctance to move.If your pups are showing signs of scurvy, take them to the veterinarian for immediate treatment. Depending on the severity of the deficiency, your veterinarian may need to give your pups vitamin C injections., The ideal bedding for your pups' cage consists of several inches of shredded newspaper or pine shed bedding. This bedding can quickly become soiled with leftover food and dropping. It may also become wet with drops of water from the water bottle. Change this bedding twice a week to keep the cage clean., Just like adult guinea pigs, pups love to play. Toys that your pup would enjoy include tunnels and ramps (if your cage is multi-level). Toys can be purchased at your local pet store, or you can make homemade toys out of such items as empty shoeboxes, empty milk cartons, and toilet paper rolls.   You can also let your pups play outside of their cage. You will need to guinea pig-proof a room first to make the play area as safe as possible.

"['evaluate the professionalism of production', 'research the author', 'check the date', 'investigate the publisher', 'determine the intended audience', 'check the reviews', ""evaluate the source's sources"", 'identify bias', 'evaluate consistency', 'investigate the financial or funding sources for sponsored research']",How to Evaluate the Credibility of a Source3," Generally, the more time and money that is invested into the creation and publishing of the material, the more likely you are to find reliable information. A poorly designed website or pamphlet, or a site that is covered in unsightly advertisements and pop-ups, is not likely to provide information from an individual or organization invested in preserving their reputation or image.   Look for high-end, professional finishes to websites and print publications. Note that this does not mean that all information found in well-packaged sources is credible. Templates for well-designed websites are inexpensive and easily available.  , A source is more credible if written by someone with a degree or other credentials in the subject of interest. If no author or organization is named, the source should not be considered highly credible. However, if the author is presenting original work, evaluate the merit of the ideas, not the credentials. Credentials have never guaranteed innovation and the history of science tells us that the big advances in sciences tend to come from outsiders, not the establishment. Some questions that you should ask about the author are:Where does the author work? If the author is affiliated with a reputable institution or organization, what are its values and goals? Do they benefit financially by promoting a particular view? What is his or her educational background? What other works has the author published? What experience does the author have? Is s/he an innovator, or a follower and promoter of the status quo? Has this author been cited as a source by other scholars or experts in the field? In the case of an anonymous author, you can check who published the website with http://whois.domaintools.com. It will tell you who registered the domain name and when, how many other domains they have, an email address to reach the person or organization as well as the mailing address.  , Find out when the source was published or revised. In some subject areas, such as the sciences, having current sources is essential; but in other fields, like the humanities, including older material is critical. It's also possible that you're looking at an older version of the source, and an updated one has since been published. Check with a scholarly database for academic sources (or an online bookstore for popular sources) to see if a more recent version is available. If so, not only should you find it, but you can also feel more confident about the source — the more printings or editions, the more reliable the information.  , The institution housing the information can often tell you a great deal about how credible that information is. For example, you should feel more comfortable trusting information found in The New York Times or The Washington Post — two newspapers with proven track records of journalistic integrity and public retraction of errors — than that found in a source like Infowars, which has a wide readership, but often publishes misleading or blatantly incorrect information., Scan the document in question for tone, depth, and breadth before absorbing the information in it. Are those three elements appropriate for your project?Using a source that is too specialized and technical for your needs may lead you to misinterpret the information given, which is just as hurtful to your own credibility as using an unreliable source.  , You should make use of resources like Book Review Index, Book Review Digest, and Periodical Abstracts to determine how and why others have criticized the source. If there is significant controversy surrounding the validity of the source, you may wish to avoid using it, or examine it further with a skeptical eye.  , Citing other reliable sources is a sign of credibility. It is, however, sometimes necessary to verify that the other sources also show a pattern of credibility and are used in context.  , If the source's author is known to be emotionally or financially connected with the subject, be aware that the source may not fairly represent all views. Sometimes research is necessary to determine relationships that indicate the possibility of bias; look up the author and the publishing institution to see if they have been accused of biased work in the past.   Be conscious of wording that indicates judgment. Conclusions that describe something as ""bad or good"" or ""right or wrong"" should be examined critically. It is more appropriate to compare something to an objective standard than to label it with words that represent abstract concepts — for example, ""...these and other illegal acts..."" is preferable to ""...these and other despicable acts..."" The former describes the acts in terms of the law (an objective source, somewhat) whereas the first example judges the actions according to the author's own belief of what is a despicable act.  , Sources that apply different standards to those who agree and disagree with them are suspect. If your source praises one politician for ""changing to meet the needs of his constituency"" but criticizes an opposing politician for ""changing his position with opinion polls,"" then it is likely that the source is biased.  , Determine the sources of funding for the work to get an idea of the potential influences on it. Various sources of funding can sway the information presented or the way a study is conducted in order to align with their own agendas.   For example, the BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) banned all tobacco research funded by tobacco companies in 2013 because they determined that the special interests of the research funders would lead to biased, unreliable conclusions.","['reviews', 'consistency', 'sources', 'bias', 'date', 'research', 'publisher', 'source', 'author', 'intended audience', 'production', 'funding sources', 'professionalism']"

In the complaint, the plaintiff will allege the protected characteristic you discriminated against, as well as the credit transaction in which you discriminated. You should read the complaint closely.   Also pay attention to the summons, which should come with the complaint. The summons will tell you when you must respond to the lawsuit.; , You should read the complaint in particular to discover what protected characteristic the plaintiff claims you discriminated against. Consumers are protected from discrimination based on the following protected characteristics:race or color national origin religion disability (home loans only) age (not applicable to home loans) sex or marital status receipt of public assistance income (not applicable to home loans) exercising rights in good faith under the Consumer Credit Protection Act  , Also read the complaint to see what transaction the plaintiff claims he or she was the basis of the discrimination. For example, consumers can claim to have been discriminated against in the following ways:you refused credit or a home loan to someone who qualified you discouraged someone from applying for credit you offered credit on less favorable terms, such as a higher interest rate, than to someone with similar qualifications you closed someone’s account or treated them unfairly in collections upon default or in loan servicing  , As soon as you receive the complaint, you should contact a lawyer. If you work in a large company (like a bank or mortgage company), then you should have general counsel on the payroll. If you work for a smaller business, you may already have an attorney on retainer. Ask a supervisor for the name of your lawyer.   If your business does not have a lawyer, then you will need to find one. You should ask other creditors in your area who their attorney is and if they would recommend the lawyer or law firm. If you have no leads, then you can contact any industry organizations that you belong to and seek a referral.  , You should find all documents that relate to the discrimination claim. For example, if the plaintiff claims you discriminated during a loan application process, then you would want to gather all information that relates to the application: the application itself, any notes made during the interview, email communications about the consumer, etc.   Find all documents and put them in some sort of logical order to show to your attorney. Also gather examples of company policies. A discrimination lawsuit will turn on your actions. Since you are unlikely to admit at trial that you illegally discriminated against someone, discrimination will have to be based on your conduct. If you deviated from your company’s policies, then there is some proof that you might have been motivated by a discriminatory purpose.  , Your lawyer will review the information in order to come up with defenses. The specific defenses you raise will depend on the unique circumstances of your case. Typically, however, you will argue that the adverse credit action was taken for non-discriminatory reasons.   For example, the applicant may have had bad credit and wouldn’t have qualified for credit anyways. In that situation, you can argue that you didn’t take into consideration the plaintiff’s protected characteristic, such as race or national origin. The applicant may have been a credit risk for another reason, e.g., a spotty work history or an income that is too low for the amount of credit requested. The applicant could have lied on the application. For example, the applicant might have claimed greater income than you could verify. You can also argue that you were never aware of the protected characteristic when you declined the loan. For example, you might have rejected an application without ever meeting with the applicant. In this situation, you can argue that there was no way you could have known someone’s national origin, religion, or race.  , Your lawyer will respond to the complaint by filing an answer. In the answer, you admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny each allegation.   You then file the answer with the court and serve a copy on the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s lawyer., After you have filed an answer, both parties will engage in fact-finding, called “discovery.” In addition to turning over documents, you can depose witnesses by asking them questions face-to-face, which they must answer under oath. As the defendant in a credit discrimination case, you can expect to be deposed. To prepare, remember the following:Get a good night’s sleep beforehand. Depositions can be long and exhausting. The more rested you are when you walk in for the deposition, the better. Dress professionally. Wear a suit, if possible. Avoid showing anger or annoyance. If you need to take a break, then ask your lawyer if you can break. Don’t guess. If you don’t remember or don’t know the answer to a question, then say so. Take as much time as necessary to answer.  , After you and the plaintiff trade documents and give depositions, your lawyer can file a summary judgment motion. In this motion, you argue that you are entitled to judgment as a matter of law because no issues of material fact are in dispute.It might be difficult to win a summary judgment motion in a discrimination case, because so much depends on what you were thinking when you took the adverse credit action. However, your attorney might consider bringing the motion in any event, particularly where there is little objective evidence of discrimination (such as discriminatory comments).  , Your lawyer will handle the nuts and bolts of the trial: selecting a jury, delivering opening and closing statements, and examining witnesses. You may or may not be the company representative chosen to attend the trial on a daily basis.   If you do attend, then make sure to stay engaged. Trials can be boring, but you can stay engaged if you take notes. You can sit with your lawyer at the defense table and ask the lawyer questions as well. If for some reason your company cannot afford a lawyer, then see Represent Yourself in Court (U.S.) for advice.  , If you had to give a deposition, then you will probably have to testify at trial. Testifying at trial is similar to a deposition, so you should follow the same advice. Remember the following additional tips:Sit up straight on the witness stand and look at the attorney who is asking a question. When you answer, turn toward the jury and make eye contact with the jurors. Answer simply and honestly. Don’t try to hide information from the lawyer. The lawyer will get it out of you anyway. Speak loudly and confidently. Also answer in whole words. Don’t mumble or answer with gestures (such as shrugging). Listen carefully to the question and answer only the questioned ask. Although you shouldn’t be evasive in your answers, you also do not need to volunteer information.  , If you have a jury trial, then the jury will retire at the close of evidence to deliberate. If you took a bench trial, then the judge may deliver a verdict immediately or take the issue under advisement. In the second situation, the judge may not issue a written decision for several months. Your lawyer will be notified when a decision has been reached.   If you lose at trial, then your company will need to decide whether to appeal the decision. There are many factors to consider when deciding whether to appeal: the strength of your case, whether the judge made an obvious legal error, and how much money the plaintiff was awarded. Discuss these factors with your lawyer soon after trial. If you want to appeal, then you generally have a very short amount of time (10-30 days, usually) to fill out a Notice of Appeal form and file it with the court.  , In order to avoid future lawsuits for credit discrimination, you should make sure that employees are trained in the relevant law. Federal law limits the kinds of questions employees can ask. For example, you can’t ask about an applicant’s spouse or former spouse except in certain narrow circumstances.Your lawyer can provide training programs for appropriate staff and can help you draft employee manuals or handbooks which lay out the relevant federal requirements.  , Employees also need to properly document why they approve or reject someone for credit. You are vulnerable to a lawsuit where you do not properly document decision-making.   Make sure all reasons for rejecting an applicant are put down on paper. Also make sure that papers are properly dated so that someone can tell when the decision to extend or deny credit was made. You also need to make sure that you notify applicants whether they have been approved or denied credit in writing. Federal law will spell out what must be in the notice.You should hire a lawyer to draft form notices for your company.  , If you give consumers a way to complain about how they have been treated, then you might be able to pre-empt a lawsuit. You should set up a hotline that consumers can call.   Be sure to print the complaint hotline on your marketing materials, so that consumers can find the number quite easily.

"['freeze ripe', 'firm strawberries', 'cut off the inedible green material', 'decide how to prepare your strawberries before freezing', 'add sugar or sugar syrup (optional)', 'consider pectin syrup instead (optional)', 'place the strawberries in freezer-safe containers', 'partially thaw strawberries before using']",How to Keep Strawberries Fresh2," Once a strawberry has started to decay or turn mushy, freezing won't save it. The ripe, bright red strawberries will preserve best.Moldy or mushy strawberries should be discarded in the compost, garden, or trash.  , Most strawberries are sold with a green cap where the stem was attached, or with a small stem segment. Cut these off before freezing.  , You can freeze strawberries whole, but if you intend to use them in recipes or as toppings you may wish to chop, slice, crush, or puree them first. Once frozen and thawed, they will be more difficult to cut, although pureeing always remains an option. Larger strawberries may also freeze and thaw more evenly if you cut them into smaller pieces first.If you're not sure how you want to prepare your strawberries, look at a few recipes first. Pureed strawberries work well in slushies or smoothies, while sliced ones go well as toppings on cakes or waffles. Whole strawberries can be dipped in chocolate.        , Packing strawberries in sugar or sugar syrup will preserve more flavor and texture, but not everyone enjoys the extreme sweetness that can result.If you do decide to go this route, use 3/4 cup (180 mL) sugar for each 1 quart (1 L) berries, regardless of how they are prepared. Alternatively, create a heavy sugar syrup by mixing equal parts sugar and lukewarm water, then chill in the refrigerator and use it to cover the berries completely.While it may make more sense to add sugar or syrup after packing the strawberries, decide whether to use it or not before you begin packing, so you know whether to leave additional space in the containers.  , This is a good option if you prefer an unsweetened strawberry, but you want to preserve the flavor and texture better than a ""dry pack"" with no additional ingredients would. This requires purchasing powdered pectin, and boiling it in water. Different brands may require different amounts of water per packet. Let the pectin syrup cool before covering the strawberries.   Note that this may not preserve it as well as the sugar or sugar syrup.        , Thick, rigid glass and plastic containers typically work best, but make sure they are freezer-safe before using. Freezer-safe plastic zip lock bags are another option. Pack the strawberries loosely to prevent them forming one large mass. It's generally a good idea to leave 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25–2 cm) of space at the top of the container to allow for expansion while freezing.   If the strawberries are packed ""dry,"" without any sugar or syrups, you may wish to spread them loosely on a tray and freeze them for a few hours on the tray. Then transfer to a more compact container as described. This makes it easier to remove individual strawberries instead of a large, icy lump.  , Remove the strawberries and let thaw in the refrigerator for several hours before using. If you wish to speed up this process, put the strawberries under cold running water. Heating in a microwave or by another method may cause the strawberries to become unpleasantly mushy. Eat while there are still a few ice crystals on the surface, as the strawberries may become mushy when fully thawed.  The exact length of time this process takes depends on the temperature and the size of your strawberries. A large mass of strawberries frozen together may need to be left overnight or even longer.

Before you begin the application process, confirm a new EIN is necessary and find out what information will be required to complete the application.Generally, as executor of the estate, you must get a new EIN for a business that was run by the deceased person as a sole proprietorship. However, if the deceased person did not previously have an EIN for the business, it may not be necessary for you to get one now. Sole proprietorships are not considered distinct from the person for tax purposes, so it's possible that a sole proprietor simply used their own Social Security number for business dealings. For example, if the deceased person worked as a freelance graphic designer from their own home, they may have used their own Social Security number for contracts with clients rather than keeping the business separate. As a general rule, if there was an EIN for the business while the person was alive, you need a new one to properly deal with the business and its assets after the person's death.; , The online EIN application is set up interview-style, where you are asked questions and supply the answers before moving on to the next item. This application format typically is easier and more straightforward than filling out the paper form.The online application is available Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern time. If you want, you do have the option of applying for an EIN by completing Form SS-4 and faxing or mailing it to the IRS. However, this method is slightly more difficult and you'll have to wait for the new EIN. You must provide information about the business – which you should be able to gather from the deceased person's records – as well as personal information about yourself as the responsible person for the new EIN.  , Once you've submitted your application, you will immediately be issued the new EIN for the business. While you have the option to download and save an electronic copy of the notice, you also should print a paper copy for the estate's records.Keep the EIN in a safe place as you will need to use it to update business records and information when you dissolve the business or distribute it according to the requirements of the will. While it may take a few days for the new EIN to show up in the IRS's taxpayer records, you should still be able to use it in the meantime for other tasks such as opening a bank account.  , If the deceased person's business is mentioned in the will, you must follow the instructions there regarding what is to be done with the business. However, a sole proprietorship typically dies with the business owner.It is part of your fiduciary duties as the executor or personal representative of the estate to do everything in your power to ensure that assets are distributed according to the deceased person's intentions. If the deceased person has indicated that they want the business as a whole to pass onto a beneficiary such as their child, contact that beneficiary as soon as possible and find out what they want to do with the business before you start dissolving it and liquidating assets. You may have to go to the probate court to get permission to continue to operate the business if the will passes the business to a beneficiary in its entirety.  , While as executor you must provide an inventory for the estate as a whole, you should make a separate inventory for the business and keep those assets apart from the personal assets of the deceased person.You can use the same form to inventory business assets as you used to inventory the deceased person's personal assets. You don't need to inventory every item individually, but you do need to categorize items and provide a general estimate of the value of all items included in that category. If the business has perishable items, these need to be sold off or disposed of as quickly as possible rather than left to rot. This is a particular concern if the deceased person owned a restaurant or similar business.  , Particularly if the deceased person owned a brick-and-mortar store, or met with clients, they typically would have had to register their business with the state and local government.Check the website of the state's secretary of state website for information on dissolving a sole proprietorship, and to find out who you need to notify. Although the requirements for dissolving a sole proprietorship are considerably less formal than those for dissolving a corporation or LLC, at a minimum you typically must notify the business licensing and taxing authority so the business is no longer charged taxes or registration fees.  , If the business was required to maintain any permits or licenses to operate, you must contact the agencies that issue and regulate those licenses or permits and let them know the business is being dissolved.Failing to cancel a permit or license could result in the estate being charged significant taxes or penalties if fees aren't paid or reports aren't filed when due. Particularly if you've decided to liquidate the business, you don't want the business to continue to be subject to various regulations or requirements that are conditions of maintaining a valid license. You may have to show your court certificate to the agencies that issued the permits or licenses to prove that you have authority to cancel them. You also may need to show a death certificate.  , Even with a sole proprietorship, the deceased person may have registered a fictitious business name, or ""DBA"" (which stands for ""doing business as"") with the state.The county clerk should have a form you can complete to file an ""abandonment"" notice in the local newspaper. The state's secretary of state typically maintains the registered name database. You typically can contact that office and ask them to remove the deceased person's DBA from the database. You may have to fill out a form or provide documentation certifying you as executor of the deceased person's estate.  , As executor, you will need to set up a separate bank account for the estate to manage business assets and make payments to business creditors.Although you may have already set up a bank account for the estate as a whole, a separate account for the business keeps the assets separate. Keeping assets separate is particularly advised if the deceased person generally maintained a separation between business and personal finances and had a separate bank account for the business.  , Any creditors that loaned the deceased person money specifically for the business must be notified using the same procedures by which you notified that person's personal creditors.You'll have to review the deceased person's business accounts to identify creditors. For those you find, notify them directly using the probate court form that you used to notify the personal creditors. Typically you must send these notices using certified mail with returned receipt requested. Once you get the green card back, keep it in the estate's files for the business. The probate court gives creditors a limited period of time to file a claim if they want to collect money from the estate. When a creditor files a claim, you'll have the opportunity to review it and determine whether you will accept it or dispute the validity of the debt and require more information.  , If the business has an open commercial lease for store or office space, you must notify the landlord and terminate that lease according to its provisions. Any open contracts, such as those with suppliers or vendors, also must be terminated.Find the appropriate parties by going through the deceased person's business files, and contact them as soon as possible to notify them of the situation. Landlords or others may require a copy of the death certificate before they terminate the contract, so have those ready. Leases and contracts almost always include a clause that provides for immediate, no-fault termination upon the death of one of the parties. If the deceased person had any credit cards or other revolving lines of credit specific to the business, you'll want to close those as well. You probably want to notify any business insurers of the person's death as soon as possible, but don't terminate the insurance contracts until the business is liquidated and no longer operating. Otherwise the estate could face liability issues.  , If there isn't enough money to satisfy the business debts, you must sell the assets of the business to cover those amounts. Typically you would do this by holding a business liquidation sale.In a liquidation sale, inventory as well as fixtures and office furniture are sold. You can contract with a liquidator who specializes in running these sales. To sell some assets, you may need to first get the court's permission, depending on how the business was treated in the will. Particularly if the will passes the business as a whole to a beneficiary, it's part of your fiduciary duty to maintain that business as an asset for that beneficiary and keep it whole to the extent possible. In that situation, court permission may be required to liquidate the business. When the business is liquidated, the proceeds will be deposited in the estate business account to pay off the business creditors.  , Once the business is liquidated, you must pay all business creditors with accepted claims out of funds from the estate's business bank account. If there isn't enough money to cover the business debts, you'll have to work with the court to decide how they'll be paid.Each state has a hierarchy of creditors, and typically you'll just go down that list. However, keep in mind that sole proprietors are personally liable for the debts of their businesses. Since the business was a sole proprietorship, the court may order you to pay business creditors from the regular estate assets if there isn't enough money to cover the debts with business assets alone. If the business assets are enough to cover the business debts, any money remaining would either go to the beneficiary who was designated in the will to receive the business, or would be transferred into the general estate account. At that point, the business is dissolved, and you can close the business bank account.  , Since income for a sole proprietorship is reported on a regular individual income tax return, you'll typically need to complete the tax returns for the business when you complete the deceased person's final tax return.Keep in mind that this tax return covers income earned by the deceased person while they were still alive, not anything having to do with the dissolution of the business after their death. The tax return itself will be filed under the deceased person's Social Security number, not the new EIN you secured after their death. When you indicate the business's EIN on the tax returns, use the old EIN used by the deceased person, not the new one, since the income and expenses you're reporting were produced during that person's life. Small business taxes can be complicated. Hire a tax professional to assist you with this task so you can ensure that you've adequately fulfilled your fiduciary duty as executor by taking all deductions the person would have taken while alive. If the deceased person had an accountant or other tax professional who regularly completed and filed their business taxes, you may want to use that same person as they'll have familiarity with the business.

You can often apply at a local post office or governmental office. You will need an application form, birth certificate, and other forms of identification.   If you already have a passport, make sure it is not due to expire soon. Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date of your arrival in Egypt.If you have an official or diplomatic passport, you must obtain your visa before arriving in Egypt, even if you are traveling as a tourist.; , Your country’s government should provide current information on obtaining an Egyptian tourist visa and other entry requirements specific to travelers from your country of origin.   For example, if you are from the USA, visit the travel information website of the State Department and look for information on traveling to Egypt.The State Department website offers information on entry and exit requirements (including passport and visa requirements), current travel alerts and warnings, health information, information about local laws and customs, contact information for American embassies and consulates in Egypt, and a general description of the country.  , You may visit your embassy in person or apply by mail. Keep in mind that applications by mail will take additional time to process. In order to apply for a visa at your local embassy, you will need:A completed visa application (form available for download from most consulate/embassy websites). Two 2 inch x 2 inch (5.08 cm x 5.08 cm) current passport photos, against a white background. Your passport, which must be valid at least six months past your planned date of entry into Egypt. Two copies of your passport information page.  , Most consulates or embassies will accept only cash or cashier’s checks. Depending on your country of origin, tourist visa fees range from US $15-$30., Depending on your country of origin, you may need additional documentation, such as copies of your round-trip tickets or itinerary, or a letter from your school or employer. If you're a resident alien in the country from which you are traveling, you may need to provide a copy of your residency card., Travelers from some countries must obtain pre-approval before obtaining an Egyptian tourist visa. This process can take up to 6 weeks and must be completed before the visa can be processed. Consult your local Egyptian embassy or consulate to learn the proper procedure for getting pre-approval to obtain a visa.   Currently, pre-approval is required for citizens of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mali, Niger, Chad, Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, the Philippines, Lebanon (for travelers ages 16 to 50 years old), Morocco, Mauritania, Nigeria, Tunis, Bosnia (for travelers of Egyptian Origin), Congo, People’s Republic of China, Somalia, Algeria, Cyprus, Sudan, Kosovo, Libya (for men ages 16-60 years old), Pakistan, Moldova (for women ages 15 to 35 years old), Syria, Turkey (for travelers ages 18 to 45 years old), Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Yemen, and North Korea.","['egyptian consulate', 'advance', 'local government website', 'money', 'trip', 'local egyptian consulate', 'passport', 'information', 'tourist visa', 'embassy', 'visa application fee', 'additional documentation']"
"['define slope', 'visualize a line’s “rise over run.” the term “rise” refers to the vertical distance between two points', 'or the change in y{\\displaystyle y}', 'locate the slope of a line in an equation', 'assess the steepness of the line', 'identify a positive slope', 'identify a negative slope', 'understand the slope of a horizontal line', 'understand the slope of a vertical line']",How to Understand Slope (in Algebra)1," The slope is a measure of how steep a straight line is.A variety of branches of mathematics use slope. In geometry, you can use the slope to plot points on a line, including lines that define the shape of a polygon. Statisticians use slope to describe the correlation between two variables.Economists use slope to show and predict rates of change.People also use slope in real, concrete ways. For example, slope is used when constructing roads, stairs, ramps, and roofs.; , The term “run” refers to the horizontal distance between two points, or the change in x{\displaystyle x}. When learning about the slope of a line, you will often see the formula slope=riserun{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}\;={\frac {\text{rise}}{\text{run}}}}For example a slope of a line might be 21{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{1}}}. This means that to go from one point to the next, you need to go up 2 along the y-axis, and over 1 along the x-axis.   , You can do this using the slope-intercept form of a line’s equation. The slope-intercept form says that y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b}. In this formula, m{\displaystyle m} equals the slope of the line. You can rearrange the equation of a line into this formula to find the slope.For example, in the equation y=3x+1{\displaystyle y=3x+1}, the slope would be 3{\displaystyle 3}. You can still think of this slope in terms of rise over run if you turn it into a fraction. Any whole number can be turned into a fraction by placing it over 1. So, 3=31{\displaystyle 3={\frac {3}{1}}}. This means that the line represented by this equation rises 3 units vertically for every 1 unit it runs horizontally.     , The larger the slope, the steeper the line. A line is steeper the more vertical it rests on a coordinate plane.For example, a slope of 2 (that is, 21{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{1}}}) is steeper than a slope of 0.5 (12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}).   , A positive slope is one that moves up and to the right. In other words, in a positive slope, as x{\displaystyle x} increases, y{\displaystyle y} also increases.   A positive slope is denoted by a positive number.    , A negative slope is one that moves down and to the right. In other words, in a negative slope, as x{\displaystyle x} increases, y{\displaystyle y} decreases.  A negative slope is denoted by a negative number, or a fraction with a negative numerator.  To help remember the difference between a positive and negative slope, you can think of yourself as standing on the left endpoint of the line. If you need to walk up the line, it’s positive. If you need to walk down the line, it’s negative.Knowing the difference between negative and positive slopes can help you check that your calculations are reasonable.   , A horizontal line is a line that runs straight across a coordinate plane. The slope of a horizontal line is 0. This makes sense if you think of lines in terms of slope=riserun{\displaystyle {\text{slope}}\;={\frac {\text{rise}}{\text{run}}}}. For a horizontal line, the rise is 0, since the y{\displaystyle y} value never increases or decreases. So, the slope of a horizontal line would be 0x{\displaystyle {\frac {0}{x}}}.  , The slope of a vertical line is undefined. In terms of riserun{\displaystyle {\frac {\text{rise}}{\text{run}}}}, the slope of a negative line would be y0{\displaystyle {\frac {y}{0}}}. The run is 0, since the x{\displaystyle x} value never increases or decreases. So, the slope of a vertical line will bey0{\displaystyle {\frac {y}{0}}}, and since you can't divide by 0, any number over 0 will always be undefined.","['vertical distance', 'positive slope', 'vertical line', 'negative slope', 'displaystyle', 'steepness', 'slope', 'run', 'points', 'change', 'horizontal line', 'rise', 'equation', 'line', 'term']"

It can be an extravagant, romantic affair, or just the two of your having fun eating your favorite foods together. Surprise your significant other with a hot, home cooked meal for your anniversary celebration, or prepare the meal together for more of a feeling of togetherness.If you’re looking for a fresh, sophisticated take on the traditional home cooked dinner, plan a wine-and-cheese tasting for two.There’s nothing wrong with grabbing takeout. Chances are, the two of you spend a lot of time preparing food throughout the week. Take the pressure off by having something tasty delivered and spare yourselves the cook time and cleanup.; , If fancy dinners aren’t your thing, order some food to-go and spend the evening relaxing and watching your favorite movies. Not long ago, you had to go to a theater and buy tickets in order to enjoy a movie night with your date. Entertainment models like Redbox and Netflix have made it easier than ever to choose from a near-endless catalog of movies from the comfort of your couch. This way it can just be the two of you and a leisurely night of viewing to give you a break from the hectic day-to-day bustle.If you’re having trouble deciding on what to watch, you can each pick a movie for a custom double-feature.  , Maximize the fun you have with your partner on your anniversary by hosting your own game night. Playing games together is a great way to compete, cooperate and challenge each other to get creative, and can make for a lot of laughs. Break out the board games, or find something interactive, like two-person Pictionary or Charades, for the two of you to do and let the good times roll.Pick a game like chess or Scrabble if you feel like testing your brainpower, or something more physical like Twister if you’d rather get up and move. Don’t forget about video games! A little two-player madness might be just what you need to loosen up on your anniversary.  , What better way to show someone you care than by pampering them? Turn the lights down low, put on some ambient music and treat one another to a sensuous spa day at home. You can take turns giving each other massages, facials and even pedicures, or even just take a long, hot bubble bath together. The most important thing is that you have some uninterrupted time to luxuriate.Pick out some decadent bath soaps, oils, fragrances and candles to transform your bathroom into a tandem spa experience., Surprise your significant other with an anniversary gift that says something heartfelt about your relationship. This might be something that they’ve wanted or needed, or something you’ve heard them mention and remembered without them having to ask. Choosing the right anniversary gift will depend on you and your partner’s relationship and the kinds of things they like, so make sure that whatever you decide on has them in mind and is suited for the occasion.Listen for cues your partner mentions for things they’d like to have and try to make a mental note. Sometimes the best surprises are things you’ve wanted but have hesitated to ask for. Jewelry is a popular gift for anniversaries, especially to commemorate decades, but you don’t have to break the bank buying expensive, impersonal gold and jewels. Try selecting a tasteful piece with your partner’s birthstone or a particular symbol that’s meaningful to them., Take the time to write out a personalized letter or poem by hand. Remind your spouse of what you love about them and of the fond experiences you’ve shared. It’s easy to fall into a routine and leave your deeper feelings unspoken: this will afford you the chance to say the things you don’t always get to say. A handwritten missive is something your loved one will be able to keep and cherish for the rest of their life.   Being mushy isn’t your only option. This is a good opportunity to put your feelings on display, but also to make your partner laugh by coming up with silly rhymes or referencing inside jokes that only the two of you are in on.  , Rather than going out and buying a gift, consider making something yourself. A scrapbook filled with pictures of the two of you would make a great anniversary project, and it’s something that anyone can do. Whatever you make should identify the sentiments and desires of your spouse and will ideally contain some characteristic of your own; your gift will be one-of-a-kind and will therefore mean a lot to your significant other.Think about gifts that are specifically suited to your loved one—for instance, if they’re an ardent reader, fashion a simple, eye-catching set of homemade bookshelves, or design a spice rack for someone who loves to cook. Make a mix tape, burned CD or playlist for your significant other. This is a timeless gesture that never goes out of style, and can be the perfect complement to an anniversary present. Draw on a selection of your favorite tracks to compile a personalized mix and give the gift of music., Write and record a short video message of yourself wishing your spouse a happy anniversary. Simply use your smartphone, tablet or webcam to video yourself marking the day and offering words of affection. We live in an age where technology has made it easier than ever to document our lives, so use this ability to capture a special moment on your anniversary that can be replayed any time and bring tears of joy for years to come.Rehearse your message first and run through it a few times before you record yourself to ensure that you’re able to say exactly what you want to say. Inject some personality into your video message. Sing, dance or use signs and props to make the recording memorable.  , Put aside practical talk of work, money and household responsibilities for the evening and just talk to your loved one. Use this chance to reconnect with them and strengthen the bonds you formed when you were first getting to know each other. Talk about anything and everything: your dreams, beliefs, goals, politics, things that make you laugh. Get to know the person you love again by sharing your innermost thoughts.If you’re married and/or have children together, challenge yourselves to talk about topics other than your jobs, kids and finances. Make your dialogue about the two of you.  , Whether it’s your first anniversary or your fifty-first, the two of you have been through a lot together. Reminisce over these times while you enjoy your dinner, spa night or game session. Trace your history back to the day you met or share funny stories or recollections of fond times. Your unique, ongoing connection should be the centerpiece of your anniversary., Cut loose for the evening and dance! Imagine that you’re with your sweetheart back in high school at prom, or make the living room your own personal nightclub and cut a rug until your feet are sore. Not only is dancing fun, it’s great stress relief and can make you and your partner feel more physically in tune with one another.   Have a good time! Go wild to the upbeat chart-topping hits on the radio and follow it with an intimate slow dance that brings you close. Put on songs that have mutual significance for the two of you, like the song that was playing the first time you met or one that describes the way you feel about each other., The little things we tell each other can become commonplace when we hear them day in and day out. For your special day together, express to your spouse how much they truly mean to you. Sit them down and tell them face-to-face, just the two of you, with no distractions. Saying the words “I love you” is like a form of backing currency: it’s important not just to hear but to know the strength of the feeling behind it.   Telling a significant other that you love them is one the simplest but most powerful gestures you can make in a relationship. No matter how many times you hear it, it’s always touching to be reminded that you’re with someone that cares about you and wants you to know it.  , Anniversaries can be big events, but what’s even bigger is the kinship that you and your loved one share. You wouldn’t have stayed together for a year, or an additional year, if you didn’t feel strongly for them, and even though you might spend everyday together, now is the time to reflect on the things you appreciate about the other and savor being with them. So just relax, treat yourselves and take pleasure in spending the evening with the person who means the most to you.Anniversaries don’t have to be fancy, immaculately-planned occasions. Putting too much emphasis on making the day “perfect” can take away from simply enjoying being in one another’s company. Find activities that you both like to do that let you be together without interruption or distraction.

Heat the milk and butter over medium heat until the temperature reaches 120 to 130 degrees F (48 to 54 C).The butter won't melt completely. You're just warming the milk and butter which will help the yeast dissolve and activate.; , Put 2 tablespoons of packed brown sugar and 1 envelope (2 1/4 teaspoons) of instant yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the warmed milk and butter mixture and stir to dissolve the brown sugar and yeast.If you don't have a stand mixer, place your ingredients in a large mixing bowl and use a hand mixer or large wooden spoon to combine them.  , Add 2 cups of the all-purpose flour and 2 teaspoons of salt to the mixing bowl. Beat the dough for 3 minutes so that the flour is completely incorporated. If the dough looks very sticky and continues to cling to the sides of the bowl, slowly add more flour to make the dough soft. It should start to pull away from the sides of the mixing bowl.Keep track of how much flour you add. Avoid adding more than 1 1/2 cups in total. Add the additional flour in very small amounts (about 1/4 of a cup at a time). It's easier to add flour than remove excess flour from your dough.  , Flour a counter top or bread board. Scoop the dough onto the work space and knead the bread until it's smooth and stretchy. This should take about 8 to 10 minutes of kneading. To knead the dough, punch it down in the center, fold it in half and push it forward with the palm of your hand.   Continue the process of folding and pushing the dough. This kneading will activate the gluten in the bread and help your pretzel bread develop a good consistency.  , Grease a large mixing bowl and set your pretzel dough in the bottom. Cover the bowl and put it somewhere warm and draft-free to prove for one to two hours. Let it prove until it's doubled in size.   It's easiest to use a clear bowl. This way, you can keep an eye on how much your dough has risen. If you can't find a warm spot to prove the dough, try placing it in your unheated oven with the door closed. Turn on the oven light. This should warm the oven enough to prove the dough., Get your oven heating and prepare your baking pan while you boil the pretzel bread. Turn the oven on to 400°F (204°C). To make the boiling solution, put 3 quarts (2.8 liters) of water and 3/4 cup (135 g) of baking soda into a large saucepan or pot over high heat. Bring the solution to a boil.   To prepare your baking pan, simply grease it lightly with shortening or butter.  , Remove your dough from the greased bowl and punch it straight down. Divide the dough into two large pieces and roll each into a smooth ball that is tightly packed. Place the loaves in the boiling solution for 1 minute. Turn them using tongs and boil them for 1 more minute. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove them from the solution.To evenly divide the proved dough, you can cut it in half using a sharp knife or a bench scraper. Always use caution when handling boiling liquid. Use oven mitts when touching the handles of your pot.  , Set both boiled loaves on your greased baking sheet. Brush the beaten egg over the tops and sides of the loaves using a pastry brush. Take a sharp knife and score a cross in the top of each loaf. Bake the loaves for 15 minutes.You can leave off the egg wash, although your pretzel bread won't be as shiny or glossy after it bakes.  , After 15 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and bake the loaves for another 10 to 12 minutes. The pretzel bread should look brown. Carefully remove the baking pan from the oven.Take the loaves off of the sheet and let them cool on a wire rack.

There are two main methods for making soap, the hot process and the cold process.The cold process of making soap is the most common method. It involves mixing an alkali (usually lye) with fats or oils. Once mixed and formed into shape, it can take weeks for the soap to cure. The hot process of making soap requires you to cook the soap. This method requires no cure time, and can make it easier to add scents and colors. However, it is more difficult to work with and mold hot process soap. If you are new to soap making, consider taking a class in your area. Check with local crafts organizations, stores, and soap makers to see what opportunities are available.; , Basic soap making only requires a few ingredients, but a wide variety of types of soap can be make by tweaking the formula.If you want to create a product that stands out, experiment with ingredients like scents, colors, and moisturizers until you create a soap that you think is unique and high-quality.  , Soap making requires a few dedicated tools, and a space to work in (whether just your kitchen, or a full shop). As your soap making operation grows, you might purchase additional equipment, but to start out you will at least need:A blender A microwave Molds A mixing kettle Labelers Wrappers  , You’ll want to set yourself apart from the competition, and create a product that consumers really want. Think about who you want to buy your soaps, and what kind of niche your products will fill.For example, you might create soaps that are entirely free of any animal by-products for those consumers who care about animal rights, or soaps that are made using only all-natural ingredients for consumers who care about “green” and healthy living.Think about:   Creating a unique and memorable company nameUsing specially designed shapes Embossing the soap with letters or other forms Wrapping the soap in special papers or ribbons Creating a logo for your company  , If you want to make soaps on a consistent scale, you will need a steady supply of oils, fats, scents, colors, wrappers, etc. You can go out and purchase all of these things yourself, but to save time and money you can order from suppliers that can ship the materials to you. Look for companies that can supply you with:   OilsMoldsScents and colors Equipment, When you are ready to get your business off the ground, it is a good idea to talk to an accountant, a tax advisor, and an attorney for assistance with the legal and financial aspects of starting a business.While working with these professionals takes time and money, they can make the process easier, and help you avoid costly mistakes later on.   Whether or not you are working with a professional accountant, learn how to use small business accounting software such as Quickbooks.These programs can be a tremendous help in keeping up with inventory, sales, bills, and orders.  , To legally start a soap making business, you will have to formally incorporate a company. The exact requirements for doing so will vary depending on your location.   The Small Business Administration can offer lots of assistance with setting up your business, including finding loans and investors, filling out required forms, getting insurance, meeting tax requirements, etc.You should also contact your area’s local development board or small business administration about local support for setting up your business. If you are planning on hiring other employees, contact the IRS about getting an Employer Identification Number (EIN) for tax purposes., You’ll want to have enough soap on hand to keep up with your orders. You don’t want to have orders coming in and no soap to supply, but on the other hand, you don’t want to invest money in making soaps that aren’t selling. When you are just starting out, it might pay to be a little conservative, but keep good track of your sales so that you can keep the proper inventory of soap around.   Label and package your stock so that it is ready to ship or sell. Follow any labeling regulations in effect in your area. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that you list all ingredients of a soap on its label., For instance, you might price luxury soaps higher than those meant for everyday use. Research what competitors charge for soaps in your area, and set prices that are higher or lower, depending on your sales tactics.   Consider offering specials, like sales around holidays, reduced rates on bulk orders, and offers like “buy 2, get 1 free.” Don’t set prices that are too low or too high. Try to set prices that will allow you to take care of your up-front costs (supplies, transportation, etc.), and hopefully leave a profit. If your sales increase, you can expect your profits to grow, but you don’t want to set prices so high at first that you don’t sell anything.  , To be successful at selling soap, you need to understand your market, and how to reach it.Spread the word about your soaps whenever and however you can, but target your primary market in particular. Common advertising possibilities include:   Word-of-mouth Social media Advertisements online and in traditional media Business cards Sales displays  , Handmade crafts like soaps can be easily sold at various markets and other events. Don't be afraid to travel outside of your local area either, as this can increase your potential customer base. Opportunities may include:Arts and crafts shows Farmers markets Home parties  , Many consumers shop and seek information online, even if they eventually buy products in person. If you want to succeed in the soap making business, be prepared to market your products online.This means not only making soaps available for sale via retailers like Etsy or your own website, but also promoting your product online through social media.   If you sell online, you will need to consider shipping costs and how to handle them. Consider whether you will have customers pay for some or all of the shipping themselves, and whether or not you will offer a variety of shipping options (standard delivery, express, overnight, etc.).  , You can approach existing stores about the possibility of selling yours soaps in them, or investigate opening your own physical store.If you do decide to open your own store, you will have to look for a location, negotiate rent and insurance, decide on business hours, and make other considerations.

"['pay attention', 'approach the loading zone', 'exit the vehicle', 'inform the valet of any problems with the car', 'pick up your vehicle', 'watch for your car', 'carefully pull away']",How to Use a Parking Valet," The number one reason customers get poor service from a Valet is because they are not paying attention to how the system works. Valet drivers and doormen have 2 objectives, serve you while making a good impression, and moving cars in and out of the loading zone quickly. If they cannot move cars quickly, customers become easily annoyed and upset resulting in a poor first impression of the establishment (for example, a restaurant) and lost tips for the Valet. You may be caught off guard by the rushed nature of the interaction between you and the valet, but this is not to be taken for rudeness. So pay attention to what other people are doing, and what the valets are asking of you. Many times customers are being loaded and unloaded on the curb of a busy street. This requires a lot of focus and attention from the Valet as well as the customer.; , Drive slowly into the loading zone and stop behind the car in front of you. Do not get out of your car until the Valet opens your door. Many times a valet will want you to pull forward or move to another position in the loading zone before you exit your vehicle. Watch for direction from the Valet.  , It should be the valet's responsibility to open the doors for the female passengers first. However, sometimes time and circumstances do not permit this. Make the judgment yourself about whether it is within the capability of the valet to perform this service. If there is a lot of traffic and only one or two valets, it may not be possible. When you exit the vehicle, listen carefully for instructions from the valet concerning price, closing time, and how to get your vehicle back. These details are very important. Some valet services may close earlier than the restaurant and leave your car somewhere convenient for you to pick up. If you don't listen, you may have to leave your car overnight and pay an extra fee.  , You do not need to include every detail of the vehicle's performance, but if a door only opens a certain way, or the alarm is finicky, most valets appreciate this information.  , Once you are ready for your car, hand your ticket to the valet standing closest to the valet stand (also known as the ""doorman""), or to the Valet who asks for it. Generally, one or two valets run the stand while others retrieve cars. You can slow the process down by giving your ticket to the wrong person. Once again, don't mistake the rushed atmosphere for rudeness. Usually valets are under a lot more pressure when customers are leaving than when they are arriving.  , When you see your car, quickly gather your party and get in. This is the most common time to tip the valet. Valets usually pool their tips and divide them equally. Usually it does not matter who you tip. If you are paying a fee, this usually goes to the Doorman.  , Watch for other traffic as well as valets. Be aware of your surroundings.

Putting her in a small, confined space will help her feel more comfortable and will allow you to socialize her in an area where she feels at ease. Given your kitten’s instinct to run and hide, choose a space with no hiding places, such as a bathroom.The bathroom has the added benefit of being a place where people normally go. This will allow your kitten to get accustomed to people, which is an important part of her socialization.Other than a bathroom, you could choose another small room that doesn’t have furniture (e.g., couch, bed) that your kitten could easily hide under or behind.Make sure the area is quiet—loud noises would startle your kitten.; , Since this small area will be your kitten’s world for a while, it should have everything she needs to feel comfortable. Place her food and water bowls in the room, along with some comfortable bedding and toys. Put her litter box in the room and clean it regularly. You could even plug in a cat pheromone diffuser.Pheromones are chemicals that animals use to communicate with each other, and can have a calming effect.Cat pheromones are commercially available as spray products and plug-in diffusers at your local pet store. These pheromones can calm your kitten and help her feel less timid. Your kitten will need regular veterinary visits, so she will need to get comfortable with her carrier. Place her carrier in the room. Put some comfortable blankets in the carrier and leave its door open so she can explore it whenever she chooses., Soothing sounds can put your kitten at ease. If your kitten is in a bathroom, place a portable radio in the room and pick either a classical music or talk radio station. If she is in a small bedroom, you could place a TV in the room and turn it to a station where people are talking calmly (e.g. news station). Having a TV on would allow your kitten to get used to human voices., This quiet time will be crucial to socializing her and helping her become less timid. How much time you spend with her will probably vary according to how timid she is. In general, aim to spend about 15 to 20 minutes with your kitten, 3 to 5 times a day.Before you enter your kitten’s space, knock lightly on the door a few times and call out her name.Talk in a soothing voice to your kitten. You could even sing her lullabies!Try slow blinking with your kitten. Slow blinking communicates friendliness. When she does a slow blink back at you, then you will know she feels safe around you.Other than talking quietly with her, you could also read a book or do another quiet activity around her. Do not be surprised if your kitten does not want to get anywhere near you at first.  , Your kitten should be comfortable in her space, but that does not mean you should make major changes to your own routine. Make your usual noises so your kitten can become accustomed to the ‘normal life’ sounds in your home.She will come out of the small space eventually, so she will need to be comfortable with the other noises in your home.  , Getting your kitten used to human touch is an important part of her socialization. Remember, though, that your kitten has claws and will likely use them if she feels threatened by your hand. Wearing a pair of gardening gloves will protect your hands from scratches as your kitten acclimates to your touch.Consider rubbing your hand on the outside of the gloves so your kitten smells your scent as you touch her with the glove. You can also rub that scent on her bedding., As you spend more quality time with your kitten, place your hand gently on the floor for her to explore. When she feels bold enough to approach your hand, give her soft verbal praise. Keep in mind, though, that she may be too shy explore your hand, or not interested in doing so.Hold your hand about one of her body lengths away from you. Be prepared for her to react strongly to your hand (e.g., spitting, hissing, growling, swatting). No matter what she does, keep your hand still to let her know you are standing your ground. Eventually, she’ll stop reacting this way.It may help to give your kitten treats when she explores your hand without reacting negatively. You could also place some treats by your hand to lure her closer to it.  , Once your kitten is comfortable with your hand, begin stroking her gently. Start with the top of her head and ears, where she will not be able to bite you. Do not touch her paws, tails, or underbelly at first—she will probably try to bite you.Make sure to reach from behind when you stroke her—bringing your hand towards your kitten’s face may startle her.If your kitten wants to run away from you in the room, let her do so. Do not try to grab her to keep her close to you., If she’s relaxed or curious, she will be purring and have her ears up. Nervous body language includes tense muscles and hissing. If she’s completely scared, she’ll growl and have a wide-eyed stare.If your kitten has nervous or fearful body language, stop stroking her and let her calm down. If she is displaying relaxed body language, work on stroking other parts of her body, such as her cheeks. As your kitten becomes more comfortable with your stroking, take your glove off and see how she handles your bare hand touching her. Ultimately, she will need to get used to the feel of your bare hand. After some time, try stroking her underbelly. She will need to be comfortable with you touching her there so you can practice picking her up., If your kitten is not adjusting well to human touch, try stroking her lightly with a peacock feather. It will feel lighter, less direct, and possibly less threatening than your hand. Set the feather on the ground first so she can explore it, then use it to stroke her body from head to tail. Watch her body language to see if she likes it or not.Look for peacock feathers at your local pet store. Try using your hand again after your kitten has acclimated to the feather.  , Inevitably, you will have to pick up your cat for one reason or another during her lifetime. Your timid kitten will need to get used to you picking her up. Place a bowl of tasty food in front of her and lift her up while she’s distracted with eating. Gently place your hand under chest and lift her. Try putting her close to your chest so she can feel the comfort of your body heat and beating heart.Lift her up slowly and gently.If your kitten struggles mightily or lashes out at you, put her down softly and try again later.  , Kittens may be tiny, but they have huge appetites. Use this to your advantage as you socialize your timid kitten. In fact, food will be your most important tool as you work with your kitten.Other than her regular kitten food, pick some especially tasty foods—tuna, baby food without onion powder or garlic—as treats that you will give her only when you work with her., Since your kitten is timid, do not expect her to come to you right away for food. She will probably want to stay back until she feels comfortable enough to approach you. When you sit with her, gently toss a small piece of a treat towards her from a few feet away (depending on the size of her small space). If she eats the treat, continue to toss more treats her way, gradually shortening the distance that you toss it.When it’s meal time, place her food bowl a few feet away from you at first. Similar to tossing the treats, gradually shorten the distance between you and the food bowl.Try working up to placing the treats or her food bowl in your lap to encourage her to climb into your lap. You could also place some tasty food on your finger to see if she will eat food from your finger., Do not give your kitten food and then leave the area. Stay with her until she finishes eating, then take the food away when you leave.Staying with her as she eats is another way for her to become more comfortable with your presence.   Because your kitten is timid, it may take a few tries before she actually eats in your presence., Overcoming shyness may be difficult for your kitten. When she is confident enough to be close to you as she eats, reward her for that closeness. As she eats, gently stroke the top of her head and back.   Stroking your kitten as she eats will help her develop a positive association with you and the food you serve her. Give your kitten verbal praise by telling her how brave she is., Playtime is another important component of socializing your timid kitten. Playing gives you quality time with her, and allows her to get some exercise and challenge herself mentally. Interactive playtime can also build up your kitten’s confidence. Examples of interactive toys include laser lights and wand toys with a small toy attached to the end.   Ping-pong balls are another good interactive toy, since you can roll them around on the floor and watch your kitten chase them.Select a variety of interactive toys.  , Whichever toys you choose, set them on the floor and give her time to explore them. Next, slowly pick up one of the toys and gently pet her with it as you did when you stroked her with your hand. This will let her get comfortable with the feel of the toy before you and she start playing with it.As you introduce her to new toys, repeat the same acclimation process.  , Being comfortable enough to play with you will be a big step for your kitten. Make sure you give her plenty of praise so she can continue building up her confidence. In addition, verbal praise will help her make a positive association with playtime.Give your kitten treats as you play with her.Schedule several play sessions each day and keep them short (5 to 10 minutes).

Because they are easily injured, people with Ehlers Danlos Classical Type should avoid all contact sports, as well as other situations in which they are likely to be bumped or jostled with any force.Activities like football, boxing, and even running (due to the strain it can place on the joints) are best avoided to reduce the risk of injury. In day-to-day life, dress yourself in such a way as to reduce the risk of injury. Limit the exposure of your skin and when possible wear multiple layers to prevent scrapes and cushion your body.Always wear a helmet when cycling. Wear elbow, knee, and shin pads when participating in outdoor activities. Soccer pads and ski stockings work well. Children with this condition may need to wear pads at all times., Certain foods can help your body better cope with problems created by Ehlers Danlos Classical Type. Specifically:   Take vitamin C (ascorbic acid). It can reduce bruising when taken regularly.A dose of two grams per day is recommended for adults, though there is no upper limit on how much you can take. Glucosamine, magnesium, calcium, Methyl sulphonyl methane (MSM), silica, pycnogenol, carnitine, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), and vitamin K are also thought to be helpful in alleviating the joint problems often caused by EDS.All of these are available in supplement form.Consult a physician before making any major changes in your diet or before taking supplements.  , People with EDS, Classical Type should not take Acetylsalicylate, more commonly known as aspirin.Many people with this disorder are sensitive to aspirin, and it can worsen bleeding problems.   Other anti-inflammatory drugs may useful in treating joint pain and can be taken to treat discomfort., Specifically, do non-weight bearing exercises. Exercise is important for people with EDS, Classical Type. It helps build muscle strength and coordination that can otherwise be difficult to maintain given the joint problems that often result from this condition.Activities that don't require lifting heavy weight or the risk being struck with hard objects should be undertaken in moderation.   Swimming, badminton, table tennis, and walking are all good options.At the gym, you can use the incline treadmill, elliptical machine, stationary bike, or stepper. Core strength can be built by doing Thera-ball, yoga, ballroom dancing, or Tai Chi.Try doing bodyweight exercises or using a resistance band. Do not lift weights. Avoid cross-fit and Olympic style lifting. Always consult your doctor to find an exercise plan that is right for you.

Include groceries, transportation, social activities, utilities, and gym membership as your expenditures. Make sure you provide realistic numbers so that you can still save in case of emergency.Do not be tempted to look at apartments above your price range. You will waste time and resources looking at larger and newer spaces that you cannot afford.; , Don’t be fooled by small perks. If a landlord throws in a tv or let’s you move in early, it may be a waste if the apartment doesn’t meet one of your larger needs. Make sure to set your priorities and don’t compromise them.Remember that you may be locked into a lease so make your decision wisely.  , Prices may be much higher during the summer because that’s when a lot of people tend to search for a new apartment. Depending on where you live and whether you have a timeline, it may be best to search during October to December or February through March.People do not want to move during the holidays or cold months so take advantage of the drop in competition. Places tend to stay vacant during these times so you may see some prices drop if you are willing to wait a month or so.If you live in a location with a lot of college students, waiting until after school starts in September can help you find a reduced rental rate., Don’t spend time looking at everything that’s available. Search online and create a list of no more than four or five apartments to visit. Schedule your visit as opposed to simply dropping by.Take photos and ask questions during your visit to make sure the apartment meets all your standards. If the person showing the apartment is unable to answer a question, be sure to get his contact information so that you can follow up.  , Depending on your time and resources, you may be able to look at a number of apartments. Keep all the information organized in a single document complete with pictures and a pros and cons list. You may also be able to place them on a map and order them according to convenience of travel from your work or school.Spreadsheets are great to keep track of things like rent, amenities, security deposit, lease length, and contact information. Keep any additional notes and how many times you have visited the location. The more informed of a decision you can make, the better., Public transportation can save you money or be necessary during emergencies. Make sure you know how far your apartment is from major transportation routes.Even if you have a car, researching how much you may save on insurance, gas, and travel time may cause you to change how you commute.  , It may seem counterintuitive but new buildings may have reasonable rents because a new apartment complex may want to fill up as fast as possible. Owners and managers may be flexible with their rent if they are trying to lease the entire building. Make sure to see if there is room to negotiate., Apartment locators are in constant contact with landlords and may become aware of decreases in prices, rent specials, or deals before they become available to the public. They may have personal relationships with landlords that can help you find a deal unavailable to anyone else.Search social media or job boards for apartment locators. It may be free to use the services of an apartment locator in your city so research any costs that may be associated before investing.  , If you have been looking for a while and you are finding it increasingly difficult to find an apartment in your price range, expand your search criteria. You may look at locations a little bit further than you originally planned or building without certain amenities. Prioritize what you are able to be flexible with and change your search criteria.Many times it is the location that is the most difficult thing to find as the most prime apartments are often taken or priced for their coveted location. While your commute may factor into your location, also factor in safety and cleanliness. Adding a few minutes to your commute is an easy sacrifice for a safe and clean apartment.  , If you’re moving with other people, make sure that everyone has a chance to see the place before signing anything. Get everyone’s feedback and opinion and make sure you all get a chance to discuss your likes and dislikes.Don’t rely on pictures. Make sure that each roommate gets to physically see the apartment so that they can form a solid opinion.  , There may be special move-in offers or certain special discounts depending on the apartment. Some landlords offer the first month free if you sign a longer lease. You may also get bonuses if you have referred a friend.It never hurts to ask what’s available to you. There may also be discounts for students, retirees, veterans, or individuals with special needs. Refer to any professional affiliations as well.  , Ask the landlord about the average utility cost before signing anything. The rent may be exactly at your budget but any additional cost may hurt you as the lease goes on. Make sure you get a sense of the hidden costs utilities may provide.  , Once you have narrowed down your top three choices, negotiate with the landlords and let them know that you have other options. If a landlord knows that you are interested but have other options, she may be willing to come down in price or work to find other bonuses like extra storage or parking., If you don’t get the apartment that you want there may be something similar in the same building or another building owned by the same landlord. Consider moving into a studio instead of a one-bedroom or getting a roommate for a two bedroom. Buildings will have apartments with similar floor plans with an extra bedroom., Amenities like free Wi-Fi or gym may save you money on outside costs. However, don’t let amenities be the driving force of your decision. Carefully consider what you are willing to pay in rent for your amenities.Views are also great to have but not a necessity. Inquire if there are similar apartments within the building but without the same view. This can help save you money.  , The physical building may impress you but get a sense of your neighbours and what the living conditions may be like. Tenants can tell you if it’s noisy on the weekend or if there are newborns on your floor. You also want to find out about your landlord. You want to make sure he is safe, courteous and maintains the apartment promptly.Inquire about infrastructure issues, response time to tenant issues, tenant turnover, and safety issues. It is also wise to ask about the area and the typical cost of living. Find out about what tenants pay for utilities, entertainment, and transportation. Ask about the school district if you’re moving with a family, restaurants, grocery stores, and closest amenities.  , Think of your application as a rental resume and make sure you put your best foot forward. The documents that you should include are:A copy of your rental application. You should have filled this out online. If they asked you to fill it out in person, make sure that you provide neat handwriting. A copy of your credit report. A letter of reference from your current or last landlord. If this is your first apartment you can provide a character reference from an employer or teacher if you are a student. A copy of your current or most recent apartment lease. Employment verification. This should include a copy of your most recent tax return or W-2 as well as your three most current pay stubs. A summary of yourself. Don’t go into detail but give a positive glimpse of the type of tenant you will be. Talk about your hobbies and lifestyle to paint you as an ideal tenant. Any details about any pets if you currently have one.  , If your documents aren’t enough to persuade your landlord, offer to pay rent a week or even a month in advance until the month before the expiration of your lease. Show her that you are easy to manage and reliable.You may also be given a deal if you offer to pay in advance or offer an extra incentive to make your landlord’s life easier.  , Once you are satisfied with the location, landlord, and apartment, conduct a final walk-through before signing anything. Be sure that you won’t be held responsible for any damages caused by the previous tennant and make sure to check the following with your landlord:Check that all the lights, faucets, and toilets work properly. Look for any presence of rodents or insects specifically droppings, chew marks, or eggs/larvae in the storage spaces. Make sure all outlets work. Bring your phone charger and plug it into each outlet. Check smoke alarms and fire equipment. A smoke extinguisher may be placed in the kitchen. Open and close all the windows and doors. Make sure the locks work and there is no damage. Make sure all appliances work. Turn them off and on. Ask to be walked through the functionality to ensure that they work. Examine the walls, floors, and ceiling for damage. Inspect tiles, linoleum, drywall, and carpet. Take pictures of any issues and make sure your landlord takes note. You may be able to negotiate changing something or a drop in rent. Be sure to save the pictures in case there are discrepancies with maintenance or issues getting your security deposit back.  , Take the time to fully comprehend your lease. If you need to take it home or ask questions, don’t hesitate. This is a big commitment so don’t feel rushed or pressured. Leases vary depending on length of time and contract terms. Sign only when you feel comfortable.Periodic leases work well for a short duration because the landlord acknowledges that your situation may change every month. This allows you to renew with each new month. While it gives you more flexibility, they may be more costly.Most common is a fixed-term lease. These usually range from three, six, or twelve months. While you can lock in a lower rate, you may be responsible for the rest of your lease if you must break it before the expiration date. Discuss contingencies with your landlord as you may be able to just pay a penalty if you have to break your lease.Subleases are three-party lease agreements that happen when you have to break your lease but are able to find someone to takeover paying the remainder of your lease agreement. The new tenant takes over the remaining lease term with the approval of the landlord.","['budget range', 'lease', 'landlord', 'special discounts', 'year', 'amenities', 'apartment locator', 'tenants', 'documents', 'time', 'picture', 'new construction', 'roommates', 'average energy costs', 'walk-through', 'search', 'mind', 'ease', 'research public transportation']"

Remember, ""Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest.""-Matthew 11:28  , Whether it is for the better, or worse, it will change. God often makes things get worse on the way to better. Focus on the facts. God sees a bigger picture than we do. He knows our every need, and everything that will ever happen. In fact, He creates it! “For I am the Lord, your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, do not fear; I will help you.” –Isaiah 41:13  , Every difficult moment is a gift.

And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us."" -Romans 5:3-5  , Every tragedy has lessons, from calamity to triumph, which God presents to us, in order to gain His wisdom. You may come to discover yourself as an individual, in terms of who you are. God reveals amazing things before us. He knows us and loves us more than we could, or may ever imagine! He shows us our motives and our individuality, just when we forget who we are.  , Note the way in which all of these fit together and bring you to faith. Record every lesson learned, every joyful experience, all of your hopes, dreams, and aspirations; every pain and peaceful moment. You may choose to journal this account. Look for patterns. Begin to notice this as part of His plan. Cherish this plan, and find enthusiasm that Jesus will show you where you need to be. Everything is a gift from Him; all are blessings, that one day lead us to our life purposes. Every experience leads us to something more, and unto what God meant for us to do and be: serve Him.

"['communicate', 'always be there for them to talk to and ask advice of', ""don't compare yourself and/or your teen in ways such as"", '""why can\'t we be more like ____?""', 'give your teen a break', 'be clued in', 'set down ground rules', ""and make sure they're obeyed"", 'punish bad behaviour', 'and make sure your punishment is effective', 'reward good behaviour', 'be fair', 'be positive']",How to Parent a Teen," Many parents stop trying to keep a bond with their child after a few harsh words. The best way to keep your relationship is to continue trying to communicate with your teen. Don't give up if it doesn't usually work—once in a while it will. Be careful not to be pushy, though.; , If your teen feels like they can come to you and that you'll always be behind them every step of the way, they're more likely to open up to you. This may sound stupid, but it will actually help. Not only will your relationship with your teen improve, but you are more likely to be aware of what they're up to and what's going on in their heads. So make sure you're supportive of your teen, and that you always seem approachable. Don't judge them, and don't lecture them for making mistakes. Mistakes are a huge part of life. ""Live and learn,"" is a very popular quote for a reason. Be supportive when they have made a mistake, and help them to see: the way out; the lesson in the mistake; how to avoid such mistakes in the future; the faulty thought process leading up to the poor choice; etc.  , Teens can't be perfect right now - they have a lot more to deal with than parents think. Teen years are very stressful, as teens have to find time to finish homework (so parents don't get mad at bad grades) while balancing social life. Teens have to deal with other things, too, such as living above the influence, not going out with ""bad"" people, and dealing with gossip. The list goes on and on.  , Once in a while, your teen might get a little out of control, causing yelling or having an argument with you. Some times your teen doing this to protect himself. For example: if you think s/he is doing something wrong and you give a huge lecture about it, its only of the teenage nature to be defensive and non-admitting to it. No one (even parents) likes to be wrong about things. Other times s/he may be trying to talk to you. Its hard to communicate with a parent who is constantly yelling. Some times s/he may say things like, ""You don't understand,"" because it really does feel that way. Try to find a friend or someone else your teen can talk to if that happens.  , If you're easy to lie to and trick, teens are going to take advantage of you. Also, if you have no idea of what's going on in your teen's life, big changes could be happening and you'll have no idea, so be clued in. Make sure you always know where your teen is, and that they are actually where they say they are. Know who they hang around with, know what sports teams and clubs they're a part of. Don't let yourself be tricked. And don't let yourself be lied to-don't accept everything that comes out of your teens' mouth. Some parents may think their teenagers would never lie to them, but you'd be surprised.  , If you just start making up rules every five seconds, your teen is going to be confused and things will get out of hand. So come up with your basic rules and conditions, and clearly explain them to your teen. Make sure your teen obeys them. If they have to do their homework before going anywhere, make sure that actually happens. Don't be a softy -- be strict but fair with the rules.  , If you punish your teen by taking away their stereo when they have an iPod they can take everywhere with them, things aren't going to work out too well. Confiscate things that you know they only have one of. Take away privileges. Make sure you master the art of punishments-don't ground your teen for half a year for forgetting to do their chores. At the same time, don't ban TV for a week if they've vandalized someone's house. Make sure your punishments fit the ""crimes"".  , If your teen improves really well on a subject, treat them. If they do something good without being asked, reward them. You don't have to go out and buy them a car for every good thing they do, obviously, but if your teen does something really good, then treat them. Let them have a party if they usually aren't allowed to-that kind of thing. If it's a smaller thing, you may not want to do anything big, but make sure you praise them. A few rewards go a long way.  , If you're a fair parent, your teen is more likely to obey your rules. Make sure that you always make fair rules, and always take their side of the story into consideration. Don't automatically assume they've done wrong, and don't unfairly punish them. If you're fair, your teen's behaviour will probably be better. However, don't let them push you.  , Instead of telling your teen, ""You aren't doing a good enough job,"" or, ""I expect better of you,"" try saying something like, ""I like that you did that but ______."" Telling your teen that s/he isn't good enough or things like that not only damages his/her self esteem but makes him/her even more stressed and mad. Compliments help greatly.

"['whine a little', 'take time (off)', 'get a stable income', 'finish school', 'quit the nasty habits', 'start thinking proactively', 'determine exactly who you want to be']",How to Start a New Life when You're at Rock Bottom1," That's right. That's the first step to starting over. You gotta feel what you're feeling. Clamming everything up will just make you explode later. And what's more: admitting this is how it is could fuel you to do something about it. Acknowledging your situation and not liking it is the only way you can do something about it. So go ahead. Whine. You're unsatisfied. That's how living works.   Talk about it. You know how dieters are supposed to have a diet buddy, or at least let the world know what they're going through? That's for support and accountability. It's the same principle here. Even if you just find one person, you'll have a friend to lean on and someone that can keep you on track when you slip. We all need that support.; , The fact of the matter is that right now you need a break. Sometimes, life just needs to stop. In as much as you can actually do this, grab that Kit Kat and take a short hiatus. Start replenishing your energy bar for the massive endeavor you're about to rock, showing life who's boss.   If you have a job, you may need to take time off work. Not a long time -- nothing to get you fired. Just a day or two to assess and concentrate. Right now is all about you.  , There's a definite hierarchy of needs that all humans have. For most of us, it involves having money at our disposal. In order to have food on the table, you gotta have money in your pocket. You don't need a lot, but in order to move up the hierarchy (and to start thinking about climbing up), you need a stable income.   So to put it succinctly, if you're unemployed, start looking for work. Looking for work should take you 40 hours a week. In today's economy, it may not come easily, but it'll come. Keep your nose to the grindstone and leave no stone unturned, nor opportunity turned down.  , If you haven't finished high school, this is doubly important. In order to get a job, you'll need a GED. All it takes is pulling up a Google search and making a phone call to a local adult education center. Most places can help you work out a payment plan and want to see you on the right track. What's more, where's the harm in just asking?   If you have some college, but haven't graduated, consider going back. Not only will you up your employment options, but you'll feel good about yourself. You'll feel accomplished. After all, rock bottom is just a state of mind. There are plenty of people who others might consider to be on rock bottom that feel on top of the world. Finishing college could change your mindset entirely.  , If you're smoking, drinking, or partaking in other addictive behaviors on a constant basis, it needs to stop now. There is no personal advancement if it does not. In order to see progress, you cannot keep your old tricks. The buck stops here.   Imagine the person you want to be. Does that person have a dependency on anyone or anything else? When it comes to this self project, why settle for anything less than that ideal image? You owe it to you to be the best you can be. If you can't kick this habit, none of the new, better habits will fall into place.  , When you need to change everything about your situation and to completely start over in life you need to make some major adjustments between your ears. You need to think like a new person, act like a new person, dress like a new person, and surround yourself with new people, yes. However, to do this, you need to start thinking positively and with conviction. Put away the ""I can't,"" ""what if?"", and ""maybes."" There's no room for those here. This starting over? You're going to do it.   It's highly possible that training your brain to think differently could alleviate this situation entirely. What are you but your thoughts, anyway? While it's impossible to instruct someone on how to specifically do this, know that the rest of this page will make that process a lot easier. Thinking positively and with confidence will make all these steps doable.  , What will you look like. What will you dress like? What will your relationship look like? Where will you live? What car will you be driving? Take a good 15 minutes, close your eyes and really imagine the life you want down to what you feel like in that life. Take a good mental snapshot of your perfect life. You need to believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that this person you envisioned will be you.   You need an end point in order to know just how and where to start your journey. Where do you want to end up? What goals would you like to reach? Write it down. Everybody needs something to work to because none of us is perfect. Now's your chance to pick yours. This is what you'll be aiming for.  ","['nasty habits', 'stable income', 'time', 'finish school']"

When writing down your list, make sure that the hobbies are things that make you happy.If you enjoy the outdoors, you can hike, fish, or landscape. If you enjoy art or music you can pick up your old instrument or take up painting. Other hobbies include painting, biking, cooking, photography, embroidering, yoga, or joining a community sports team.; , As a parent with limited time, choosing a hobby that you can do in the house will cut down on time wasted commuting to your hobby and will make it easier to do it whenever you have surprise downtime. Think of hobbies like reading, gaming, or exercising that are fairly easy to do at home.Reading, painting, writing, and learning a new language are all things you can do in the house.  , Some hobbies that require a lot of travel or equipment may become expensive. If you are already on a tight budget, find a hobby that is affordable or free. If you can spend the money, consider taking a class or going to special events.Some affordable hobbies include writing, gardening, discovering new music, knitting, drawing, and starting an online blog., As a parent, there may be unexpected scheduling restraints from your children or partner. For this reason, it may be better to choose a low-commitment hobby that isn't critically important to others or requires you to invest a lot of your time. Think of lower stress hobbies that you can do independently if your schedule is hectic.  Some low commitment hobbies include hiking, reading, journaling, volunteering, and cooking., Time wasted on the cell phone or surfing the web can be used to enjoy your hobby instead. Instead of looking at things on your phone, use the time to practice your hobby., When children are at school, sleeping for the night, playing video games, or hanging out with their friends, it gives you time to enjoy your personal hobby. Use this time as time off from your children to enjoy your hobby., If you need to get out of the house to do your hobby, you may need someone to look after the kids. If parenting duties and work take up the majority of your time, you can ask your partner to take care of the kids for a limited period of time so that you can enjoy your hobby., You can ask a family member to take care of the kids or you can get a babysitter to look after them if you can't do your hobby at home. Getting a babysitter or someone to look after your kids is a way that you and your partner can enjoy your hobby together., If you don't already have a detailed schedule, you should write it down so that you have a better understanding of when you'd be able to partake in your hobby. For example, if you work 9-5 and have a babysitter until 7, it gives you 2 hours after work to enjoy your hobby. Find other areas of downtime in your schedule., Have a conversation with your partner on mutual interests and see if you can do the hobby together. This may help strengthen your relationship and deepen the connection with your partner. You can learn a new sport together, cycle, bird watch, hike, or cook together.Say something like, ""I really like going hiking, being out in nature, and birdwatching. Do you think you'd enjoy doing that with me sometime?""  , You can involve your children when doing your hobby to strengthen the bond with your child and improve their self-esteem. Think of age-appropriate ways that you can incorporate your child in what you are doing. If you love playing music, try teaching them how to play an instrument. If you enjoy art, give them a paintbrush to see what they can create.You can also involve your kids with cooking, art, video games, sports, model making, puzzles, or woodworking.  , If you enjoy fishing, hiking, or being in nature, a trip to a park is an excellent way to get the entire family involved in your hobby. As you do what you enjoy, your family can become engaged with the things that interest them the most. Traveling with your family gives everyone the chance to do what they want in a fun environment while giving your time to enjoy your favorite activity.If you like taking photos, you can take your family on trips to historic sites or places in nature.

Using a long stick or piece of grass, touch it to the deer's open eye. If there is any reaction at all, a sound chest or neck shot will end things. If not mounting the head, a head shot would work also.  , This will help it drain as you dress it.  , Roll up your sleeves and put on the gloves.  , Bucks especially have a stronger musk and if this gets into the meat it will make it more gamy. Avoid touching the tarsal glands on the hind limbs of the deer (located at the ankles, they are a patch of longer fur and are often much darker in color), The object is to detach the anus and colon from the hide to prevent tearing and the soiling of meat by the deer's droppings. Gently tug the anus and attached colon (intestines) a few inches back away from the deer's body. If desired, you can tie it in a knot at this point.  , Or, if you have a hunting partner with you, they can help by holding the leg up.  , You can find it by feeling along the ribcage, to where it ends and forms a V shape at the base of the chest, just above where it meets the belly.  , Point the blade end of the knife toward the rear of the deer.  , You should be able to feel the difference between the hide wall and the membrane/muscle wall that holds the innards inside. The goal in the next part is to cut through the hide and muscle wall only to prevent cutting of the organs and tainting of the meat.  , When done properly there is no gore.  , Using care not to cut yourself or the guts, sever the attaching tissues. These tissues are stringy and attach the internal organs of the deer to its body and most are located along the spine. Unless you have the misfortune to have gut-shot the deer you should still have little to no gore or mess. The guts will tend to stay together.  , If the deer was heart/lung shot this is when you will need to be ready for gore; if necessary you may need to roll the deer onto its belly, and splay the limbs for a few minutes to let it drain.  ,, Some prefer to cut through the sternum to open the rib cage. Some do not. If cutting through the rib cage it is pretty straightforward- simply sever the trachea as high up as possible, and the rest comes out.  , Be very careful-- broken bones/shoulders/ribs are sharp on a deer! Feel your way up the trachea as far as you can, then using your other hand very carefully sever the trachea as far up as you can. The lungs and heart should pull free easily now. Always use caution and care! Do this step at home if you are not feeling comfortable with it in the field.  , Use special care not to sever the bladder or colon/intestines! You can pull the colon and attached anus back into the body cavity to remove them. With a male deer you can now remove the internal genitalia. Check your state's regulations as sometimes it is necessary to leave the external genitalia in tact to prove the gender of your deer.  ,, A trick is to take the deer by the antlers (or ears) and lift the head high while draining; this will allow any extra blood to drain out through the chest cavity.  , The heart and liver are widely considered desirable.As a precaution, avoid the brain, spinal cord, eyes, spleen, tonsils and lymph nodes if you are in an area where ""chronic wasting disease"" has affected deer.The rest you can leave if it is okay with the landowner to do so- the ravens, crows, foxes and other critters will thank you for the feast! They won't be wasted. Remove your gloves and put them in a carry-out trash bag and use some bottled water, snow, or nearby clean water source to scrub off any remaining blood. Don't forget to wash up thoroughly at home with soap and water.  , Keep the carcass as chilled and free of debris as possible. The sooner you can process it, the better quality your meat will be.  ,","['water', 'tact', 'heart', 'perimeter', 'angle', 'organs', 'gut pouch', 'belly', 'hind leg', 'minutes', 'finger', 'case', 'rear end', 'knife', 'ring', 'chest cavity', 'length', 'access', 'head/neck/shoulders', 'hind legs', 'tarsal glands', 'fingers', 'inner walls', 'front shoulders', 'slot', 'supplies', 'anus', 'hands/arms', 'pelvic bone', 'slit', 'diaphragm', 'hide/thin muscle', 'side', 'sharp short knife', 'gloved fingers', 'sternum', 'spine', 'connective tissues', 'deer', 'strong musk', 'head', 'tree', 'drag rope', 'trachea', 'method', 'times', 'sharp knife', 'body cavity', 'ways', 'guide', 'flat side', 'guts', 'ankles']"

The substitute may also choose to tell you a bit about themselves, or they may not. When they begin speaking at the beginning of class, give them your full and undivided attention.  This means that you should put away anything you were working on for a different class. You should also put away any cell phones, laptops, tablets, or or other electronic devices that may take your attention away from the teacher.; , Many substitute teachers will take attendance by calling out the name of each student at the beginning of class. This is because they don’t know the names of everyone and they want to see who is present and who is not. Though some students may try to give the substitute a hard time by making jokes or telling them the wrong name, resist this temptation. Giving them a hard time will only show them that they have to be very strict with you to keep you under control.  When they say your name, simply say “here” and raise your hand so they can find you quickly and easily. If they go around the room asking everyone’s name then say your name clearly and loud enough for them to hear when it is your turn.  , Your teacher likely left behind an assignment for you to complete while they are away. If so, complete the assignment as instructed. If the substitute makes it clear that you are allowed to work with your neighbor on the assignment, then talk quietly. If you are not normally allowed to work together, don’t push the boundaries by trying to work together on the assignment when the substitute is there.  If you need help with the assignment, take it up to the teacher and ask if they can help you with your question. Understand that they may not be able to help you since they don’t normally teach the class. Try to ask your question quietly so that you don’t embarrass them in front of the whole class if they don’t know the answer.  , If your teacher has given you a free-day, then use the time to work on other assignments. If the substitute has said they don’t mind if you talk to one another, then feel free to do so, but keep it quiet. Don’t take this as permission to go crazy.   Sometimes substitute teachers will put on a movie to watch. If you don’t want to watch the movie, you don’t have to, but don’t be disruptive to everyone else. Work on another assignment, or do something quiet like drawing or journalling.  , When the substitute gave you the assignment, they likely explained when you should hand it in. If they instructed you to hand it in as soon as you are finished then bring the assignment up to their desk as soon as you are finished. If they instructed you to hold on to the assignment until the end of class, then leave it lying on your desk until you have been instructed to pass it in.   If the substitute has not made it explicit that you can work together, then don’t share your answers with a classmate. The teacher may think you are cheating, which could cause a lot of problems. You may also be asked to turn in the assignment when your teacher returns. If this is the case, keep it in your school bag so you don’t lose it.  , Just because you know you have a substitute teacher doesn’t mean you can be late. Even if your normal teacher doesn’t usually get mad if you are late, you should plan to be on time. A strict substitute teacher may send you to the principal if you are late. Even if they don’t send you to the principal, being late to class still gives your substitute teacher a bad first impression.If you are late because, for example, you were finishing up an assignment from a different teacher, ask that teacher if they can give you a note explaining why you were late. If you have to be late, but aren’t able to get a note to excuse your lateness, apologize to the teacher when you arrive in the classroom and sit down as quickly and quietly as possible in order to avoid being too disruptive.  , If you are on time and waiting for class to begin then sit quietly. If the substitute has not arrived to class yet, you can chat quietly with whoever is sitting next to you, but as soon as they arrive stop talking and wait quietly for them to begin class.Some substitute teachers will feel intimidated walking into a full classroom. If everyone is chatting and ignoring them, it will only make them feel more anxious about taking control of the class. If they can see that you are trying to be respectful and not give them a hard time they will be more relaxed and friendly.  , Sometimes there will be situations where the substitute doesn’t know everything about how things are normally done. If your substitute isn’t sure about something, such as when class normally ends, then help them out. If they don’t know how to work the smart board or the computer offer to help them if you know how.If your substitute teacher has had bad experiences with students in the past they may be a bit distrusting. If the teacher isn’t sure what time class ends raise your hand and politely say what time the class ends. Offer to show them a copy of your class schedule, which will show the beginning and ending time of each class if they seem skeptical about you are telling them. If the substitute has asked you to stay for some reason wait as instructed. However, you should politely remind them that you have to get to your next class on time.  , This isn’t entirely necessary, but if you think the substitute teacher did a good job let them know by saying, “Thank you for a nice class” as you walk by them on your way out.   They may appreciate this acknowledgment of a job well done more than you think. If you didn’t enjoy the class or you don’t think they did a good job, don’t have to say anything. Resist the temptation to say something rude. You may be right, but being rude won’t make the situation any better.  , Try to remember that all teachers, even substitute teachers are also human beings. They can usually tell if you are being insincere when you say something, and they don’t enjoy being treated badly. Therefore, when talking with your teacher, be polite and friendly.If you are not normally polite with your teachers, then consider trying to improve your behavior. Think about why you don’t normally treat them with respect. You don’t have to love every teacher you have, but remember that they are there to help you learn. Being rude will only make this more complicated.  , Throughout your life, you will meet many people, and you probably won't like all of them. However, you should try to be courteous even if you don’t really enjoy their company. Doing so will make your life easier because you won’t be having confrontations with everyone you disagree with, and it will make you a more likeable person as well.  For example, one day, when you have a career, you will probably have to work with people that you don’t get along well with. If you are unable to find a way to work with this person you could lose your job so it’s important to find ways to communicate and be courteous with those you don’t like. This doesn’t mean you have to pretend to be best friends. It does mean that you have to find a way to work together to accomplish the goal at hand. In this case, the goal is to get through the class without causing problems, while also learning any new information or completing any assignments left behind by your teacher.  , This can be difficult with someone you don’t like, but as you grow into an adult you will learn that you have to be civil, even with people you don’t like. Dealing with a substitute teacher you don’t like offers good practice. If they are rude to you, don’t respond by being rude back as this is probably what they are counting on.   When the substitute addresses you, respond politely. Hide your dislike behind your manners. For example, if the teacher asks you a question, don’t respond by saying something rude. For example, if they ask you something, don’t say, “I don’t know. Why don’t you figure it out?” If you don’t know the answer then say something like, “I’m sorry Mr./Ms. (say the last name of your substitute), but I don’t know the answer.” If possible, offer to try and find the answer.  , If you don’t like the teacher, you may feel tempted to say rude things or give them a hard time simply because you don’t like them. This may give you some satisfaction in the moment, but in the long run it probably won’t be worth it. The substitute may report you to your teacher, which will probably get you in trouble. If you encounter this substitute again, it is unlikely they will have forgotten you and your behavior so they will treat you as a bad student.   This doesn’t mean that you should ignore the teacher if they speak directly to you. If they ask you a question or say something to you, then acknowledge this by answering as politely as possible. However, try to keep the conversation short. If you want to avoid confrontation, then don’t encourage an argument or further discussion by asking a follow-up question or by trying to start a debate with them.  , Although unlikely, if your substitute teacher is threatening students with physical violence or is making inappropriate remarks then you should get help immediately if you fear for your safety or the safety of another student.If you are worried that you or someone else is in danger, leave the classroom immediately. Go to the main office where you can find the principal, the vice-principal, or the secretary. If you can’t find someone there, go into the nearest classroom to tell the teacher there. Explain to them what is going on, and ask them to come help with the situation because you are worried something bad may happen.

You might also consider installing a Dutch door at the front of your house. This will allow you to let in some sun and air while keeping your toddler off the street and out of the driveway and garage area., Place a two by four under the garage door, press close and see if the garage door senses the block of wood. If the garage door senses the wood and reverses direction, it is working fine. If it closes on the block of wood, it will not be safe for children. In this case, you should replace your garage door opener.It is mandatory for garage doors to be equipped with an auto-reverse function and photoelectric sensors for safety reasons. The auto-reverse mechanism was introduced in 1982 and the photoelectric sensors were introduced in 1993.If your garage door was installed prior to 1993 or not updated, you may want to replace it. Keep your garage door controls out of reach of children. Install the garage door opener switch high enough so that small hands cannot reach it. If you have a mobile garage door opener, you should keep this away from your children.Exercise caution, and make sure that your garage door is in working order if you have a manual garage door. Keep children away from the moving parts of a garage door in order to avoid any crushing or pinching of hands.  , It is tempting to drive away from your home without watching the garage door fully close. However, sometimes a small object gets in the way and the auto-reverse mechanism is engaged. In this case, you will be leaving the house with the door open and the garage accessible to your children.Avoid storing things too closely to the garage door. If you store things too closely to the door, they may fall onto the door and interrupt its operation., Once a month, you should take a quick look at your garage door to make sure it is operating smoothly. Open and close it a couple of times to see if it is opening slower than usual or if there are any unusual creaks. Look at the cables, springs, and pulleys to see if they look worn down.If there is something wrong with the door, you should contact a garage door serviceman.

"[""create a will to distribute your estate assets to whomever you desire.if you don't have a plan"", 'the government will handle it for you through a process called intestacy.intestacy rules within each state serve to approximate the intent of an average person dying without a plan for their possessions', 'name an executor', 'name guardians for children under the age of 18', 'create an inventory', 'or account', 'of the estate for distribution to heirs', 'decide how to pass down your assets', 'decide how your heirs should pay off your debts', 'create a backup plan within your will', 'check the beneficiary lists of your retirement accounts', 'specify your end of life plans in case you cannot make your wishes known', 'make your funeral arrangements in advance', 'consider creating a trust to avoid public records', 'differentiate between supervised and unsupervised distribution', 'determine who will act as personal representative of the estate', 'calculate the estimated value of the estate', 'determine with an estate lawyer whether or not you need to go through probate', 'determine which of your assets are part of the probate estate']",How to Set up an Estate," That's a highly unscientific approach that can lead to fighting and an unfair distribution of your wealth. There are three ways to set up a will:    Statutory Wills: These are public forms that only require you to fill in blanks about who is getting what. Because they are public, they are quickly accepted by courts of law, though not all states will have them.Personal Wills: You can write your own will, though you need to be very specific about what is going where to avoid complications. You will need 2 witnesses to sign as well. There is also software that can help you write the will.Working with a Lawyer: Your safest bet when writing a will is to hire a lawyer. They can answer questions, help avoid pitfalls, and defend your intentions after you die. Simple wills cost anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand dollars.; , The executor is the person in charge of your estate after you've died. That's the person who will likely be in full control of your assets. The executor needs to be named in your will and you should consider assigning an alternate in case your first choice is unable to help. Talk to the person you have in mind before you die to make sure he or she is okay with the responsibility, then send the executor a sealed copy of the will when it is finished.   Spouses are most commonly named executors, as they are familiar with the estate. Trusted friends and family members make good executors. If you do not name an executor one will be court appointed, which could lead to executor expenses for your family., To avoid dragging any minor children through the courts, it's best to name a guardian for minor children in the will. Make sure you talk to the person first to make sure he or she is okay with the potential responsibilities of caring for you children.   You should similarly account for any of your pets., The inventory should contain a list of all of your debts and assets, the approximate value of each, whether the assets will pass directly to a new owner, and a total debt and asset value. The list may need to be formal, delivered to the heirs in a specific form or manner, and/or filed with the court. Check your state’s probate code or check with your attorney to determine if the inventory should be filed with the Court and how it should be distributed to the heirs. For now, simply create the list so you know what needs to be distributed in your will.    Assets are anything that can be sold for money. Debts are bills, loans, or expenses that need to be paid after your death. The value of real estate listed on the inventory should be the most recently appraised value. Consult an attorney or a certified public accountant to determine if a formal appraisal is required in your state. Personal property values listed on the inventory are calculated based on current market value by agreement of the heirs, or appraisal of the personal property by a licensed appraiser.  , This is the major headache in a will, but it is incredibly important to prevent disputes after your death. Next to each asset listed, note who will receive the asset after your death. Make sure you are detailed and specific -- sometimes the biggest fights are over the smallest things, like a sentimental lamp or piece of jewelry.You can also ""lump"" things together with phrases like ""all of my furniture and household objects will be given to my son, Thomas Kitchener.""  , Account for the money you still owe and make sure it can be paid without expense to your heirs. This may require selling off assets, such as noting to ""sell my house and use the money to pay off any outstanding mortgage payments,"" or noting an account that should be used for payment, such as an unused retirement account.  , Some things will, without a doubt, fall through the cracks as you plan your will. If you do not have something accounted for in your will then it will be up to the state to distribute it. The easiest way to avoid this is with a backup clause, something along the lines of: ""all other assets will be placed in the care of my husband, Steven Johnson.""   Wills are commonly used as a backup to a trust fund, providing insurance and legal background in the case of a dispute., If you have any investment, retirement, or bank accounts that list who will receive the money in case of your death (beneficiaries), this name will take precedence over your will. Call the customer service team of each account and make sure your listed beneficiary is who you want it to be.This applies to life insurance policies and annuities as well.  , A living will can assign a caretaker or decision-maker in the event you cannot make a decision due to mental or physical incapacitation. There are three main parts of end of life care documentation:    Living Will: Outlines treatment you wish to receive or wish to forgo, and under which conditions.Power of Attorney: Designates someone to make health-care choices for you when you are no longer able.Letter of Instruction: Outlines specific end of life instructions, phone numbers and information for bank accounts or insurance, and basic instructions for your family after you've passed. This is not a replacement for a will, but can help in the days immediately after you pass., Funerals are one of the largest single-sum expenses a family will ever pay, ranging from $4,000-6,000. Save your family the hassle by making arrangements ahead of time with a funeral parlor, or by writing down your burial wishes and a maximum cost. If you decide to pre-plan your funeral, make sure you sign a ""fixed cost"" agreement to prevent the funeral parlor from passing on unexpected costs to your relatives., Wills are publicly filed documents that necessarily involve a court of law. Trusts, however, are private, allowing you to distribute your estate over time to whomever you chose. They are generally used for estates larger than half a million dollars, or to hold onto assets until a beneficiary (the person receiving the trust) comes of age. Setting up a living trust may help you distribute your assets without court interference.A trustee is the person who holds on to your assets until they are ready to be passed on. Trusts allow you to put conditions on your gifts, such as ""she inherits it after turning 18,"" or ""only inheritable after all debts are paid.""You will likely need an estate lawyer to help you set up a trust fund.  , Depending on the size of your estate, you may be able to pass down your assets without interference from a court. However, many estates must go through the legal system for heirs to access the assets. The legal process of transferring money from a deceased account to living heirs is called probate.The American Bar Association defines probate as ""the process by which assets are gathered, applied to pay debts, taxes, and expenses of administration, and distributed to those designated as beneficiaries in the will.”Not all estates need to be probated -- there are times when the executor of the will can distribute the estate without court interference.  , The personal representative will be responsible for setting up and administering the estate. Executors and administrators are the formally appointed personal representatives of an estate and have been granted Court authority to act on behalf of the estate. More often than not, the executor has been named in the will.   If the decedent (the person who has died) did not leave a will the family decides who to ask the Court to appoint as administrator(s). The Court may appoint one administrator who is authorized to act alone, two or more administrators who are required to act together, or two or more people authorized to act alone, depending upon the agreement the decedent’s family reaches., Make a list of all the assets and debts in your estate. This includes property, cash, valuables (furniture, antiques, cars, etc.), investment or bank accounts, and debt. If it could be sold for money, it is an asset. You can also higher a professional appraiser to help determine the value of your estate.Gather all financial documents including bills, bank and investment statements, and information on any outstanding loans. Add up all bills, including the payoff amount for any loans or credit cards. Add up the value of the estate assets, including the estimated value of all real estate. You may use the last appraised value of the real estate for estimation purposes. Subtract the total debt from the total assets. This is the estimated value of the probate estate.   , Check your state’s probate code with your attorney to determine your legal responsibilities. An estate which contains assets above your state’s small estate limit, typically $20,000 to $100,000, will need to be probated. If the estate’s assets do not exceed your state’s small estate limit and there is no dispute about who inherits what, you may choose to administer the estate by informal administration, with little to no court involvement.   If the estate’s assets do not exceed your state’s small estate limit, but if there is real estate involved you may be required to set up and administer the estate through the probate courts. Check your state’s probate code or with your attorney for your state’s rules governing small estates. If the estate’s assets do not exceed your state’s small estate limit, but there is any dispute as to whom should inherit property or pay estate debt, you may choose to probate the estate in order to have these issues decided by the Court. In informal administration, when the executor carries out the decedent's wishes, property may be transferred via an affidavit (written, court-confirmed statement) or through summary administration, bills paid by the family in almost any manner agreed upon, and no estate set up., The probate estate consists of all assets which do not pass directly to a new owner. All of these assets must go through a probate court before they are passed on. Assets pass directly to a new owner and skip probate if:   They are jointly titled with another party, such as joint bank accounts or vehicles, which list a co-owner on the title. They are named as a transfer on death beneficiary. A transfer on death beneficiary can be designated on financial accounts, vehicles, and, in some states, real estate. Transfer on death beneficiaries will be listed on the title or deed to the account, vehicle, or property if one has been named. They are named as a beneficiary. A pay on death beneficiary can be designated on financial accounts and life insurance policies. Pay on death beneficiaries are listed on the account or policy if one has been named.","['estate lawyer', 'heirs', 'estate', 'distribution', 'wishes', 'possessions', 'case', 'intent', 'debts', 'probate estate', 'average person', 'executor', 'public records', 'plan', 'trust', 'probate', 'end', 'inventory', 'personal representative', 'children', 'retirement accounts', 'life plans', 'account', 'process', 'assets', 'estate assets', 'intestacy.intestacy rules', 'name guardians', 'age', 'part', 'state', 'advance', 'beneficiary lists', 'funeral arrangements', 'value', 'unsupervised distribution', 'backup plan', 'government']"

"['choose mild-flavored white fish', 'clean and fillet the fish if necessary', 'cut the fish fillets into one inch (2.54 cm) thick slices', 'put the fish stock on the stove to boil', 'place the fish into a food processor or blender', 'use the chop or pulse setting to blend the fish', 'add spices or grated vegetables', 'form oval patties of the fish mixture', 'place the fish patties into the simmering stock', 'cover the pot and cook until the patties are firm', 'use a slotted spoon to remove the gefilte fish once it has cooked']",How to Make Gefilte Fish," Whether you buy whole or filleted, gefilte fish is made with a combination of various freshwater, white-meat fish. Carp, whitefish, pike, grouper, cod, and halibut are used in various recipes. Two parts whitefish and one part pike is a standard combination in many gefilte fish dishes.If you buy from a fishmonger, ask to keep the head, fins, and tail for use in cooking a more traditional fish stock. It’s okay to buy fillets and buy fish stock separately, as well. You also have the option to buy pre-made gefilte fish patties to use in your dish. If you choose to buy gefilte fish in a jar, you won’t need to do anything except heat it up. The amount of fish you need depends on how much gefilte fish you want to make. A relatively small batch requires two to three pounds of fish.; , If you are using freshly caught fish, or whole fish from a butcher or fishmonger, you’ll need to clean, gut, and fillet the fish. This can be a time consuming and messy process, so buying prepared fish is easier.  , Lay the fish on a cutting board and grab a paring knife. Cut the fish across the width into slices that are ½ inch (1.27 cm) to one inch (2.54 cm) thick. You’ll use a blender or food process next, and it works best when you use small slices of fish rather than an entire fillet., While you continue preparing the gefilte fish patties, pour your fish stock into a saucepan to begin heating. Once it boils, turn it to medium heat to simmer until the patties are ready to be cooked. Use fish stock from the store or make your own from scratch.For added flavor, throw some onion, carrots, and celery into the stock while it boils. This is an option based on your personal preference. A good proportion is two large carrots, two sticks of celery, and half of an onion, all chopped. Use a one or two quart (.9-1.9 L) saucepan filled half-full with fish stock.  , Depending on the size of your food processor and the amount of fish you are making, it’s best to not chop it all up at once. Put about half of the fish into the food processor or blender, then repeat the following steps with the second half.   Since gefilte fish is generally made up of multiple types of fish, be sure to place some of each fish into the blender so it forms into a somewhat consistent mixture.  , The chopping part of making gefilte fish can be tricky and isn’t an exact science. Using the available settings, chop the fish so it is blended together and forms a ball. Run the appliance in bursts for 10-30 seconds. Once the fish is chopped, dump it into a mixing bowl.Be careful not to blend the fish for so long that it becomes a paste. A mixture with some chunks of fish is better than a mushy mixture of fish. If your appliance has a blade that is designed for chopping, be sure to use it.  , Gefilte fish is spiced differently by different people, so it’s partly up to your personal taste. Salt and pepper are simple spices used in the dish. Grate some carrots, onions, or parsnip and mix them into the ground fish. Garlic powder is another common spice.Add three to five teaspoons (14.8-24.6 ml) of sugar for sweeter gefilte fish patties. Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of matzo meal for thicker patties. Mix in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of finely grated lemon zest or 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of lemon juice.  , With clean, but still wet, hands, scoop some of the fish mixture out of the bowl. Make balls or oval patties that are about three inches (7.62 cm) long and one inch (2.54 cm) thick. The exact size and shape are up to you.It’s good to keep your hands wet so that the fish mixture doesn’t stick to your hands. Make flat patties or more plump, sausage-like patties.  , Using your hands or a slotted spoon, gently slide the fish patties into the stock. If you use your hands, be careful not to burn yourself. Using a spoon reduces the risk of this happening.  , Put a tight-fitting lid on the pot and allow the patties to simmer. Stir the patties occasionally to make sure they don’t stick to the bottom. Cooking requires a minimum of about 10 minutes, but gefilte fish can be cooked for 25 or 30 minutes, as well.It’s also important to flip them once or twice to make sure both sides cook thoroughly. If you have more patties than you can fit into the saucepan, either use a larger pan, cook the patties in two separate pans, or cook them in two batches.  , When you scoop the patties out of the stock, press a fork into them to make sure they feel firm. Set the cooked patties on a plate to cool. Serve them while they are hot or chill them for later.   Beet horseradish or dill-horseradish mayonnaise are common dipping sauces for gefilte fish. Serve with sliced challah, a traditional bread eaten on Jewish holidays, or with a side of pickles. Store leftovers in the fridge and eat within three to five days of preparation. Storing in the freezer extends the shelf life to about 3 months.","['food processor', 'spices', 'cook', 'blender', 'gefilte fish', 'fish mixture', 'patties', 'fish stock', 'grated vegetables', 'stove', 'fish patties', 'cm', 'fish', 'form oval patties', 'stock', 'mild-flavored white fish', 'thick slices', 'inch', 'pot', 'fish fillets', 'slotted spoon']"
"['cook some pasta according to package directions', 'heat the butter and olive oil in a skillet', 'saute the onion and garlic in the pan', 'add the vodka to the skillet', 'stir the tomato puree into the pan', 'mix the cream into the sauce', 'season the sauce with salt', 'pepper', 'and red pepper flakes', 'save some pasta water to thin the sauce', 'add your pasta to the sauce', 'stir the parmesan cheese into the dish', 'customize your recipe']",How to Make Vodka Sauce," Vodka sauce is traditionally served with penne or rigatoni pasta, though you can use it to top any type of pasta that you like. As you start to prepare the sauce, bring a pot of water to boil on the stove to cook your pasta.Be careful not to overcook your pasta. Test it a minute or two before the instructions say it will be done to see if the texture is right. It should be slightly firm when you taste it because it will continue to cook while you drain it and in the sauce. You don’t necessarily have to use vodka sauce on pasta. It can make a delicious sauce for pizza, chicken, and fish too.; , Set a large skillet or saute pan on the stove, and set the burner to medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil and 2 tablespoons (30 g) of butter, and heat until the butter is completely melted.While the combination of butter and olive oil offers the best flavor for the dish, you can use 4 tablespoons (120 g) of butter by itself or 4 tablespoons (120 mL) of olive oil by itself if you don’t have the other ingredient on hand. You can tell that the oil and butter are at the right temperature when the mixture goes from completely smooth to rippled in the pan.  , When the butter and olive oil is properly heated, add 1 cup (approximately 1 medium onion or 150 g) finely chopped onion 2 to 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the pan. Allow the garlic and onion to cook for approximately 5 minutes, or until the onion becomes soft and slightly brown.Stir the onion and garlic as they cook to ensure that they’re well combined. Watch the pan carefully to ensure that the onion and garlic don’t burn.  , Once the onion and garlic have cooked for several minutes, remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour in ¾ of cup (180 mL) of vodka before returning it to the stove. Stir it into the onion and garlic, and allow the contents to cook for 2 to 3 minutes so the vodka can start to reduce.If you would like a sharper flavor to your sauce, you can add up to 1 cup (240 mL) of vodka. You may want to experiment to see what amount you like best. To reduce the risk of fire, don't pour the vodka directly from the bottle into the pan. Instead, pour it in a measuring cup first and then add it to the pan from the cup. Make sure to have a lid for your pan nearby when you add the vodka. If it ignites, immediately place the lid on the pan to smother and kill the flames.  , When the vodka, onion, and garlic mixture has cooked for a few minutes, it’s time to add the tomato puree to the sauce. Pour one can of puree, approximately 14 ounces (397 g), into the skillet, and stir until all of the contents are thoroughly combined. Reduce the burner’s heat to low.You can swap the tomato puree for a can of tomato sauce, but you’ll wind up with a slightly thinner sauce.  , When the tomato puree is completely mixed with the vodka, onion, and garlic, add 1 cup (240 mL) of heavy cream to the pan. Stir carefully to ensure that it’s fully incorporated into the sauce. Instead of the bright red of the tomato puree, the sauce will now have a creamy light orange color.Make sure that your burner it turned to low. You can burn the sauce very easily at this point. The sauce requires heavy cream to give it the right consistency. Avoid replacing it with whole milk or half-and-half if possible.  , When the cream has been completely stirred into the pan, it’s time to season the sauce. Mix in ¼ to ½ (1.25 to 2.5 g) teaspoon of salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. Add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes too to give the sauce a little heat.Use as much or as little crushed red pepper as you like. If you aren’t a fan of spicy foods, you can omit it entirely.  , If you’ve made pasta to serve with the sauce, make sure to save a cup of the water that you cooked it in just before you drain it. That way, you can use the water to thin the sauce if it turns out to be too thick when you combine it with the pasta.Add just enough pasta water to make the sauce and pasta combination easy to stir together.  , Turn off the burner that the vodka sauce is on, and drain your pasta. Place the hot pasta directly into the pan with sauce and then toss the together to ensure that the pasta is evenly coated.Don’t put all of your cooked pasta into the sauce at once. Instead, add approximately ½ to ¾ and make sure that there is enough sauce to coat all of it. If there’s excess sauce, finish adding the rest of your pasta. You should have enough sauce for approximately six servings of pasta.  , When the vodka sauce and pasta are fully combined, mix in 1 cup (450 g) of grated Parmesan cheese. For serving, you can top the pasta and sauce with a little more grated cheese.You can also garnish your pasta and vodka sauce with some fresh basil leaves for added color.  , While pasta and vodka sauce is a common dish, you can customize the recipe to suit your tastes. You may want to add some type of protein to the dish to make a hearty meal, or mix in some vegetables for added flavor.   Grilled chicken, sausage, and shrimp can be tasty addition to your pasta and vodka sauce. Cook approximately 1 pound (450 g) of your chosen meat or seafood fully, and then top each bowl of pasta and sauce with it. You may want to drizzle additional vodka sauce over the protein. Peas pair well with vodka sauce. When the sauce is nearly finished, add 1 cup (150 g) fresh or defrosted peas to heat them through.

Firm ground shoes usually have ten or more long studs that are distributed evenly throughout the bottom rim of the shoe. They provide a sufficient amount of traction for normal playing conditions. The studs can either be conical or blade shaped.   Conical studs are rounded at the bottom. They allow a player to have flexibility of motion. Blade shaped studs become thinner at the bottom of the shoe. They’re designed to dig into the pitch and give a player better traction. However, they don’t offer quite as much flexibility as conical studs because it’s harder to remove them from the ground.Firm ground shoes are the safest shoes to buy if you don’t know what type of field you’ll be playing on. They’re considered acceptable for many different playing conditions.; , If you’ll be playing on a pitch where it rains often you’ll need to wear a pair of soft ground cleats. The studs on a soft ground cleat are similar to those on a firm ground cleat. However, there is usually only about six of them and they are strategically placed so the shoe can offer maximum traction.   The studs on a soft ground cleats can also be conical or blade shaped. On soft ground shoes, there will be two blades in the back of the shoe on either side of the heel and four blades positioned on the front of the shoe (two on either side about an inch from each other) to maintain balance. Soft ground shoes should only be used on soft surfaces. Wearing them in other conditions can lead to injury., Hard ground shoes are designed to give players traction and balance on surfaces where much of the grass has been worn down leaving only the rigid ground beneath it. The bottom of a hard ground cleats is covered in small, flat studs. Unlike those of firm ground and soft ground cleats, the studs on a hard ground cleat are spread out over the entire bottom of the shoe.   Hard ground cleats are not designed to dig into the ground. Rather, they offer grip to help a player balance on a solid surface. Their names may sound similar, but hard ground shoes are not appropriate for firm ground pitches.  , Many soccer leagues are starting to play on turf. It’s easy and cheap to maintain and it stays the same in almost every kind of weather. If turf cleats have studs at all, they’ll be very tiny and spread out over the entire bottom of the shoe. Rather than studs, they may simply have a slightly elevated pattern on the bottom that allows them to offer traction on the turf.Don’t wear turf cleats on any other surface than turf. They don’t have studs long or sharp enough to grip different surfaces.  , If you’re a forward, your main concern on the pitch is to score goals. You’ll need a shoe with a clean strike zone so you can connect with the ball effectively. The strike zone of a soccer cleat is the part that ideally should make contact with the ball. The strike zone or vamp of the shoe is located on the upper front part of the shoe.As a forward, you may also want to get lighter shoes so you can make explosive movements. Look for shoes that weigh anywhere from five to eight ounces.  , If you're a midfielder, you’ll spend most of a match running up and down the field. You’ll need shoes that won’t irritate your feet after spending ninety minutes sprinting back and forth. Make sure you pick shoes with comfortable insoles and midsoles in them with plenty of support for your heels.The insoles are the soft cushions inside of the shoes. Some soccer cleats have removable insoles. The midsoles are cushions that are built into the shoe.  , If you have a defensive position, your shoes will take a lot of punishment. Get shoes with a tough outsole that can withstand the damage. You’ll need to be able to stop on a dime and change directions easily while tracking opposing forwards. Consider getting shoes with great traction.   You might also want your shoes to have a large strike zone for clearing the ball effectively. The outsole is the bottom of the shoe that takes damage as you start and stop.  , If you’re a keeper, traction will be the most important part of your shoe. Find shoes that can handle your back and forth motion.You’ll need to be able to dig in your feet and jump from side to side easily. A sizable strike zone will also will also benefit your ability to perform kick-outs and back passes.  , Soccer cleats can be made from a variety of different fabrics. High quality kangaroo leather cleats will mold to your feet after playing in them for a while and they are very durable. However, they are a bit heavier than shoes made from synthetic materials. On the other hand, shoes made using mesh are usually very light weight, but they’re not good for playing in wet conditions as they can allow water to seep into your socks. Try on shoes made from a few different materials before deciding which one you like.Cleats made from calf or goat leather are less expensive than ones made from kangaroo leather and can give you a similar feel. Some companies are developing synthetic leather strains in response to animal activists. The benefit of artificial leather is that different qualities, like water resistance, can be added to the material.  , You want your shoes to feel snug, but not too tight. There should be about the width of a baby’s finger between your toe and the front of your shoe. If you can feel your toes scraping against the front of the shoe, then they’re too small. If you can fit your entire thumb between your toes and the front, then the shoes are too big.If you have wide feet, you might have to do some searching for shoes that fit you comfortably. Different brands make shoes for different foot widths. For example: Nike designs very thin shoes while Adidas makes shoes that are a little wider. Wearing shoes that don’t fit you properly can be very painful in a soccer match and can give you blisters on your feet. Long term, they can even cause bunions to form.  , If you plan on playing soccer competitively, you should purchase shoes that are either top-tier or mid-tier as far as quality. The top-tier cleats are the ones that the pros wear. They’re designed to accommodate peak performance play. However, they’re not built to last as professional soccer players often get new shoes every few matches. Mid-tier shoes are cheaper, more durable and often offer performance that is close to that of top-tier shoes.Top-tier shoes usually cost one hundred and fifty dollars or more. Mid-tier shoes range from eighty to one hundred and fifty dollars. Low-tier shoes cost from forty to eighty dollars and should only be worn if you’re playing soccer for fun. Be careful about buying shoes that are originally priced under forty dollars. The quality is often very poor and can increase your risk of injury.  , Modern soccer cleats don’t always have their shoelaces in the center. Some cleats are being designed with their laces toward the outside of the shoe to create a larger strike zone. If you’re used to your laces being central, it can take some time to get used to having them on the side. The lace placement can alter the fit and feeling of the shoe.   If you like your cleats to feel tight, you may want to stick with central laces. Side laced shoes can have a looser feel.

Even one bulky e-mail could significantly increase the size of the entire file, or a problem with a single email could make the entire database corrupt or unusable.; , The issues related to MBOX are most prominent while importing MBOX files into Apple Mail. Some of the most common errors while importing MBOX files into Apple Mail are as follows:   ""Some messages could not be imported; the partially imported mailboxes are located in the mailbox named ""import"" in the mailboxes list."" ""Your Mail Index has been corrupted"". This message usually appears after updating to Mavericks OS. You might face a situation where Mail messages suddenly go blank.  , There are several means to tackle such errors. Depending upon the severity of the error, there are different types of fixes, ranging from a simple rebuild to complex recovery operations. The total time taken to fix such issues depends solely upon the level of damage and the number of email messages with the folder.  , This is the simplest solution to get rid of any unwanted files clustered in the mailbox folders. You can also use this option to rebuild a mailbox to update the list of messages it has. For example, in case of missing or garbled messages you can use this option. In order to rebuild the mailbox:   Open the Apple Mail e-mail client. Select the folders to be rebuilt Click Mailbox -> Rebuild Note: Locally stored messages and attachments are discarded, when you rebuild mailboxes for IMAP and Exchange accounts. In addition, the messages and attachments are downloaded again from the server to your Mac.

Employers also have the means to monitor whether you are ‘online’ during office hours, especially if they are your ‘friend’ or ‘connection’ online.  , While you may think that only your friends see what you post, if a potential employer, or your current employer, does happen to see that you post something using slang or derogatory language could affect your job opportunities.   Try to limit the number of pictures that show you with a drink in your hand, and do not post any photos of you participating in illegal drugs.

Giving your girlfriend a compliment lets her know what you admire and love about her. When giving her a compliment, try to make it as specific as possible. Think about what is unique about her. A specific compliment will be remembered longer and appreciated more than a general compliment that could be given to anyone.Say things like “I really like the outfit you have put together today,” or “I’m really impressed by your taste in books.” Think about something you haven’t complimented her on before. Maybe she does a great job of handling all of her responsibilities. If she has gotten her hair done recently, notice it and compliment it. You don’t have to constantly compliment her. Too many compliments can seem insincere after a while. If your girlfriend is insecure about certain things, like her body or looks, compliment her to raise her confidence about them.; , Talking about your emotions can be difficult to do, but it will almost always be appreciated. Expressing your emotions about the relationship will vary depending on the type of relationship and how long you have been together. Tell her that you love her, appreciate what she does, and value her in your life. Let her know how she has made you better as a person.If is a fairly new relationship, you can say “I’m so happy I’ve been able to get to know you. I hope I can get to know you even more as our relationship progresses.” It never hurts to let your girlfriend know how much you appreciate having her in her life, even if it is an established relationship.  , Making the effort to include your girlfriend in your plans and daily life means a lot. You don’t have to fully include her into every part of your life if it is a new relationship. Choose what you include her in based on what you are comfortable with and how serious the relationship is. If it is a new relationship, ask her to hang out with your friends during the weekend. If you are more serious, bring her to family functions or on a trip.What you include her in doesn’t have to be that important or serious. It is just as nice to invite her to run errands with her. Letting her know you think of her and want her around is what counts.  , Remembering the small things sometimes means just as much as remembering the big things. This is because it is surprising and shows how much you pay attention to her, her life, and your relationship. Pay attention to the small events and remarks, like something she says she likes or doesn’t like, a childhood memory that means a lot to her, or remember the details about how you met her.You can also remember her favorite movies, songs, books, and/or plays and watch or read them with her later. Remember the details about the relationship. For example, remember where you first held hands, first kissed, or a favor she did for you that meant a lot to you.  , Remembering the small things means a lot, but it is also very important to not forget the big dates. Forgetting a big date can result in hurt feelings and possible an argument because those dates are expected to be remembered. A few important dates to remember are your anniversary, her birthday, and holidays, especially her favorite holidays.Show her dates like her birthday and Valentine’s Day are important to you by planning a celebration or date. Make sure you don’t forget dates by writing them in a planner or calendar or putting them into the calendar on your mobile phone.  , Your girlfriend doesn’t have to determine what you do and don’t do in your life, but it is thoughtful to ask for her opinion. It shows that you value what she thinks, and you want to apply your advice in your decisions. You can ask for her opinion for something as simple as choosing what shirt to wear, or as big as moving to another location.Ask her something like “I’m thinking of getting a new shirt. Would you like to help me pick it out? I would like your opinion.” You don’t have to only ask for her opinion on something personal. You can also ask for her advice on entertainment, the news, or whatever comes to mind. You can ask her opinion, but you don’t have to take it if you don’t think it is beneficial to you. Only do what makes you feel happy and comfortable.  , You should listen to anyone that is speaking, but try to pay special attention to what your girlfriend is saying. Truly listening is not as common as it should be, so your girlfriend will appreciate having someone to rely on to listen to her. You don’t have always have to answer to what she is saying. Having someone to vent to is special.Look her into her eyes when she is speaking. If she is venting or working something out aloud, let her talk. You can show that you are listening by nodding occasionally and making small comments like “I understand.” Of course, you should respond when she asks something.  , Respond to her when you are having a conversation, but also respond to her when you talk through messages throughout the day. Acknowledge when she is speaking to you, even if it is a small question or comment that warrants a response. Respond to her carefully and with thought if it is a serious conversation. You should also try your best to respond to her when she texts, messages, or calls you.Don’t go out of your way to respond if the time is not appropriate, like when you are in class or at work. Respond to her when you can. She should understand that you are not always immediately available.  , You don’t have to be constantly connected with each other, but sending her a few texts and/or messages throughout the day goes a long way. It will mean a lot to her to know that you cross her mind even when you are apart. Text her when you see something that makes you think of her, or even just to say hello.You can also send her random text messages reminding her how you beautiful you think she is and that you love her.  , Calling is less common these days because texting and messaging through social media is easier and faster. Taking the time to call her will show that you value conversation with her, not just brief snippets of conversation through text. You can call her when you have a few minutes to spare throughout the day, or you can call her at night to have a longer conversation when you are not together.It is also nice to call her and say you just wanted to hear her voice. If she does not answer, leave a message or send a text to let her know that you were thinking of her.  , Show her and speak to her with respect at all times. Do not call her bad names, even if it’s in jest. Avoid speaking negatively about her gender or make inappropriate jokes that could hurt her feelings. Never dismiss what she is saying, even if you are having an argument. If you are having an argument, try to think before you speak and avoid saying things you will regret later.If you are arguing, instead of resorting to name-calling or other negative language, say something like “I respect what you are saying, but I disagree. Can we try to come to a compromise?” You don’t have to walk on eggshells when speaking to her. Just try to consider if it will hurt her feelings before saying what you have in mind. Speaking to her with respect also involves respecting her interests and wishes. Even if you think ballet isn’t your thing, support her. If she tells you that you’re doing something that makes her uncomfortable, stop doing it.  , It is important to show your love through actions and kind words, but simply saying “I love you” never gets old. Tell her you love her every day, or whenever you feel the need to tell her. You can say it in person, through text, or by phone, though saying it in person is the most ideal way to say it. Don’t be afraid to tell her you love her if you have never told her before. It’s best to wait until you have been in a relationship with her for a while, but it is not wrong to express your feelings at any point. Don’t expect her to say it back, though. If she doesn’t say it back, it doesn’t mean that she won’t say it in the future.  , Holding hands with your girlfriend is a simple and sweet gesture that never gets old. It is an innocent gesture that is physical without being overly physical. Hold her hand while you are watching a movie. Take her hand as you walk down the street together. It will show that you are proud that she is your girlfriend.It’s okay if she expresses a dislike for holding hands. There are plenty of other ways to show affection.  , A hug is a bit more physical than holding hands, but it is usually appreciated. Always give her a hug when saying hello or goodbye. Unexpected hugs are great too. Give her a quick hug when you or out together, or give her a longer hug when you are spending time alone.If she says that she doesn’t like long hugs in public or during specific times, respect that and ask when physical affection is okay with her.  , A kiss is a simple act that can be powerful in showing her how you feel about her. If it is a new relationship, it can still be a new and exciting thing every time you kiss. Even if you kiss her regularly now, you can probably kiss her more often. Kissing is something that often becomes neglected in longer relationships. Pull her in and surprise her with a kiss. Or, kiss her somewhere other than her lips, like on her forehead, nose, or neck.Kiss her in public to show off how proud you are that she is yours. Don’t feel pressured to kiss if you haven’t done it yet. Take things at a pace that you and your girlfriend are comfortable with.  , A massage after a long, stressful day is a thoughtful gesture. Massage her neck, back, or feet. You can also ask her where she would like to be massaged. Use your bare hands or add oils or lotions. You should massage her to help her unwind. Do not give her the massage with any expectations or ulterior motives.Massages can also be a method of seduction, but only do this if both you and your partner are comfortable and have talked about a sexual relationship.  , You can continue dating your girlfriend, even when you are in a relationship. Regularly go one dates with her to the movies, park, or dinner. A date doesn’t have to cost anything to be enjoyed. It’s the thought that matters. You can also plan a special date for her. It can be just because or for an occasion. Keep in mind her interests and things you enjoy doing together when planning a date.Going on a hike to someplace beautiful is a great way to spend time together without spending too much money. Cook her dinner and plan to watch her favorite movie. The effort will mean more than taking her out to a fancy restaurant.  , You do not have to constantly give her gifts, but it is thoughtful to give her a surprise gift or a gift for a special occasion. You can make her a gift, like a painting or scrapbook with photos and memories of your relationship. It is also an option to make the gift something that you can do together, like attending a ballet or sports game she has dreamed of going to.Keep in mind things that she points or mentions that she would like to have. Write them down to remember them. A great gift can be something like writing a poem or song to her.  , The small, mundane things are important too because they occur far more often than special occasions. If she is having a busy day, help her clean her room, kitchen, or bathroom. Offer to clean or do laundry for her, or make it something you can do together. Run a simple errand for her, like picking up milk if she ran out of it. You can also make a day of running errands together.   Spend a free day during the weekend catching up on each other’s errands, like getting groceries, paying bills, and shopping.  , Exploring new places and parts of life is a great bonding experience that will strengthen your relationship. It can be something neither of you have done, or something only one of you haven’t experienced before. You can get ideas for what to do by listening to her talk about things she would like to experience, or you can do something that is meaningful to you or her.Take a road trip to a place neither of you have visited before. Taking trips together is a good way of getting to know your girlfriend or boyfriend better, even if you have been together for a while. Maybe seeing The Nutcracker is a cherished part of her childhood, but you have never been. That is something you can do together. If going to see a baseball team is something you love but she has never gone to a game, invite her to go with you.  , Show up to events that she takes part in. It might be a work event, wedding, game, or show. Supporting her in whatever she does will show how much you care for her. You can also invite her to events in her life. Letting her know that you want her there for support is a good way of showing that she is a part of your life.Ask her before attending a game or show she is performing in if she is shy. Surprise her by showing up if you think it will make her happy. Accept her invitation if possible if she invites you to an event. If you can’t go, tell her that you wish you could and express your disappointment. Send her flowers or a note the day of the event to show encouragement from afar.

When your dog is well trained, he will understand how he should to relate to you and other household members (his ‘pack’). You can train your dog to do many things, such as sit, stay, and come when called.   Other forms of training include leash training and crate training. Keep in mind that training your dog is not about showing him that you are dominant to him in the pack. In fact, interacting with your dog from a position of dominance could actually weaken your bond with him and increase his stress and anxiety.Obedience classes are a great way to train your dog. Training your dog will require your time and patience. It may take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to train him.; , In addition to formal training, creating a clear set of rules for your dog will help him understand how he should relate to his pack. The rules you set are up to you and should reflect how you want your dog to behave in your home.For example, you can establish a rule that your dog cannot sit on the furniture.   You can also set rules about where your dog can sleep (on the floor rather than on your bed),and how he should wait to be fed (sitting instead of jumping up and down). As with formal training, these rules will teach your dog how to be a well-behaved member of the pack. The better your dog understands the rules of the house, the less anxious he will be, and the less likely he will develop behavior problems., Reinforcing the rules is key to helping your dog understand how he is supposed to behave. Positive reinforcement (e.g., verbal praise, treats, extra playtime) is an effective way to reinforce the rules by rewarding only good behavior. Your dog will recognize that good behavior brings rewards, and will thus perform the behaviors for which he will be rewarded.Positive reinforcement should be immediate when your dog performs the desired behavior (e.g., sitting before he eats). Immediate reinforcement will help your dog establish an association between good behavior and reward.Positive reinforcement should also be consistent. The more consistent the reward, the better your dog will understand how to behave., Rewarding your dog for following the rules is one side of the coin—making the breaking of the rules undesirable is the other side. One way to create an undesirable consequence is to ignore your dog when he misbehaves. Because your dog does not want to be ignored,he will choose to follow the rules and get your attention, rather than break the rules and risk being ignored.   Deterrent devices, such as upside-down mousetraps and motion-activated bottles of compressed air,are available that will discourage the bad behavior without hurting your dog. A firm ‘No’ is often effective.  Do not reinforce the rules through physical or verbal abuse. This will likely instill fear in your dog, rather than teach him good behavior., Consistency is key to teaching your dog how to behave properly. For example, when training your dog to follow basic commands, reward him each time he responds correctly. Likewise, correct his bad behavior each time he misbehaves.Consistency also involves giving the same cue for a command. For example, if you say 'down' on one occasion when your want dog off the couch, then say 'off' another time, he will be confused about which command to follow.Make sure that you and other household members train and correct your dog in the same way. Each person should say the same commands, and reinforce the rules in the same way.Without consistency, your dog will be confused as to when his behavior is desirable and when it is not.  , Your dog should feel like he is loved and supported by the members of his pack. One way to show him this support is to take him with you when you go places.For example, let him ride in the car with you when you run errands.If practical, let him travel with you when you go on a trip. Your dog wants to spend time with his pack, so involving him in your life activities will make him feel welcome.  , On any given day, your dog probably has some pent-up energy that he needs to release. Exercising not only lets him release that energy, but it can also be a time for you to bond with him. For example, play fetch with your dog—it's an easy game that can keep him happily entertained with his interaction with you.   Walking or running with your dog is a great way to exercise your dog. If you have a working dog, like a Husky, foster his love of work (e.g., pulling you in a wheelbarrow).Choosing exercises that allow interaction between you and your dog will make him feel like he's a part of the pack.  , Making your dog feel welcome in the pack should be a family affair. If it helps, create a schedule for each each family member to take care of your dog's needs (e.g. walking, grooming, feeding).When everyone participates in your dog's care, he will feel supported by his pack.   Training should also be a family affair. When everyone knows how your dog is being trained, and is consistent with giving commands and reinforcing the rules, your dog will likely feel comfortable and confident in his pack.  , Showing your dog affection is a good way for him to feel supported by his pack. However, indiscriminate affection will overindulge your dog, and will not help him understand how to be a good member of the pack. Show affection only when your dog is behaving properly (e.g. sitting before eating)., Dominance-based training uses the premise that a dog is trying to assume a leadership position over his owner, thus requiring the owner to show his or her dog who is in charge.However, dogs generally do not try to assert their leadership or take charge.Therefore, trying to show your dog that he is lower than you in the pack is not only ineffective, but could create an adversarial relationship between you and him.Because your dog is not trying to compete with you, the concept of dominance is not considered to be relevant to living and working with dogs., Although leash pulling is undesirable, it is not an assertion of dominance. In fact, how your dog walks on a leash is rarely a reflection of your relationship to him.More than likely, the leash pulling is indicative of him not knowing how to walk properly on a leash.Proper leash training should effectively address this bad behavior.  , Unless you have an unneutered male dog who urinates to mark territory, improper urination is usually a sign of inadequate housetraining or urinary system disease. If you have already housetrained your dog, but he continues to urinate in the house, take him to your veterinarian for a medical examination.If your veterinarian rules out disease as the underlying cause of your dog’s inappropriate urination, you may need to housetrain him again. You may also need to be more attuned to his cues that he needs to relieve himself. Taking him outside and rewarding him immediately after he relieves himself will reinforce this good behavior., Barking is commonly misinterpreted as your dog trying to assert his dominance. Rather, he may be barking out of boredom, fear, or anxiety.If your dog is barking because he is bored, you can train him to bark only on command.   Fear- or anxiety-based barking may be more challenging to address. Your dog may have developed a genuine fear of someone or a particular situation, and may bark to signal his distress. Consider seeking the expertise of a veterinary behaviorist if your dog barks out of fear or anxiety., If your dog is trying to eat before you, he is not trying to show that he is in control of your kitchen.Instead, he may just be scavenging—a natural dog behavior.If your dog sees food, regardless of whether it is on your plate or on the countertop, he will probably try to eat it.You can discourage this scavenging behavior by keeping him out of the kitchen while you are preparing food.You could also train him to sit while you eat or prepare food. Keep in mind that your dog does not see himself as submissive to you if you make him wait to eat until after you finish.In doing this, you are teaching him good eating behavior, not that you are above him in the pack.  , Dog behaviors such as running through a doorway ahead of you, ignoring your command to come when called, and jumping up are sometimes interpreted as assertions of dominance.Although undesirable, these behaviors are not challenges to your leadership. Rather, they can indicate playfulness, natural canine behavior, or a lack of training.   The website https://apdt.com/pet-owners/choosing-a-trainer/dominance/ has a comprehensive list of behaviors that are commonly misinterpreted as dominant. Becoming familiar with this list will help you understand your dog’s behavior, as well as learn how to correct the behavior.

"['lay out the costume clothing', 'create a draft of stick figure pattern', 'attach the glow sticks', 'create the head of the costume', 'crack the glow sticks']",How to Make a Glow Stick Costume," The clothing for this costume must be all black. The black clothing will give the allusion that there’s nothing behind the glow sticks (creating the appearance of a genuine stick figure), and the glow sticks will appear to glow brighter with the contrasting black background. Lay the top and bottoms on a flat surface such as a floor or table.The type of clothing used for the costume can be anything black, such as leggings, sweat pants, hoodies, turtlenecks, etc.; , On a sheet of paper, draw a couple different styles of stick figures to brainstorm what kind a pattern you want to create for your costume.Stick figure patterns are relatively simple in nature, but by sketching out a rough plan for your costume, you’ll have a better idea on how to position the glow sticks and how many glow sticks you’ll need. Err on the side of caution and get more glow sticks than you think you may need. Aim for approximately 50 glow sticks for both the back and front of the costume. This will be beneficiary if any of the glow sticks break, don’t glow, or if you want to make more patterns.  , While the costume clothing is laid flat, assemble the glow sticks on top of the clothing to make the stick figure pattern. Generally, a straight line of glow sticks span from the neck area of the clothing, to the waist of the pants. Then, glow sticks lead off on both the top and bottom ends of the middle section of sticks, to create the arms and legs of the stick figure. When your glow sticks are in the pattern you want for the costume, use clear packaging tape to secure the glow sticks to the clothing.Stick the tape on the glow sticks lengthwise, so the entire glow stick is covered in tape. Do not crack the glow sticks at this time.   When the front of the costume is finished, turn the clothing over and tape glow sticks on to the back of the clothing.Try to have all of the glow stick ends touching each other in the pattern. This arrangement will help make the stick figure look like it is made of one continuous line rather than a bunch of dashed lines.  , If you decide to wear a black hoodie for the top portion of the costume, consider decorating the rim of the hood with glow sticks in order to make a “head” for the stick figure. If you aren’t wearing a hoodie or don’t want to assemble the glow sticks that way, use the plastic connector pieces of the glow sticks to create a circled necklace of sticks. Then, consider taping the circle to your forehead, or using sturdy hair clips to attach the circle onto the hair on your head.Remember, you want to make a head for the back of the costume too. If you’re wearing a hoodie, you can tape the top of the circle necklace to the back of the hood. If you aren’t wearing a hoodie, use clips to attach the circle to your hair at the top of the back of your head. If you clip the circle onto your hair, the circle will be around your face with a little bit of your actual face poking through the hole of the circle.  , When you’re ready to wear the costume, bend all the glow sticks to crack the inside that starts the glow in the dark chemical reaction. Try not to undo any of the taping as you bend the glow sticks.   The glow sticks tend to only glow for about six hours, so crack them as late as possible so the glow lasts throughout the night.","['head', 'glow', 'costume clothing', 'stick figure pattern', 'costume', 'draft']"
"['use a low calorie sweetener', 'substitute skim milk', 'stir in a healthy creamer', 'request extra foam', 'avoid syrupy shots', 'skip the whipped cream', 'choose your toppings carefully']",How to Reduce Calories in Coffee Drinks1," Replace teaspoons of sugar added directly into your coffee with a low calorie or no-calorie sweetener, such as Splenda. Follow the directions on the package regarding serving size and resist the urge to add extra. You can also request this substitution when ordering at a coffee shop.It is best to choose sweeteners that do not list “aspartame” as one of the ingredients. Aspartame has been the subject of concern as a potential contributor to cancer. It can also cause headaches in some people when consumed in products that contain it, such as Equal.You can also cut down on calories by gradually reducing your use of sweetener until you eliminate it altogether. Do this by adding just a little bit less to your coffee each day.; , Using whole milk adds flavor but it also packs on the calories. Instead, go “skinny” and opt for skim milk or low-fat milk instead. Be aware that if you order in some coffee shops this swap may not be a possibility as they use premixed packages for certain drinks, especially seasonal ones.Drink milk substitutes, such as soy or coconut milk, only in moderate amounts as they can contain high levels of sugars.It’s not necessary to remove milk products entirely from your coffee. In fact, milk has been shown to offset the calcium that coffee pulls out from your system.However, the amount of calcium coffee pulls from your system is very small, so just 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk is enough to offset it., Read the labels on your store bought creamers paying particular attention to the calories, fats, and sugar content. Buy a creamer that is made with artificial sweeteners. It may also help to move away from creamers that use a half-and-half type substance as their base.   Especially watch the ‘holiday flavored’ creamers as they are often loaded down with sugars and highly processed ingredients resulting in a higher calorie count. If you want a more healthy option, make your own creamer at home. Stir skim milk, cinnamon, and artificial sweetener in a saucepan until it simmers. Let it cool and refrigerate between uses., Light, foamy drinks are less calorically dense. The foam takes up the space in the cup where more liquid could be. Turn your attention toward a cappuccino with extra foam instead of your traditional latte. You could cut 40 calories just by making this exchange., If you are out at a coffeehouse, request that the barista put one less shot or pump of flavoring or syrup into your cup. Keep lowering this number each time you visit until most of the extra shot calories are removed. You can save right around 70 calories a shot with this request., If you make coffee at home, simply stop buying whipped cream at the store. If you are at a restaurant, request that they “hold the whipped cream” when they make your drink. Whipped cream is a staple with most specialty coffees but it can add between 80-120 calories per cup.You might also ask your barista if whipped cream is mixed in to the drink itself. If this is the case, make sure they know to not do that for your drink.  , A ‘pretty’ cup of coffee is always wonderful to look at, but it can pack o the calories. Ask your barista to skip the syrupy or chocolatey topping. Or, you can ask them to just use half the typical amount. One tablespoon of a chocolate drizzle syrup can contain up to 50 calories.If you are at home, experiment with some healthy toppings. For example, lightly sprinkle cinnamon or nutmeg on your drink instead of a heavier syrup. You will get an extra flavor kick without the calorie consequences.","['low calorie sweetener', 'request extra foam', 'substitute skim milk', 'healthy creamer', 'syrupy shots', 'cream', 'toppings']"
"['drink herbal tea', 'use ginger', 'take feverfew', 'add rosemary to meals', 'use lemon balm', 'use st john’s wort']",How to Get Rid of a Headache Naturally3," Herbal teas contain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help relieve stress and soothe sore muscles. Some teas can take up to 2–3 hours to take effect.Herbal teas that help reduce the symptoms associated with headaches are:   For headaches accompanied by nausea or anxiety, use 1/2 teaspoon dried peppermint and 1/2 teaspoon dried chamomile flowers in 1 cup of warm water (80-85 C). Drink 1-2 cups, as needed during the day until your headache decreases. For headaches accompanied by insomnia, try Valerian tea. Infuse 1/2 teaspoon of valerian in 1 cup of warm water before sleeping.Be aware that valerian has several drug interactions. Talk to your doctor before trying valerian, especially if you are taking naloxone or buprenorphine.  , Ginger can help reduce symptoms of anxiety, nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure and digestive problems that may accompany some headaches, thus reducing the severity of the headache. Studies have shown that ginger can also help reduce the chances of migraines.Ginger extract is also available in dietary capsules or as oil at most nutrition food stores. Ginger can be a strong herb, therefore the recommended daily intake is 4 grams, including dietary sources. Pregnant women should not take more than 1 gram of ginger per day.Do not take ginger if you have a bleeding disorder or if you are taking blood-thinning medications, including aspirin., Research shows that feverfew is an effective medicine for preventing or stopping migraine headaches. Feverfew supplements are available fresh, freeze-dried, or dried. They can be purchased as capsules, tablets, or liquid extracts. Feverfew supplements should contain at least 0.2% parthenolide, a natural compound found in the herb. The recommended daily intake is 50–100 mg once or twice daily. Some precautions to remember are:   People with allergies to chamomile, ragweed, or yarrow may be allergic to feverfew and should not take it. Feverfew may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if you take blood-thinning medications. Ask your doctor before taking feverfew if you take blood-thinners. Pregnant and nursing women as well as children under 2 should not take feverfew. If you are scheduled for surgery, be sure to tell your doctor if you are taking feverfew. It may interact with anesthesia. Do not stop taking feverfew abruptly if you have used it for more than 1 week. Gradually lower the dose before stopping use. Stopping feverfew too quickly may cause rebound headache, anxiety, fatigue, muscle stiffness, and joint pain., Rosemary is widely used as a spice when cooking, especially in Mediterranean dishes. Rosemary has been used medicinally to improve memory, relieve muscle pains and spasms, improve digestion and support the circulatory and nervous systems.   Do not exceed 4 - 6 grams of rosemary per day. Any more and it may cause dehydration or hypotension. It can also act as an abortifacient. , Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) is an herb often used to reduce stress and anxiety, promote sleep, improve appetite, and ease muscle pain and discomfort from indigestion. It is also often combined with other calming, soothing herbs, such as valerian and chamomile to help promote relaxation.   Lemon balm is available as a dietary capsule supplement with a recommendation of 300–500 mg, 3 times daily or as needed. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult with a doctor before using lemon balm.Lemon balm should not be taken by anyone with hyperthyroid disease.  , People with migraine, cluster, or post-traumatic headaches are at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety, depression, mood swings, and personality changes. St. John’s wort is an herb used to treat mild to moderate depression. It is available as a liquid extract, capsules, tablets and commercial tea. Ask your doctor which will be right for you.   Supplements are standardized at 0.3% hypericin concentration, one of the active compounds in the herb, and should be taken three times daily in 300mg doses. It may take 3–4 weeks to show significant improvements. Don’t stop taking St. John’s wort all at once, because that may cause unpleasant side effects. Gradually lower the dose before stopping.Some precautions to remember are: If your headaches get worse, discontinue use. People with ADD (attention deficit disorder) and bipolar disorder should not use St. John’s wort. Do not use St. John’s wort if you are taking medications such as antidepressants, sedatives, birth control pills or allergy drugs. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not use St. John’s wort. St. John’s wort should not be used to treat severe depression. If you experience thoughts of aggression or suicide, you should see a doctor immediately.","['drink herbal tea', 'meals', 'use ginger', 'feverfew', 'wort', 'use st john', 'rosemary', 'use lemon balm']"

Take the pressure off of your writing days by recording ideas all day, every day. From lines you overhear that make you laugh to sudden stories that burst into your mind, keep track of ideas throughout the day, not just when you sit at the computer.; , There are no completely original ideas in writing -- everything builds off of other work, real life events, and new combinations of other art forms to form something ""new"" from the old. But this is incredibly freeing, allowing you to experiment and play with crazy new ideas and combinations to make something no one has quite seen before.    House was a brilliant, but simple combination of medical dramas with one-off ""murder mystery"" type shows, swapping medical diagnosis for detective work.  Star Wars is a typical hero's quest, with the plot ripped straight from the oldest known Greek stories. George Lucas's genius? Simply setting it in space. The collected works of William Shakespeare are full of ""artistic theft,"" as almost every one of his plays was a brilliant amalgamation of other plays, books, and historical records.  , Pay attention to the news, read a biography that catches your eye, and watch documentaries and series. What sorts of issues, stories, and ideas grab you? Are there perspectives that would be fun to write from, or that you've never heard from creatively? The world around you is filled with inspiration, so use it.   Try writing from the perspective of the people you see on the news. You understand the facts of a war or struggle, but try to actually imagine living it. Creative writing doesn't have to be fiction. What stories from your life speak out to you as potentially exciting or compelling stories.  , This isn't for every writer, but everyone should at least try group writing or brainstorming. It usually works best when someone brings an initial idea in: ""what if the Terracotta warriors were really alive,"" allowing everyone to pitch in ideas and build on the initial idea until it's built into a story worth telling.   Almost all writers enjoy having at least one person to bounce ideas off. Frequently, just vocalizing your plots or ideas can make them much clearer and easier to write.  , Just start typing, and don't let yourself stop for at least five minutes. Write everything that comes to mind, following ideas and threads until you get distracted or bored, then write about something else. This doesn't have to turn into anything -- rather, free writing is the equivalent of stretching for athletes. You get out of your head and onto the page-- the first step towards getting your writing groove going.   Look online at collections of ""free writing prompts."" There are thousands of ideas out there to spark your creative juices and get the writing flowing, even if only for a few minutes. Rewrite passages from your favorite books -- many famous authors, from Billy Collins to Cormac McCarthy, literally re-wrote favorite chapters to learn from the best.","['group', 'computer', 'ideas', 'documentaries', 'small notebook', 'type something', 'close friend', 'non-fiction books', 'phone', 'characters', 'real-world inspiration']"

Don't go around telling lots of people about it or your idea might be stolen. In selecting a mentor, be sure that this person is trustworthy and has no reason to undermine your attempts at starting out. More than this, be sure to choose someone who is positive, upbeat, and motivating. There is nothing more off-putting than someone whose negativity about your proposals! Ignore the naysayers, those who provide the figures of failed businesses; that's negativity you can do without.; , The mentor must be good at running a business inside out, from the bottom to the top. Your mentor should have at least 10 years experience in the business field and have a track record that shines. Note how this person has overcome failures too; if they bounced back and did even better, this person is ideal!  , It's no good bagging a great mentor only to never see him or her. Check straight away if they can spare a couple of hours a week for a month or two to sit down together and run through all of the issues. Always be prepared to shout them coffee, a meal, etc. because this person is doing you an enormous favor. If they seek payment from you, that's fine too; negotiate a fair deal and include as part of your start-up costs – view it as insurance for the security of the future business.  , While you won't be able to access the Richard Bransons and Estee Lauders of the world unless you've got personal friendships with them, you can learn from their experiences. There are many books, online resources and articles written by high level business people who can inspire and motivate your, as well as revealing the pitfalls and success strategies that they have experienced.  , The stories of successful companies are well worth reading. They are not always about one dominant personality but are often a combination of leadership and great team skills. How this achieved is an important lesson to avail yourself of as you aim to build up good staff in your company. The company that's always cited as an incredible success story is that of Southwest Airlines but there are many other good ones out there too – look at Fortune's top companies for ideas of which to research.  , Such places can provide an enormous range of great information to help you learn about starting a business and they often have free advisers available to talk you through government laws, business ideas, the dos and don'ts, etc.  , Your accountant and your lawyer will prove good mentors if you ask them for help. They also tend to know other people to refer you to for more detailed advice in specific areas.  , More general business mentoring can be found in the form of joining organizations relevant to your particular business. You will benefit from networking, from seminars, from dinner events, guest speakers, etc. and might even be able to tap into an advice line if one is offered. Think outside the square too – business can be extra challenging for women, so this can be a huge source of help, so if you are a businesswoman, consider joining a women's professional network of support.

Good choices for the main course include small sandwiches, fresh salad, avocado, or a baguette with specialty meats. Mediterranean foods are also great for romantic picnics.   Avoid messy things like pizza or chicken wings. Think of foods that are simple to eat and won’t leave a residue on your hands, or stains on your shirt.Ask your date if they are a vegan or vegetarian and make sure to see if they have any food allergies.; , Bring things you can snack on while you talk to your date. Think of snacks that don’t require the use of any utensils like nuts, chocolate, a cheese plate, or olives. Instead of cheap snacks like potato chips, use apple chips as an alternative.Fruit like strawberries, blueberries, or cut up melon is a great snack. Hummus and pita bread are a romantic snack both of you can share. Just avoid the garlic variation. If you’re going to bring candy try to keep it mature. Things like sugar coated nuts or high quality chocolate are better than the cheap stuff you’d find at a gas station.  , You can pack champagne, non alcoholic champagne, or even seltzer water in flutes for a picnic. If you’re younger or need to drive, you should pick the non-alcoholic alternatives.   Champagne has long been known as one of the most romantic alcoholic beverages in our culture.If you’re on a tight budget, you can get sparkling wine as an alternative. Remember to bring a corkscrew so you can open the bottle! You can keep your drinks chilled with a cooler filled with ice.  , If you don't bake you can pick up fresh cookies or specialty sweets like cannolis or chocolate croissants at a local bakery. However, if you’re on a limited budget or like to bake, making desserts at home is a cheaper alternative.   Chocolate has properties which promote good feelings and have positive health results.If you don’t feel confident with your baking skills, go with the instant bake items that are found in boxes.  , An old-fashioned picnic basket will add to the overall experience.You can find them at most home goods stores, or you can buy them online. If you really want to be authentic, you can visit antique shops for one.   If you can’t find a basket in time, try using a nice looking cloth or tote bag. Avoid packing your stuff in a backpack or box because it will take away from the romance.  , Plastic utensils come off tacky and cheap so avoid using them unless you’re on a budget. Even if you’ve brought finger food, remember you may need a knife to apply spreads or to cut cheese.   Bring a zip-lock bag so you can put dirty utensils in it after you’re done. Your silverware does not have to be expensive, just make sure it’s visually appealing.  , For an extra special touch, you can serve regular or nonalcoholic champagne in champagne flutes. While crystal flutes are the most formal, glass or even plastic ones are more appropriate for a special picnic.   If you do use breakable glasses, keep them wrapped in cloth or a towel during transportation. Stemmed or stemless wine glasses could be nice alternatives to champagne flutes.  , Your blanket should be big enough so you can both sit on it. Avoid white blankets since they can easily stain. Some blankets have a waterproof side which make them perfect for wet grass.   If it has recently rained you can bring a shower curtain lining to put under your blanket to prevent you from getting wet. Down comforters are filled with the undercoating of goose and duck, and are softer than synthetic blankets., Picnics usually leave a lot of waste, and you don’t want to destroy the beautiful environment that you just enjoyed. In addition, your date might not find it attractive that you litter if they’re an environmentalist.   Littering fines are different in different states, but can be anywhere from $1,000 in fines or community service.  , It’s not romantic to have a conversation when there’s something on your mouth. Because a lot of the food you brought is eaten with your hands, it could get messy.   For a more classy experience, cloth napkins are a good alternative to your typical disposable ones. Paper towels also work.  , It’s easy to be romantic if your date is in a location that they already like. Do they like the woods and being around nature or would they rather be on the beach? Do they like the warm weather and being in the sun or are they the type of person who prefers shade? Take all of these things into consideration before picking your location.   The wrong location will destroy the mood. Make sure that you tell your date before hand so they can dress appropriately for the location.  , Try to find a bigger park that has wide open spaces. You probably want to set the picnic up in a field, so avoid overly wooded areas. Think of places where the weather would be comfortable.   National parks often have fees associated with entering ranging from $40 to $60.Make sure to check the park's rules to make sure you can bring everything you want on your picnic.  , If your date doesn’t like the woods, you can opt to go somewhere else. If they like the sand and ocean, then the beach is a great place to have a picnic. If the beach isn’t their thing, then finding a garden, or just a wide open space outside is a good location for your romantic picnic.   A secluded area is the best for a romantic picnic.Make sure to cover your food when on the beach or else sand will get in your food. Some places restrict the consumption of alcohol.  , Rain can ruin a picnic, so make sure you check the weather forecast before making any final plans. If there’s a big chance of rain, don’t risk it. Pick a different day that’s convenient for both of you. The weather will also determine what kind of foods compliment the picnic.If there’s a slight chance of rain, make sure to bring umbrellas. Rain isn’t the only thing that can ruin the romance. Extreme heat or humidity can also ruin the romance.  , It may increase the romance if you plan your picnic around sunset, but make sure that you have enough time with your date before it gets really dark. Factor in how long it’ll take you eat and how much conversation you will have. Time flies when you’re having fun, so make sure to keep an eye on it.You’ll also need to make sure that the picnic coordinates with the other person’s schedule. Leave enough time for any unexpected delays.

Please note: These are up-to-date baking instructions according to the Totino’s website, but follow whatever baking instructions appear on the box if they are different from those here.; , Then cut the plastic wrap and peel it completely off of the pizza.   Don’t forget to remove the plastic in your haste to enjoy a hot pizza. It will melt all over the pizza and make it inedible, and might make a big mess in your oven. Do not allow your pizza to thaw before baking. Get it out of the freezer only as your oven is preheating.  , When your oven (or toaster oven) has finished preheating, place the pizza directly on the middle oven rack. This will produce the crispiest crust.Alternatively, you can also place the pizza on a cookie sheet, which can either be room temperature or preheated (by placing it in the oven ahead of time). This will not produce the same degree of crust crispiness, though. Be careful. Remember, the oven and the rack will be extremely hot. If you are a child or are inexperienced with using the oven, have an adult or more knowledgeable baker assist you.  , Cooking times vary slightly depending upon the Party Pizza variety you choose and the type of oven you use. Follow the package instructions. For instance:A cheese pizza should bake for approximately 11-12 minutes on the oven rack, 13-14 minutes on a cookie sheet, and 17-18 minutes in a toaster oven. A pepperoni pizza should bake for roughly the same amount of time as a cheese pizza. A supreme pizza should bake for about 14-16 minutes on the oven rack, and 17-19 minutes either on a cookie sheet or in a toaster oven. Remember, however, to trust your eyes and remove the pizza when it looks done. These thin, small pizzas will overcook and burn quickly!  , This is the easiest way to take the pizza out because a spatula can get right under the pizza to scrape it and bring it forward.   If the pizza is on a baking sheet, remove the sheet from the oven first. Hold the spatula in one hand and a plate big enough to hold the pizza in the other. Quickly transfer the hot pizza to the plate, either by sliding or lifting and placing it with the spatula. Remember — the pizza is hot, and so is the pan (if you used one). Be careful.  , If you are making it for yourself, you don't necessarily have to cut the pizza. You can just eat it whole.   If you’re sharing the pizza or want to be a bit more refined in your eating, use a pizza cutter to divide the pizza into pieces. (Totino’s Party Pizzas are now square instead of round, so you’ll get smaller squares instead of slices.)  , If you are in even more of a hurry or just really want to ensure maximum crispiness, you can try a variation that utilizes your microwave and your oven set on the broiler setting.Preheat your oven (or separate broiler) on the maximum broiler setting. Place a sturdy cookie sheet in the broiler to preheat as well, putting it on a rack that is as close to the heating element as possible. Put your frozen, unwrapped Totino’s Party Pizza on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave it on “high” until the pizza is completely thawed. The pizza will be soft and pliable and the cheese will have begun to melt. Carefully remove the hot cookie sheet from the broiler. Carefully slide the pizza from the plate to the hot cookie sheet. Carefully place the hot cookie sheet back into the broiler. Carefully wait for the pizza to finish baking. Remove your pizza from the broiler when it is crispy, bubbly, and browned.  , You can’t control what ingredients are inside the Party Pizza, but you can control the toppings. Start with a plain cheese pizza and add whatever veggies, cheeses, cooked meats, or other items that you wish.You can add chopped fresh or sauteed onions, bell peppers, olives, mushrooms, or other veggies; any cooked meats, from pepperoni to last night’s leftover chicken; extra mozzarella or other good melting cheeses; and any other toppings that will safely cook to the proper temperature in the time it takes to bake the pizza. Don’t overload the pizza, though. Totino’s pizzas have a very thin crust and won’t easily stand up to a mountain of toppings.  , You can also personalize your Totino’s Party Pizza as it completes its journey to crispy deliciousness. For instance, you can brush garlic butter, garlic oil, or olive oil along with pepper and parmesan onto the outer rim of the pizza during the last two minutes or so of baking.Or, you can add chopped fresh tomatoes, parmesan or feta cheese, fresh herbs like basil and oregano, or dried chile flakes to the finished pizza. If you want to make a Totino’s Party Pizza as healthy as possible, try adding tender mixed greens tossed with oil and vinegar on top.

You'll feel snugly and warm and look cute.Belt your sweater to give it shape and style. You can either do a skinny belt with the folds of the sweater hanging over it, or a big belt. Keep the belt around your waist to give you shape. Wear your over-sized sweater with leggings and boots. Leggings and boots make sure great fall and winter choices. Try to avoid wearing patterned leggings with a patterned sweater, because that will be too much patterning!; , In the grey gloom that can come with autumn and winter, a pair of fun, bright leggings or tights can enliven a sweater outfit. You can pair them with a sweater-dress or a long sweater.Patterned leggings or tights are great to pair with a plain, monochromatic sweater. For example: you might wear a pair of Monet inspired leggings (with overtones of purple, green, and yellow) with a black or grey sweater (you might even go for a long, green sweater if you're feeling a bit daring!). Solid, bright colored leggings or tights are fantastic ideas for autumn and winter. As an example you might pair solid, lime-green tights with a more subdued, patterned sweater (bonus points if there are hints of lime-green in the patterning of the sweater).  , Jeans are so incredibly versatile and they look fantastic with sweaters. It's the perfect no-fuss autumn or winter look. Different types of sweaters, and different types of jeans will give you a different look.A pair of ragged, holey jeans with rolled up cuffs looks great with an over-sized or big chunky cable-knit sweater. A perfect look for that lazy, rainy Sunday afternoon. Pair your nice jeans with a lovely, jewel-toned v-neck or a cardigan over your shirt to give you a nicer, more put-together look. Good for an afternoon stroll through the changing autumn leaves. Different sweaters will create a different look, depending on the jeans. You can wear a nice cardigan over a shirt, or a casual v-neck with your ragged jeans. The possibilities are basically limitless.  , There's nothing classier than pairing a collared shirt with your lovely jewel-toned v-neck sweater. Make sure that the collar is fully outside of the collar of your sweater.   You can tone down the business look with a pair of jeans, or dial it up with a pair of nice, dark slacks.  , You can pair any of your sweaters with a leather jacket and it will look good (a leather jacket is a fantastic accessory!), but a turtleneck sweater looks especially good.Pick a sweater in a darker color and add a long necklace to enhance the look.  , There are lots of things you can add to enhance a sweater outfit. Jewelry is always a great addition: a chunky necklace with your v-neck sweater enhances the line of the outfit while something like a pair of dangling earrings paired with a cable-knit sweater gives you a little sparkle.   Scarves are also great accessories, as well as being good for keeping you warm and cozy in the colder seasons. Boots are also great pair with sweaters: over-sized sweaters, a nice sweater and jeans, a sweater dress. They give a little bit of class to an outfit and keep your legs warm!  , When you're choosing the best sweater looks for spring and summer you don't want to pick a fabric that's going to be really hot, like cashmere. You need fabric that is light and breathable.As for the fabric go for a nice silk-blend, cotton, or nylon-poly blend. These will breathe more easily, they'll give you a little weight and warmth (especially in air-conditioned offices) without being overwhelmingly hot. A loose crocheted sweater can be a great idea for a summer or spring look. Wear it over a pale maxi-dress or t-shirt and rolled up jeans.  , Bright colored sweaters, or heavy black sweaters are good for autumn, but they aren't what you want to wear for spring and summer. Pick light colors and prints that have light colors (pastel like pale pink or blue are typical).   Grey is a great color to pair with fun summery prints. This way the focus is on your fun printed skirt, with the grey enhancing it, rather than drawing attention away from it. Pale, pastel colors are good because they won’t be as hot as black or dark purple.  , Part of cultivating the summer or spring look is to pair your sweater with something more summery. This could be something like a knit sweater with a bright, sporty mini-skirt.   Another good idea is pairing a white button-down sweater with loose trousers (cotton) and white sandals. You could also pair a light v-neck sweater with floaty, knee-length skirt. You want to balance the floaty, looser bottom with a more fitted sweater.  , Part of the fun of sweaters is having multiple layers. This is necessary in many places in the northern hemisphere where each day can have a succession of different temperatures and weather.   Layer your summer sweater over your tank top so that you're ready from when the sun comes out from behind that cloud. When wearing a cardigan you want to keep it unbuttoned, or mostly unbuttoned. This shows the layering better and makes it flow more nicely on each side.  , Even though you might think it's a good idea to wear that holiday sweater ironically, or because grandma will be hurt if you don't, holiday sweaters just don't look good on anyone.Really the only reason you should be wearing a holiday sweater is if you're attending a holiday sweater party or an ugly sweater party.  , This one can be hard to follow because it's pretty hard to tell which sweaters are going to pill. There are, however, a few things you can look for to make it less likely that you pick a sweater that's going to pill after a couple wearings.Check the material of a particular sweater. Merino wool, for example, tends to be stronger and less likely to pill that a fussy, fine-gauge cashmere. You should also pay attention to the length of the fiber used in the sweater, especially when it comes to natural, raw materials like cashmere. Longer fibers can be wound into tighter yarn, which makes it less like that the ends will come loose (which causes pilling). A good thing to do is let a sweater ""rest"" for 24 hours before wearing it again, because this lets the fibers rest from the stretching that happens when it's being worn.  , Stick to the sweaters that look good on you, ones that you feel confident wearing. Not everyone looks good in turtleneck sweaters, or a cropped top, or an over-sized sweater.   Try to avoid just following the ""fashion trends"" in terms of sweaters. For example, shrugs are not in these days, so hopping on that bandwagon will mean you're now stuck with a bunch of sweaters that you're probably not going to wear. Be careful with color, as well. That lovely mustard color might look good on the mannequin, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily going to look good on you (not that many people can pull of any version of yellow).  , Tying your sweater around your neck (especially if it's a pastel, button down sweater) is going to make you look like you're off to the country or yacht club. Unless that's the look you're after it's best to stay away from it.

"['practice stress management and relaxation techniques', 'create an anxiety hierarchy', 'self administer the systematic desensitization technique', 'cope with anticipatory anxiety']",How to Get Rid of Anthropophobia2," Relaxation techniques are important to the reduction of any anxiety or fear. Learning how to help yourself relax and calm down, will help in various stages of dealing with your anthropophobia. Successful use of these techniques to reduce your fear takes careful planning and regular practice. Try the following relaxation techniques.   Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is a practice where you consciously tense certain muscle groups then release the tension, noticing how it feels for the muscles to relax.Try tensing and relaxing muscle groups going from top to bottom or bottom to top of your body. Meditation is a practice where you sit comfortably and quietly, turning your attention to your mind.Through mediation you attempt to increase your focus and clear your mind. You can try by focusing on just your breathing for a certain amount of time while trying to clear your mind of thoughts and anxieties. Autogenics is a practice where you learn to self-produce a feeling of warmth and heaviness throughout your body resulting in feelings of relaxation. Autogenics requires a meditative like practice of synchronized breathing and repeating phrases to yourself over the course of approximately 3 months., Facing your anthropophobia and working through it (on your own or with a professional) involves being very specific about your fear and anxiety.Just as journaling about your experience will help with treatment, so will an anxiety hierarchy. Begin to identify a list of specific situations and the anxiety or fear you experience with each situation.Your list or hierarchy should include the following.   Create 10 to 15 situations where you might experience fear or anxiety, such as spending time one on one with someone, being at a family gathering, being at an airport. Most people discard some situations or pair some together, but you should end up with at least 10 situations. Rank each based on how much anxiety you experience where 1 is the lowest anxiety and 10 is the highest anxiety imaginable. The levels should look like the following; Low Anxiety (1,2), Low-Moderate Anxiety (3, 4), Moderate Anxiety (5, 6), Moderate-High Anxiety (7, 8) High Anxiety (9, 10). Make sure, when you are finished, that there are at least two situations in each anxiety level category.  , While doing this alone is not recommended, you may find it difficult to access the professional help you need. If you cannot get the help of a doctor, psychologist, or counselor, you can try practicing desensitization on your own. Make sure you do not practice this technique for more than 30 minutes at a time, or for more than two items on your hierarchy at a time. Repeat each of the following for every item on your anxiety hierarchy.Begin by using a relaxation technique for a few minutes.   Pick the lowest item in your hierarchy and imagine yourself in that situation for a tolerable amount of time. Stop imagining the situation and rate your anxiety level. Use a relaxation technique for at least 30 seconds. Imagine the same situation again for a tolerable level of time. Stop again and rate your anxiety level, and practice relaxation. Continue this pattern until you are experiencing low or no anxiety. Move on to the next item on your hierarchy and repeat the process. End each session with several minutes of relaxation.  , With anthropophobia, you may experience fear or anxiety leading up to spending time with others.This is commonly referred to as anticipatory anxiety. Symptoms of anticipatory anxiety can include trouble sleeping, stomach problems, or headaches. It can also include urges to cancel your plans or the desire to not show up.   Take deep breaths. Place one hand on your stomach and one hand on your chest. Breath in deeply by trying to push out the hand on your stomach. Breathing deeply from your stomach starts your body's calming response. Do whatever relaxes you, such as listening to music or taking a long bath or shower. Be kind to yourself. It may be easy to get down on yourself for canceling plans or being unable to do something due to your fear. Working through it takes time. Try repeating comforting phrases to yourself such as “I'm working on this. It will get better.” or “This is only temporary. I will beat this.”  ","['systematic desensitization technique', 'anxiety hierarchy', 'anticipatory anxiety', 'relaxation techniques', 'practice stress management']"
"['raise your respect level', 'save up money', 'complete the training side missions', 'find special items', 'collect useful vehicles', 'think laterally']",How to Be Good at Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas2," Respect is another stat that can be raised in GTA San Andreas, but unlike most of the stats listed above, it's next to impossible to raise it significantly from the beginning of the game. The higher your respect level, the more members of CJ's Grove Street Families gang you can recruit to help you with missions. Having a posse alongside you can make many missions significantly easier than they would be otherwise, so it pays to build a lot of respect.   Respect is gained in the normal course of the game by completing certain missions. You can also increase respect passively by making sure CJ wears green, the color of his gang, whenever he's inside Grove Street Families territory. Conquering another gang's territory and annexing it (by starting and winning a gang war, which essentially involves shooting a whole bunch of gang members) will raise CJ's respect by a whole bunch (about 30%). Tagging over another gang's graffiti grants a small increase. Killing drug dealers, police officers, and members of rival gangs grants slight increases to respect. Killing your own gang members, or letting them die, reduces respect.  , Fairly early on in the game, it's possible to start making a decent amount of money if you put your mind to it. Missions provide a good amount, of course; citizens can also be killed for their cash. Eventually, CJ can purchase businesses to provide him with regular income, but until that point, saving your money whenever you can afford to will grant you significant advantages later.   Drug dealers not only grant you respect when killed; they're also a great source of money. They tend to be short-tempered and well-armed, but if you snag a heavy vehicle like a semi truck and flatten them, they won't have much of a chance to fight back. You can also use sniper bullets to waste them from a distance. Getting busted or wasted will cost you money. If you save regularly, you can just reload the game instead and avoid the fees, although they aren't really that high. Another hidden cost of getting wasted or busted is the loss of all your weapons. If you've managed to collect a nice little arsenal, consider reloading to save yourself the cost and trouble of finding or buying your guns again. If you really want to game the system, save the game, then bet everything you have at an Inside Track betting shop. If you lose, reload and try again until you win. Each time you win, you'll multiply your money by a significant factor, and soon end up with more than you even knew you wanted.  This type of trick is commonly known as “save scumming.” It's effective, but many people consider it to be not in the spirit of the game, since it provides near-instant gratification with no immersion in the game world required. Set aside an extra save before you take advantage of it, just in case you find that the rest of the game's money missions become dull and lackluster afterward.    , There are a few basic types of side mission you can activate by appropriating specific vehicles. Paramedic missions activate from an ambulance, vigilante missions activate from a police or military vehicle, and taxi missions activate from a taxicab. There are a set number of missions available for each type of vehicle; complete them all and you'll be granted some very useful ability bonuses.   Completing the level 12 Firefighter missions makes CJ fireproof. Completing the level 12 Paramedic missions gives CJ the maximum possible health. Completing the level 12 Vigilante missions increases CJ's maximum body armor rating to 150%. Completing the level 12 Taxi missions allows all taxis to make unlimited jumps and nitrous boosts.  , Like most GTA games, San Andreas is chock-full of hidden items, scattered all across the state. If you manage to find all of a certain type of item, you'll be rewarded with multiple weapon spawn points, as well as money in some cases.   Tags are graffiti tag spots that CJ can mark with the Grove Street Families tag. Tag all 100 tag spots to unlock several weapon spawns at his house on Grove Street. Horseshoes are just what they sound like. Collect all 50 of them to give CJ a much higher chance of winning when gambling, and spawn some powerful weapons at the Four Dragons Casino. Snapshots are photo opportunities scattered around the city of San Fierro and nowhere else. Snap all 50 of them to earn a bit over $100,000 and some new weapon drops at the Doherty Garage.  , As long as you have garage space (more space can be acquired by purchasing additional properties), you can store vehicles for later use. At times, especially useful and/or hard-to-find vehicles will be available to snag and store. Having these special vehicles can make difficult later missions significantly easier.   Look for armored vehicles. The most obvious of these is the Rhino armored tank, which can be carjacked from Area 69 and stored in a garage for later use. Getting the Rhino home isn't exactly easy, but if you can manage it, once it's in your garage you can keep it. “Mission jack” super vehicles. There are many amazingly durable vehicles you can only use during missions. By failing these missions (usually by killing the mission boss or destroying the wrong vehicle), you'll be left with a locked version of the super car. You can push or drag the dead car into a garage to restore its functionality. Grab a Monster. The appropriately named monster truck of GTA San Andreas has ludicrously high clearance, and can simply drive over the top of most other cars, making it useful in some races and chase missions. Its excellent suspension and high clearance also make it ideal for off-road endeavors. You can sometimes find one at a spawn point in the trailer park near the Flint Intersection in Flint County. Save a tow truck. Having a tow truck on hand will allow you to mission jack many special vehicles by dragging the car back to a garage after you fail the mission. It's also useful for returning destroyed vehicles you'd previously stored back to their garage spaces, restoring them once again.  , There are many missions you have to approach one way only, but there are many you can be creative with, as well. Don't hesitate to take a helicopter to a shootout mission and land on a nearby roof to snipe enemies, or defeat a barricade by accelerating a heavy car to ramming speed and then jumping out of it as it hurtles forward, snagging a smaller and faster car to follow through once the blockade has been destroyed.   If you can't make things work one way, keep retrying the mission from different angles, and with different weapons and vehicles. Never give up, and you'll eventually find a way to pass the mission.

The existence of a well written contract is pretty good proof you have a contractor relationship with them. You are more likely to have a client-like relationship with an independent contractor. They provide a service and you pay them for that service, but they also are free to provide that service to other individuals or organizations at a price they negotiate. Think about this relationship in terms of the charitable interests of your organization. An independent contractor who writes grant proposals for you technically could write a grant proposal for another organization whose interests directly conflicted with yours. If the staff member was an employee, however, this wouldn't be appropriate. Expecting a staff member to be loyal to your charitable cause typically indicates that you have an employee-employer working relationship with them. Similarly, on the other hand, they typically would be considered an employee.; , While you may think classifying employees as contractors will save your organization some money, this classification isn't entirely up to you. The IRS looks at several factors to determine whether you should be paying payroll taxes for your employees. One of the factors the IRS looks at to determine whether someone is an employee or a contractor is how much control the organization has over what that person does and how they do their job.This factor generally concerns the extent to which you control the employee's time and behavior. For example, if an employee is working on the clock in your organization's offices, they typically couldn't be considered an independent contractor because you have extensive control over their actions while they're on the job. In contrast, if you have a staff member who works from home on their own time and is free to work whatever hours they want as long as they complete a certain amount of work each week, you are exhibiting a lot less control over their behavior. Typically someone who is paid by the hour and works in the organization's offices will be considered an employee. This is particularly true if they have scheduled hours and breaks and are expected to remain at their desk or other designated area while they are on the clock. Keep in mind also that the amount of training your staff receives may affect whether the IRS will classify them as employees or contractors. Contractors typically are expected to bring their own skills and work ethic to bear on an assignment, while employees are told exactly how to complete a task.  , Staff members are more likely to be classified as employees rather than contractors if the organization reimburses expenses and provides the tools or supplies needed to carry out their work.If a staff member is responsible for providing their own equipment and supplies, you're typically safe considering them a contractor rather than an employee, assuming the other factors line up with that classification. Similar analysis applies to whether staff members are reimbursed for any travel expenses. Since contractors customarily deduct business expenses, you typically would require them to cover these things. However, this depends upon the contract language; many contractors require reimbursement of third-party expenses. Staff members who have the freedom to hire their own assistants or delegate part of their work to others also may be considered contractors. On the other hand, if staff members are required to complete their work on their own, this typically weighs in favor of them being classified as employees. Typically contractors are paid by the job. A staff member still may be considered a contractor even though they're paid by the hour, if they're paid by submitting you an invoice for their time rather than clocking in to a time clock on the premises. Staff members' paid salary will almost always be classified as employees. Keep in mind that if your organization incorrectly classifies  employees, the IRS may determine you owe significant money in back payroll taxes, and your 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status may be in jeopardy as a result.  , Employee compensation is considered reasonable under IRS regulations if it is a similar amount that normally is paid for comparable services by comparable organizations under comparable circumstances.Your state nonprofit council typically has information on average salaries and other compensation paid by nonprofits operating in your state. You usually can get a report that lists compensation for each year, along with details regarding the organization's size and budget. These statistics will help you find organizations that are comparable to yours. Generally, you want to look at the compensation offered by organizations who are conducting similar activities, and who have a similar staff size and annual operating budget as yours. In addition, it can be helpful to look at organizations located in the same, or similar, geographic areas. Clearly a national organization would not be comparable to a small nonprofit that only operated in a single rural county. Because costs of living and operating an organization differ, look for organizations that operate in areas demographically similar to yours. For example, if your organization is located in the inner city of a medium-sized metropolitan area, organizations located in sparsely populated farming communities or major cities wouldn't be comparable.  , A salary review should consider the market value of a person providing similar services with the same responsibilities and authorities. This is not limited to other non-profit companies only, but comparably sized corporations. However, having an independent firm or people not on your nonprofit's board of directors conduct a review of the salaries offered to employees at comparable nonprofit organizations ensures your compensation is kept at a reasonable level.You can work with your state's nonprofit council to find individuals who would fit the bill and recruit them to conduct the review. Ideally, you want to create a committee of several people who would be responsible for reporting to your board of directors each year. Set up a system whereby compensation is reviewed annually and voted on by the board.  , Once the review is completed, written documents and evidence of the review process and the organizations compared should be kept in case the IRS questions the amount of compensation paid.Start a file to keep with your other business records and maintain documentation for each year. Put the data collected regarding comparable organizations as well as reports produced by your comparability review committee and notes or minutes from the board meeting in which the report was presented and compensation put to a vote.  , Minimum wage laws are constantly changing, so be sure that you know the most recent wage limit for your state each year. These laws apply to both for-profit and nonprofit organizations. While many states introduce minor changes each year, or every few years, to account for inflation or cost of living, some states, like California and New York, are making drastic changes over the next few years. Make sure you plan ahead when paying your minimum-wage workers., Since most nonprofit organizations don't have extensive resources, benefits offered to employees should fit within your organization's budget as well as falling within the IRS's ""reasonable compensation"" guidelines.One way to reduce costs while staying within ""reasonable compensation"" guidelines is to offer retirement plans, but reduce or eliminate the amount of matching funds the organization adds to the employee's contributions. Using health savings accounts or fixed reimbursement amounts rather than health insurance is another way to offer benefits. There also are a number of group health insurance policies specifically designed for nonprofit organizations that offer health benefits at a lower cost to your employees without incurring much additional expense on the part of your organization. You also can provide benefits in other ways that don't result in taking money out of your budget. For example, many gyms offer membership discounts for people who work for a nonprofit, but you often have to register your nonprofit with the company first. Extending discounts to your staff members is an important way to offer benefits without breaking the bank. Other options perceived as benefits by your employees can actually save your organization money. For example, you may provide your employees the ability to work from home a certain number of days per month. Creating desk-share systems with staff members who work from home can reduce the overhead of maintaining an office. Consider giving your employees a four-day workweek. The extra day off will be seen by your employees as a benefit, while staggering shifts can ensure you have the people you need on site on any given day.  , The IRS considers bonuses and benefits that have monetary value as part of an employee's total compensation, and these also must meet the reasonability standards for nonprofits. Your independent compensation review committee that you formed to assess your compensation levels should also be used for assessing these bonuses and benefits.The independent committee should conduct a comparability review similar to that done for salaries to determine whether the bonuses and benefits you have in mind compare to those offered by similar organizations. As with salaries, make sure the reports and documents generated by the committee are kept in the organization's files with other tax and business documents in the event the amounts are questioned. Your entire bonus plan should be designed and implemented by the independent committee, with procedural safeguards to ensure employees can't take advantage of loopholes or otherwise abuse or manipulate the plan to get more money than they deserve and defeat the purpose of the plan.  , For a bonus plan to pass IRS muster as reasonable, you must be able to demonstrate that the plan furthers your organization's charitable purpose, and isn't simply a device to distribute profits.You typically don't want to have bonuses directly earned as a result of collecting a certain dollar amount in donations, as this looks too much like a sales commission. Rather, set objective standards for employee performance and base bonuses on those scores or other related criteria. For example, if your organization operates a soup kitchen, you could offer a bonus based on the number of people served in a given month. Bonuses should be related to the charitable purpose of your organization, rather than performance of tasks related to the operation of the organization itself.  , In early 2016, overtime pay was expanded to cover more salaried workers. That is, any salaried workers making less than $47,476 annually are now entitled to overtime pay for hours worked past the standard, 40-hour workweek. The previous salary limit was about half of this new one. This law, like other compensation regulations, applies to nonprofits as well. You may have to reassess your compensation if your salaried workers are making under this limit and working overtime each week.Note, however, that in 2017 a temporary injunction was filed to block the expansion of overtime pay. This means the law may return to a number around the previous threshold of $23,660. , Bonuses and benefits, or the equivalent monetary value thereof, are included by the IRS in an employee's total compensation when it conducts its analysis. Even if the salary falls below the ""reasonable compensation"" threshold, benefits and bonuses may push it over the top.To help easily evaluate the reasonableness of total compensation, any bonuses earned should be capped at a certain percentage of the employee's salary. That way you can evaluate potential total compensation using that maximum number. Keep in mind that whatever the maximum amount an employee could potentially earn in bonuses, you have to assume for the purposes of evaluating the reasonableness of their total compensation that they will in fact earn that maximum amount in any given year. If the maximum amount of bonuses, together with salaries and benefits, ends up being significantly greater than the compensation offered by comparable organizations, you run the risk of jeopardizing your organization's tax-exempt status.

"['be consistent in your processes', 'reward the dog promptly', 'be the boss while training', 'train your dog everywhere', 'be patient and set realistic expectations', 'keep practicing']",How to Teach Your Dog to Play Shy3," This means you should try to intone the cue words at the same volume and with the same tone of voice every time you administer the command. Dogs understand both emotional cues and the meanings of the words.When you teach the dog to be shy, you must utilize the word in the same way every time.   Consistency also means giving the dog a reward at the same time every time it obeys. When training, you should always provide a reward immediately after the dog has accomplished its trick. Let the dog hold the covering position for the same length of time. In the future, the dog will remember how long it is expected to hold the covered position based on the amount of time it did so before.  , When training your dog, you must reward it immediately when it behaves in conformity with your wishes. When it plays shy, exclaim “Good boy/girl!” in an enthusiastic, friendly tone, and give it a doggie treat.Creating the association between playing shy with receiving a reward will encourage the dog to act obediently.   Treats are a good reward, but need not be the only one. Dogs also respond positively to opportunities to play fetch, or go for a car ride or walk. Do not hold treats in your hand while training. The dog will learn that unless the treat bag is present, it need not comply with your commands.  , Dogs can read body language and posture. Let your dog know you are serious about his or her training by assuming a position of power.Stand up straight in front of your dog with your shoulders back when training. Keep your hands out of your pockets. Your dog may wrongly (or rightly) believe that you have treats in your pockets, and that will become “the” position he or she identifies with playing shy.  , If you limit training to only one space or room of the house, your dog will think playing shy is something to be done only in that one room.Train your dog to play shy in the bedroom, the living room, the basement, and the backyard.  , Some dogs learn faster than others. Think about how quickly your dog was able to learn to sit, play dead, and roll over. Average those learning times to assess how long it might take for him or her to learn to play shy. Continue to train your dog to play shy and it will learn in time. Do not become frustrated or angry at your dog if he or she is not learning at the pace you desire.Take notes at the end of each session and look for small signs of improvement over the long term. Always maintain a positive attitude and celebrate your dog’s progress. Relax and take a few deep breaths if you feel you are becoming frustrated or disappointed in your dog’s progress. If either you or your dog are growing weary of the training exercise, end it and try again later.  , Train your dog constantly. Training sessions should occur several times each day at random times. Do not train your dog for periods which are too long or too short.Each dog’s attention span varies. Pay attention to your dog’s level of interest; if he or she starts to wander away, lies down, or barks, it may be time to end the practice session and pick it up again later.

"['understand the purpose of action verbs', 'replace weak verbs with action verbs', 'note how action verbs can replace the passive voice', 'apply action verbs to your resume', 'use skill specific action verbs', 'adjust passive language with action verbs']",How to Use Action Verbs," An action verb describes something a person does, such as an achievement, in a clear and convincing way. Using action verbs in your resume, your essay, or in business writing will make your sentences more concise and easier to understand.When using action verbs, it’s important that you choose the right verb for the sentence or phrase. Choosing the wrong action verb can actually make your writing very confusing for your reader and leave them with only a vague idea of what you are trying to describe. Make sure you know exactly what the action verb means before you put it in a sentence or phrase. Some action verbs, like “illustrate”, “reveal”, and “illuminate” are all other ways to say “show”. But other action verbs, like “analyze”, “compare” and “evaluate” all have different meanings and should be used to fit the context of the phrase or sentence. A list of action verbs for resumes and professional writing can be found here.; , Often when we compose first drafts in writing, we resort to weak verbs or simple verbs. For example: “show”, “look” “think” “do”. While these are very clear verbs, they may come across as flat or underwhelming, especially when used in a resume to describe your credentials and achievements. Replace weak verbs with action verbs that add punch to your writing and to be as persuasive as possible. Potential employers will appreciate a resume that is concise and showcases your skills in a clear and strong way.For example, rather than state on your resume: “Showed clients how to use security software”, you can use an action verb: “Demonstrated how to use security software to clients.” Instead of stating: “Ran the dining room service”, rephrase this with action verbs: “Organized and supervised the dining room service.” Rather than note you “put together the team’s schedules and timelines”, use action verbs to make the sentence more specific by noting you “coordinated the team’s schedules and timelines” or you “created the team’s schedules and timelines.”  , The passive voice is when the subject in a sentence is not the doer or the actor (as in the active voice) but is being acted upon. Often, the passive voice uses “was” and “had” in front of a weak verb. The subject and object are also flipped in a passive sentence, for example: ""The road was crossed by the chicken"", rather than ""The chicken crossed the road."" Though there is nothing grammatically incorrect about the passive voice, using the active voice, with action verbs, can make your sentences stronger and more direct.For example, a sentence in the passive voice would be: “A poll on how many people use private healthcare in my neighborhood was conducted by me for my year end project.” If this sentence is adjusted to the active voice, with action verbs, it would be: “For my year end project, I created and prepared a poll of private healthcare use in my neighborhood.”  , Start by making a list of your skills and abilities in simple language, with simple verbs. Read over the list and replace the verbs with action verbs. You can also adjust the phrases so the language is concise and clear.For example, your list of skills and abilities for a customer service position at a retailer might be: “dealt with customers on a daily basis, ran the customer service desk, completed returns and sales transactions, worked with other customer service representatives, talked to my supervisor to keep the customer desk going, counted my till at the end of my shift.” If you rephrase this list using action verbs, it may look like: “responded to the needs of customers and provided excellent customer service, coordinated the customer service desk with the assistance of my supervisor, processed returns and sales transactions, communicated well with other customer service representatives, and balanced a cash float.”  , If you want to do revise your entire resume so it contains action verbs, you will need to use skill specific verbs to describe different skills. You will describe your communication skills differently than your creative skills and you will need to use different action verbs for each skill set.To describe your communication skills, use action verbs like “interpreted”, “coordinated”, “negotiated”, “clarified”, and “advocated”. To describe your creative skills, use action verbs like “composed”, “created”, “established”, “presented”, and “introduced”. To describe your service skills, use action verbs like “trained”, “assisted”, “facilitated”, “performed”, and “volunteered”. To describe your management and leadership skills, use action verbs like “achieved”, “managed”, “attained”, “implemented”, “motivated”, “organized”, and “supervised”. To describe your research skills, use action verbs like “identified”, “examined”, “analyzed”, “collected”, “measured”, and “surveyed”. To describe your technical skills, use action verbs like “designed”, “programmed”, “assembled”, “calculated”, and “engineered”.  , If you are trying to use action verbs in an essay or a piece of professional writing, you will need to shift any passive language and passive verbs to include active language and action verbs. Do this by going through your writing and identifying instances of the passive voice. Then, consider how you can shift the language to the active voice. Pay attention to the use of “was”, “had” and “has been” in your writing. These are often signs of the passive voice and need to be adjusted to the active voice.For example, a paragraph in the passive voice would be: “A poll on how many people use private healthcare in my neighborhood was conducted by me for my year end project. This meant I was interviewing my neighbors in their homes. A spreadsheet was used to keep track of the information collected. The due date for my project was met and I was awarded an A.” The same paragraph adjusted to the active voice would be: “For my year end project, I created and prepared a poll of private healthcare use in my neighborhood. I interviewed my neighbors in their homes and created a spreadsheet to record and analyze the data. I completed the project by the due date and achieved an A.” The second version in the active voice is clear and concise. It uses action verbs that are not too complicated or difficult, but still gets the point across to the reader.  ","['weak verbs', 'passive language', 'purpose', 'passive voice', 'action verbs']"
"['decide who you want to be', 'identify your personal values', 'check for contradictions', ""set goals that align with your vision.having goals that don't fit with your overall values is like riding in a buggy with two horse that are going in opposite directions - it's mayhem"", 'reassess your progress over time', 'learn constantly', 'find passions', 'think positively', 'boost your self-esteem', 'be open-minded', 'stand behind your choices', 'cultivate relationships with positive influencers']",How to Achieve Self Actualization," The only way you can reach self-actualization is to envision what your actualized self will look like. Connecting with your future self is an important step in reaching personal goals. Two ways you can connect with your future self are:Creating a vision board. Prepare a collage – either online or with photos and paper – that sums up the future self you hope to become. Browse through magazine or online galleries and search for pictures and phrases that represent the person you envision yourself becoming. Paste all these images and words together to create a larger image depicting your future self. Writing a letter. Another powerful way to forge a connection with your future self is with a “Dear Future Me” letter. Write in detail about all the things you are proud of or inspired by about your future self. Go on to tell exactly HOW and WHY your future self reached these successes.; , Once you have a general idea of where you want to end up you need to go back to the drawing board and figure out how to get there. Pinpointing your personal values can give insight on what drives your decisions, beliefs, and ideas. Think of your values as a road map directing you to your future self. Identify your values by doing the following:Think of two people you admire. What characteristics describe them? If you could change something about your local community or the world in general, what would it be? If your house was on fire, what three things would you take with you? When was the last time you felt really accomplished? Describe the moment and why you felt this way. Which topics do you stand up for or get really riled up about? Why do these topics get you going? Once you have considered these questions/statements, look for themes in your answers. Any recurring themes may shed light on your values.  , After you have performed an analysis of your values, compare these to your future self. Do your current values coincide with the life you hope to someday lead? Now, reflect on your everyday behaviors, beliefs, and principles. Do these match your values and the person you hope to be?   If you are not currently living out the values that are important to you or that will help you manifest into your future self, you will need to do some restructuring and goal-setting., You can have the most inspiring goals, but if they are not supporting your personal values, your success won't feel like success.For example, Joe finds that his biggest values are community involvement, integrity, and leadership. In his current job, he is a supervisor at a non-profit organization that offers scholarships and training to under-served student populations. He learns that all the funds are not being directed to students as he once thought. Despite him meeting his values of community involvement and leadership, Joe may feel dissatisfied with his job because the organization is not one of integrity. Joe must develop new goals that align with his values to bring him balance and happiness.  Create SMART goals - those that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely. Ensuring that your goals meet these requirements can help you accomplish you goals faster and move closer to self-actualization.  , Self-actualization is a careful balance of goal completion and values. Whenever one becomes misaligned, you will need to revisit both your values and goals. If your values shift, for example, because you have a family, you will need to create new goals that coincide with these new values.  , Committing to becoming a lifelong learner is the ultimate step in achieving self-actualization. A lifelong learner is one who uses information and experience to expand his own horizons and his life accordingly. Become a lifelong learner by:Questioning your assumptions - Think twice about unquestioned beliefs or biases, asking yourself ""What else could I assume?"" or ""What evidence do I have for or against this assumption?""Teaching learned skills to others - Whether it's information from your career or study gleaned from a hobby, teach it. Teaching what you know to others helps you gain exposure, allows you to be seen as an expert to others, and enhances your knowledge of the subject.Reading books Cultivating relationships with intellectuals Journaling Meditating Engaging in problem-solving Joining organizations Attending workshops Getting involved with projects  , Passions are activities that you are willing to invest time and effort into because they bring you great pleasure. Passions result in a decrease in negative emotions and increased psychological well-being.These can range from writing to running to collecting stamps. More than likely, these passions will also align with your values in life.   If you have trouble pinpointing any passions, think about the last event you attended. You had to buy a ticket, coordinate your schedule with a buddies or partners, and find something to wear. You put in a lot of effort to go to this event. Now, think about other events you have attended over the past year. Do you notice any recurring themes?, Being able to look on the bright side of things is key to personal success and well-being. People who thin positively tend to have less health problems, stronger immune systems,and greater resilience to difficult life problems.One way to become a more positive thinker is by eliminating negative self-talk.   Spend a few minutes each day paying careful attention to your self-talk. What are you saying to yourself as you go about your daily routine? Are these thoughts uplifting or belittling? If your self-talk contains a lot of criticisms, aim to replace these negative thoughts with more positive, helpful statements. For example, if you catch yourself thinking ""This is too hard. I don't know how to do it"" reframe these statements to ""This is a difficult task. I may need extra help in getting it done.""  , Self-actualized people feel a sense of worthiness and respect for both themselves, and others. Appreciating who you are and recognizing your worth are instrumental in developing a healthy mindset. Two practical solutions for boosting self-esteem are overcoming perfectionism and the tendency to compare.   When we hold ourselves to unrealistically high standards (perfectionism), we will always fall short. Having realistic expectations about what you can accomplish motivates you to work harder and makes your feel good about yourself. When you move past perfectionism, mistakes aren't permanent failures, and even tiny successes are worthy of celebration. Assuming that everyone else has a better time than you is a recipe for disaster. All humans have shortcomings and comparing yourself to someone else based on what you see from the outside is unfair to you. The only comparisons you should be making is with yourself today versus yesterday.  , A self-actualized person is capable of considering alternative opinions, perspectives, and methods that differ from his own. Being open-minded does not mean you are wishy-washy. Instead it means you can adequately assess multiple variables of a situation before coming to a conclusion. You welcome new experiences and are accessible to positive reactions. You can learn to be more open-minded by completing these two exercises:Think of a highly charged topic (e.g. abortion, war, artificial intelligence, etc.) and take the opposite side of the argument from your own. List five valid statements that support this position. Recall a time when you were betrayed or hurt by another. List three potential reasons this person may have hurt you, either by accident or on purpose.  , While self-actualized individuals may be open to various opinions and perspectives, they are also self-reliant. Being emotionally self-reliant translates to having the confidence to make your own decisions without relying on the influences of others and standing behind these decisions. If you are interested in becoming more emotionally self-reliant, try these three strategies:Quit waiting for an ""okay"". When you have a big decision to make, it can be easy to delay or put off making a choice because you are waiting for some other key player in your life to grant you permission. Self-reliance means trusting your intuition and making the choice that suits without relying on others to tell you its okay. Jump off the see-saw. Going back and forth on a decision after making it builds self-doubt. Once you have chosen, move on. Stop weighing the pros and cons and doubting the value of your decision. Stay the course. Even if a decision you made leads to subpar results, it doesn't mean you're on the wrong path. If you truly want something, you don't roll over and surrender after being faced with opposition. keep pushing towards the life you want.  , A sense of belonging and love are important needs in realizing self-actualization. However, ensuring that the relationships you build are positive gives you an extra lift. When we surround ourselves with positive people we have greater self-confidence, make healthier decisions, and cope with stress better.Conduct an inspection of your close relationships. Do the people you spend the most time with reflect your personal values? Do these people make you feel good about yourself? Do they motivate you to be your best self?

"['use the ""buy it now"" option', 'place a bid', 'check the status of your bid', 'make a payment', 'give your seller feedback']",How to Buy Things on eBay3," If an item gives you a ""Buy it Now"" option, you will be able to bypass the auction process and purchase the item immediately. The price of ""Buy it Now"" items an vary quite a lot - depending on the seller's strategy:   Sometimes the ""Buy it Now"" price will be very low -- this is when the seller is trying to get rid of the item in a hurry, so they sell it at a lower than average price. You can get some great deals using the ""Buy it Now"" option, but these items get snapped up quickly, so you will have to act fast to avail of them. A good way to deal with this is to set up email notifications, where eBay will notify you when a particular item becomes available for immediate purchase.On the other hand, the ""Buy it Now"" price can often be higher than the average bidding price. This is because sellers are counting on buyers who need particular items in a hurry and are not willing to wait the several days it takes to bid in an auction. So unless you are in a hurry, it's important that you do your research to find out the average selling price for a particular item, before buying it using ""Buy it Now"".  , If the ""Buy it Now"" option is unavailable, or you're hoping to get a better deal on an item, you can use eBay's innovative online bidding system. The bidding system is very simple, all you need to do enter the maximum amount that you would be willing to pay for an item. eBay will then compare this amount to the bids of other potential buyers and will increase your bid incrementally each time you are outbid. They will continually raise your bid until they reach your maximum amount.eBay will only raise the price of your bid high enough to outbid other potential buyers. Once they reach your maximum amount, and the auction is still running, you will either need to accept defeat or raise your maximum bid. Once you have placed a bid, there is no way to retract it. If you win the auction, you will be obligated to buy the item. If you refuse, you will face penalties from eBay and may even have your account suspended.  , Make a note of how much longer the auction will be running for and check back periodically to see how your bid is doing. Once the auction ends, you will receive an email notification from eBay informing you whether you won the item or not. If you did, the email will also provide instructions on what to do next.  , The next step is to complete your payment for the item. You can reach the payment page by clicking on the ""Pay Now"" link, which can be found on the ""Review Order"" page, on the confirmation email, on the listing page and on the ""Purchase History"" page on My eBay. The viable payment options are decided by the seller, and while most will accept payment by credit card or through Pay Pal, some sellers will request payment by check, money order or bank wire transfer.Never send cash to a seller in the mail. It could potentially get lost or stolen, or the seller might keep it and refuse to ship you your item. You should make your payment as promptly as possible after winning the auction, a seller is entitled to open an unpaid item case if you fail to pay for the item after as little as two days. When entering your shipment information, double check it to make sure all of the details are correct. If the information is incorrect and the item is shipped to the wrong address, you are the one at fault.  , Once you have you have received your item, you can can rate the seller based on whether you had a positive or negative experience. eBay encourages you to leave feedback as it creates trust between buyers and sellers and improves the overall customer experience. You can leave feedback by going to the ""Feedback Forum"" on the eBay site and clicking on the ""Leave Feedback"" link on the right hand side of the page.While feedback is encouraged, it is advisable to contact a seller directly about any negative experiences before you give them a poor rating. Most sellers will do their best to reach a solution which is agreeable to both of you - whether that's providing a refund, or some other form of compensation. Your bad experience may have been due to unforeseen circumstances or simple human error, so it is best to give sellers the benefit of the doubt before slating them on the forums. When giving feedback, you can rate your experience as positive, neutral or negative, as well as provide a more detailed seller review. Try to be as factual and informative as possible and avoid making any offensive or personal comments, as this may discourage other people from selling to you.

"['remind the recipient of the purpose of your email', 'use an appropriate tone for your audience', 'don’t include a closing statement if your email is part of a chain', 'pick a sign-off that matches the tone of your email', 'use a sign-off that fits your purpose', 'avoid anything too affectionate', 'skip the sign-off in brief or chain emails', 'include your basic identifying information', 'keep your signature brief', 'set up an automatic signature']",How to Close a Business Email," There are a lot of reasons to write an email in a business setting. Pinpointing the primary purpose of the email will help you determine the best way to wrap it up.For example, if you are making a request, end with something like, “Thank you for your time,” or “Thanks for your consideration.” If you are responding to a request for information or assistance, you could end with “I hope this helps!” or “Let me know if there’s any other way I could be of assistance.” If you’re setting up a face-to-face meeting, you might end with something like, “See you next week!”; , Think about how well you know the person you are writing to, what kind of relationship you have with them, and what you are trying to accomplish. An email to an upper-level manager or an important new client should probably be more formal than an email to a well-known co-worker.For example, if you are setting up a meeting with a client, a good closing statement might be something like, “I look forward to our meeting on the 24th. If you have any questions, please contact me at 555-555-5555.” On the other hand, if you are arranging a friendly meeting with a coworker you know well, it may be perfectly fine to end with something like, “Sounds good! See you tomorrow! :)”  , If this is your first email about the topic at hand, or if it’s a particularly important email, then it’s probably a good idea to include a closing thank you or “call to action.” However, brevity is important in business emails. If your email is part of a long chain, you may not need to include anything beyond the most essential information.For example, if you’re wrapping up a long conversation over email with your boss about an assignment, you may not need to say much more than, “Ok. I will have it done before the end of the day on Friday. –M.”  , If your email is formal, sign off with something like “Best regards,” or (for an even more formal touch) “Sincerely.” For less formal emails, you may be fine using something like “Take care” or “Cheers.”If you’ve had previous emails from the person you’re writing to, you might look at their sign-off and match your tone to theirs. For example, if they tend to sign with something like “Warm regards,” you should sign off with a similar level of formality.  , Like the closing sentence, a sign-off can also reflect the purpose of your email. For example, if you’re making a simple request or briefly expressing gratitude for something, you might use a sign-off like “Many thanks,” or “Thanks so much,” followed by your signature., Unless you know the person you’re writing to very well, avoid anything too slangy, informal, or affectionate. In general, things like “Love,” “XOXO,” or “Hugs” should not be used in business emails., If your email is part of a long chain, or if you’re trying to communicate something very briefly and quickly to a co-worker, it may not be necessary to include a sign-off at all.   If you don’t feel comfortable skipping the sign-off altogether, a simple sign-off like –Bernice or –B. should be just fine for brief, informal emails., How much information you include in your signature will depend on how well you know your correspondent, and how often you have communicated with them.   A first-time email should probably include at least your full name, job title, place of work, and phone number.When communicating with a co-worker or someone you email frequently, it is probably sufficient to sign with your first name or initial., In general, it’s best not to clutter up a business email with a lot of extra text and images. Avoid adding anything unnecessary to your email signature, like quotes, flashy graphics, or a lot of links., If you don’t feel like writing out your job title and contact information every time you send an important email, you may wish to create a signature that your email client can automatically add to your messages.   Some programs, like Outlook, allow you to create multiple signatures, so you can select the one that is most appropriate for any given email.

Don’t wear clothes which are too tight, especially around your joints. You will also want to wear clothing which is made of a material which breathes well, since you will sweat when doing many forms of exercise. Clothes specifically designed for exercise can easily be found.; , Just because we call them tennis shoes does not mean they are great athletic shoes. Shoes like Converse have little shock absorbency and can be terrible for your feet and bones. Get shoes which fit comfortably and are designed for the type of activity that you intend to do.  , Drink lots of water before you exercise. Your body will need the water to help your muscles work and also to help you sweat. If you’re dehydrated before you start, just think about how you’ll feel afterwards!  , Don’t stretch before exercising. Contrary to popular belief, studies have shown that this is not helpful and will not allow you to perform any better. If anything, stretching before exercising will make you worse off: it’s a great way to pull or strain a muscle and hurt yourself!  , Though researchers cannot agree definitively on whether or not warm ups help you to perform better in exercises, they all agree that warming up certainly won’t hurt.Warm up before exercising by doing a less intense version of your intended workout for 5-10 minutes. If you plan to run, jog first. If you intend to swim, swim slowly.  , Certain conditions may make it a good idea to check with your doctor before starting an exercise regimen. There are exercises for every health condition, but it’s a good idea to know what to avoid. Exercising should make you feel healthy and good in your own body: not hurt you!   If you have diseases or conditions like asthma or lung problems, arthritis, diabetes or liver and kidney problems, or heart disease, definitely talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.If you notice certain problems, you will also want to talk to a doctor. These include things like pain or dizziness following physical exertion, shortness of breath after very mild exertion or when at rest, or swelling in the ankles. You may also want to talk to a doctor simply to find out what kind of exercise they recommend for your particular goals and health conditions. You can also consult with a nutritionist and a trainer for more information on exercising and how you can best meet your goals.  , Aerobic exercise is often called a “cardio” workout, since it is designed to increase and improve blood flow. These types of exercises are of a lower intensity but last for longer periods of time.  , Climbing stairs is a great way to get your heart rate up. You can climb actual stairs or you can use a stair machine at a gym. Climbing stairs improves your leg muscles as well as your butt. Be careful if using actual stairs, however, as you do not want to fall and get seriously injured.   , This is not just a fun game for children but also an excellent workout. Working the arms, legs and core muscles, this is an exercise that you can easily do at home. It is also well known for improving balance and is excellent for people who intend to play sports.  , Jumping jacks are an exercise performed by standing with the legs together, arms at your side, and then jumping to move the legs outward and raising the arm together above your head. Jump again to return to the starting position. These are great for getting your heart rate up and burning calories.  , Walking and jogging are wonderful ways to get your heart rate up. Though jogging may be difficult on the knees for some people, walking is certainly an accessible exercise and should be done by those at every level. Studies have shown that walking an hour a day can help you maintain your weight over time and reduce your likelihood of certain conditions, like hypertension and obesity. , Swimming is great exercise and is fun to boot. This will work different muscles depending on the style of swimming you do. Swimming is frequently recommended for people with joint problems or those that are significantly overweight, as it can take a great deal of strain off of the skeleton while still raising the heart rate.  , Riding your bike is an accessible, environmentally friendly, and very effective way to get exercise. Working muscles in most areas of the body, bike riding will get your heart rate up while it gets you somewhere! You can bike outside or you can get a stationary bike and stay at home.  , Anaerobic exercises are those done at a higher intensity for shorter periods of time. These build strength and help your body to become accommodated to working hard. Paired with a healthy diet, these exercises can also help you to lose weight, as your body’s caloric use will increase. These types of exercise are actually arguably better for burning fat than aerobic exercises. , Running is tough on the knees and bone structure but is still an excellent form of exercise. You can run locally around your neighborhood or around a track at a gym. Remember that running is different than jogging: it’s much faster and much harder to do!  , There are many different types of weights you can lift and ways to lift them, but doing this type of exercise will help you build a variety of muscles and increase your strength. Be sure to start small and work your way up, since trying to lift something which is too heavy is a common way to injure yourself.  , Push ups are done by placing yourself with your stomach on the ground. Place your feet so that your toes are flat on the ground, then place your hands flat on the ground at face level, a shoulder’s width apart. Then, keeping the line of your back and legs completely straight, lift your body with your arms by pushing against the ground so that your whole body is supported on your toes and hands. Lower yourself back down so that your nose is nearly touching the ground and then raise yourself back up. Repeat.  , Squats are done by standing with your feet a shoulder’s width apart, back straight, arms crossed in front of you, and slowly lowering yourself down as if to sit in a chair. Once in the sitting position, slowly raise yourself back up. These are a great exercise for your core and leg muscles.  , Burpees (a common military exercise) are done starting in a standing position, then drop to a crouch, jump the legs back into push-up position, do one push-up (if you want), hop your legs back to the crouch position, and then jump straight upwards with hands raised to return to the standing position. This is a great workout as it exercises all areas of the body.  , Core workouts develop the muscles around your abdomen. This has many benefits. With a stronger core, you will be less prone to back pain and injury and you will also be able to improve bad posture. Paired with weight loss, strong core muscles will also give you defined abs.  , Planks are probably the most efficient core exercise. You can greatly improve your core strength with just a few minutes of this exercise every day. Planks are done by taking a position similar to a push up, but supporting the upper half of your body on your forearms and holding the position for as long as possible. It will surprise you how difficult it is if you’ve never tried it but the exercise is extremely effective.  , Crunches are another great core exercise, done by lying face up, knees bent, arms crossed at your chest, and lifting just the head and shoulder up towards the pelvis. Lower yourself back down and repeat.  , Sit ups are similar to crunches and are done by lying face up, knees bent only slightly, and rolling your upper body into a sitting position. You can cross your arms in front of you or run your palms up and down your thighs as you move to guide your movement.  , Bridges are a great core exercise because they also work on your bottom and lower back muscles. These are done by lying on your back, with your knees bent and your arms flat on the ground at your sides. Slowly roll your back and lift your hips until a straight line is created between your shoulders and knees, your back and thighs parallel, and then slowly lower it back into starting position.  , T’ai chi is a Chinese martial art, the forms of which are done in sequences of slow movements. Doing t’ai chi will allow you to build better balance but it can also be very relaxing. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.  , Weight shifts are a great starting balancing exercise. These are done by standing with both feet on the ground, hip width apart. Next, shift all of your weight onto one leg and lift the other slightly off of the floor. Hold the position, trying to maintain good form, for 30 seconds. Do the other leg. Repeat as much as you want. , These are done same as the above, with the exception that the lifted leg is bent backwards at the knee. This will work on your front-to-back balance, whereas the previous one focuses more on side-to-side. Both should be used in conjunction.  , Pilates is a series of forms and movements which occasionally makes use of tools like exercise balls, weights, and resistance bands. This form of exercise helps train muscles with the correct movement patterns which can improve balance, core strength, posture and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.  , Yoga is an Indian meditation technique and exercise which has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety (in turn aiding weight loss) and is excellent for building better balance and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.  , Various forms of dance, such as ballet, are actually fairly rigorous exercise and can significantly improve your flexibility, as well as your coordination. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center.  , Stretches should be done after warming up or exercising, as this will help prevent muscle strain and injury. Stretching your muscles will help provide much greater flexibility and can reduce the likelihood of injury due to strain during other exercises later on.A basic stretch to try is a hamstring stretch. This is done by sitting, splaying your legs apart, and reaching forward to touch one foot at a time. You can bend the leg which is not being reached across. Another basic stretch is a butterfly groin stretch. This is done by sitting on the floor and pulling both ankles in towards your crotch, getting as close as you can. Try to press your knees to the floor as you do this. Try a simple shoulder stretch. This is done by pulling your elbow across the front of your body towards the opposite shoulder. Press against your arm as you do this. This wall stretch aids mobility in the chest, shoulders, abs, hip flexors, quads and calves. Face a wall standing about a foot away from it, then reach your hands up as high as you can flat against the wall, leaning forward into it with your chest and hips while keeping your feet in position flat on the floor.  , You don’t have to dedicate hours of your day to exercising. Anything helps, so find ways to fit exercise into the smaller “in between” moments of your day. You can do squats while you wait for food to cook or microwave or fit in a minute of planks when you first wake up. Look and you will find moments in your day to get a little more active.  , If you spend most of your day sitting in a desk chair, you will find you have a lot to gain from finding an alternative. Using a standing desk or a standing desk in combination with a treadmill will get you burning calories while you work (it doesn’t even have to be fast paced, though the harder it is the more you’ll get out of it). If that’s not for you, try an exercise ball instead of a desk chair. Some research has found that using these methods can help you lose over 40 lbs a year if you’re overweight. , When getting to your apartment or office, skip the elevator and take the stairs instead. This is great because you can add a floor at a time as it becomes easier for you to get up the stairs. Eventually you can also run up the stairs for some added exercise.  , Whenever you can, stop using your car if it is possible for you to get yourself where you’re going on foot or on a bike. Turn grocery shopping into a workout by walking to the store a few times a week to pick up a smaller number of items. Take a bus to work and get off a few stops early to walk. Ride your bike to work if you can. If you have to take your car, park really far away from your building. This is a great way to introduce physical activity into your day. , This can be broken up into three 10 minute sets.  , If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.  , This will obviously need to be broken up. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for a few seconds, and then return.  , If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.  , Sit in a chair, stand up and repeat. You can try doing these squats without the chair if you have the strength and balance to do so., This can be broken up into two half-hour sets.  , If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.  , This will obviously need to be broken up. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for 30 seconds, and then return.  , If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets., This can be broken up into three 5 minute sets.  , This can be broken up into two half-hour sets.  , If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.  , At this point you need to work in variations like the side plank and reverse plank as well. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for a minute, and then return., You will want to choose weights and positions based on the muscle groups you wish to focus on. Break up the hour into three 20 minute sets and try to work different muscle groups in each set., This can be broken up into three 10 minute sets.  , Interval training is any exercise done at a very high intensity for only a few brief minutes (2-3 at most) and alternated with either no activity or a slow paced activity. Interval training is widely regarded to be one of the most effective exercise regimens, since it is less time consuming but appears to produce identical effects., The most basic interval training routine would be to sprint for 2-3 blocks (or the equivalent of 400 meters) and then walk back to the starting point, beginning the process over again.   An alternative would be to combine this with an aerobic workout. Warm up by walking slowly for five minutes, quickly for ten minutes, sprint for three blocks, walk back two block, sprint for three blocks, walk back two blocks (and so on, lasting 15 minutes), and then walking back quickly to your origin point to cool down.  , You can apply interval training to almost any exercise activity. Try cycling, swimming, many core exercises, and so on. Try to alternate between exercise activities on different days to ensure that all of your muscle groups get attention.  , You will want to set your goal for exercising at least ½ an hour a day. Slowly, over time, you should draw this out to 1 hour. This time period, however, can be broken up into sections and spread over the course of the day, however, those sections should be no less than 10 minutes. When you begin, exercise at least 2 days a week. Over time you should increase your frequency up to 5 days a week., Walking is the best thing you can do for improving your health. As discussed above, a study found that a mixture of intense and relaxed walking in senior citizens decreased the likelihood of certain diseases by 20%. You can walk with your friends, family members, or by yourself. If you want to walk in the comfort of indoors, you can walk around the inside of your apartment building or you can walk the inner corridor of the local mall. You can also walk outside if you prefer.   Try to walk for at least half an hour a day and go at a pace that gets your heart rate up. If you do not push your body at least a little, you will not gain nearly as much from the exercise.  , As we age, we tend to lose a lot of our balance. This is normal. However, you will want to work on your balance to help ensure that you can move around without hurting yourself. Do balance exercises to protect yourself and prevent injury.A good, basic balance exercise is to try standing on one leg. Make sure to do both legs in turn and to also have a chair nearby to hold on to if necessary to prevent falling.  , Muscles lose their elasticity over time, which can make it difficult for you to move around or get up if you fall. Do flexibility exercises like stretches to maintain your muscles and keep you safe and independent. , Lift small, 2lb weights (more if you can). This will help you maintain the strength in your hands and arms, allowing you greater independence for longer.  , Cool down exercises, like warm up exercises, are a gentler exercise, meant to ease your body between working hard and being at rest. Cool down by walking for 5-10 minutes and (preferably) stretching. Stretching before exercising is likely to cause injury but stretching after exercise, when the muscles are warm and active, will help improve their tone and flexibility., When you exercise, your muscles use up and your body sweats out a number of essential nutrients. You need to replace these nutrients or you can hurt yourself or become sick. These nutrients, water, sodium, potassium, and sugar, can be consumed in a number of ways. You could try drinking water and eating a banana or drinking water and eating a protein bar, among a variety of other options. If you choose to drink a sports drink, it is best to dilute the drink at a ration of 6 to 1 (that is 6 parts water for each part drink) since these drink's sugar content is unnecessarily high.  , Exercising, especially the kind that pushes your body beyond its comfort level (the good kind!), can cause muscle pain and discomfort. This is normal and a healthy sign of your body getting into shape and becoming stronger. You may want to manage the pain though. This can be done by taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen or using an ice pack.Intense pain with a fast onset is an indication that you have injured yourself. Consult with a doctor or nurse, especially if it is very severe or lasts for more than a few days. Prevent muscle pain to begin with by slowly easing into exercise, both in an individual routine but also over the course of time. Don’t leap straight into a high intensity program but rather build yourself up to that level over the course of several months.

Don't wear clothes that are too tight, since these will just make your breasts look bigger and draw attention to them. You also don't want to wear clothes that are too big or loose, because these will make your breasts look bigger but will also make you look bigger over all. Instead, just wear clothes that fit you, neither too loose nor too tight. Not only will this be more comfortable, but it will reduce the visual appearance of your chest.; , Wear shirts that are long, with a hem line down around the widest part of your hips. This will draw the eye downward and away from the chest, while also emphasizing your hips. Together, this will do a lot to reduce the appearance of your hips.  , Wear shirts that flare out below the natural waist. This will help draw the eye downward and away from the chest. This style of shirt is very trendy and in fashion right now as well.  , Wearing a dark shirt in general, using colors like black, navy, and forest green, will reduce the appearance of your chest. This works by reducing the appearance of highlights and shadows, which makes it harder for the eye to perceive depth and shape.   If you want to make the effect even stronger, pair the dark top with a skirt or pants that are brightly colored. Wearing turquoise, pink, yellow, red, or other bright colors will draw the eye down from your chest to your hips and legs.  , In general, wearing clothes that emphasize your hips will draw attention away from your chest and make it look smaller by comparison. Wear horizontally striped pants or skirts and when you wear skirts, try to wear full, circle skirts. These will add volume to your lower half and make your body look more even.  , Turtlenecks and especially bulky turtle neck sweaters will only make your chest look bigger. Tight turtlenecks will only make your breasts look bigger and thicker turtlenecks will just add bulk, achieving the same effect.  , Natural waist tops, which draw the waistline upwards, and empire waist tops which create the cinch of the waist just below the breast line both serve to make the bust look bigger. Avoid both of these styles as they will only emphasize your chest by making it look bigger in comparison to your waist.  , Of course, you'll want to skip tops that emphasize your cleavage. Anything that is very low cut is only going to make your breasts look bigger. So much bigger, in fact, that they'll probably accurately look like they're on the verge of falling out! Instead, wear items that are slightly higher cut.   For some people, V-neck and sweetheart necklines will make the cleavage and bust look bigger and more noticeable. Some people, however, find that they prefer the appearance they get with this neck style. Experiment to see what works for you.  , You'll want to pass on clothes that add bulk around your breasts, making them look even bigger. Cowl-neck sweaters and tops, ruffle-front blouses, longer scarves, shirts with puckers or gathers around the breasts, and many other items will add a lot of fabric at the bust line, making your breasts appear even bigger.  , Horizontal stripes will make your chest appear wider and according make your breasts look bigger. Instead, wear narrow vertical stripes, as these will draw the eye upward and make your chest look smaller. This is because it tricks the eye into thinking the two sides of your body are closer together.  , When you have bad posture, you breasts will sag and hang, which just makes them look bigger. Standing up straight with your shoulders pulled back will lift the breast and cause the tissue to be more taught and stretched, physically reducing it's outward shape.   If you have trouble standing straight, there are many back braces and posture correctors available online or from your doctor.  , There are a number of bras which can help. Minimizers are designed for this purpose and simply work by adding no extra bulk.You can achieve the same effect by using an unlined bra, which is often cheaper. However, most women with large breasts find that they prefer the support of a more structured bra. Because of this, you may find that a maximum support, high quality sports bra works better for you. A sports bra will squish your breasts down and make them appear physically smaller.   It's also really important to wear a bra that fits. , Shapers are vests or shirts which are made out of tight elastic. A normal shirt is then worn over the top. You can find shapers for the chest from many department stores as well as from online stores.  , Chest binders are shapers on steroids: they'll significantly reduce your bust by maximizing how much they compact your breasts. Their effect may be to strong and constricting for some people, however, so only use this option if you're looking for serious reduction.  , A temporary solution for desperate situations is to do traditional chest binding. This is where you use a tighter material to bind down your breasts - preferably a chest binder, but a tighter sports bra will also suffice. This is useful if you just need to temporarily reduce your bust in order to fit into particular clothes for a special event.  Do not use ace bandages or duct tape for chest binding - these materials aren't made for binding, and using these can result in shortness of breath, damaged or collapsed lungs, bruised or cracked ribs, torn skin, back pain, spinal damage, dizziness, and permanent damage to the breast tissue. Do not be tempted to use an elastic bandage, as this becomes very uncomfortable and dangerously constrictive if it is pulled tight enough to have an effect.

If a trip to your local Party City is not a success, try amazon.com or a similar site. (Look under Men's Clothing and Accessories in the subcategory ""Suits and Sport Coats."" From there you can choose specific colors, such as green or purple) In most cases; his shirt, suit jacket, gloves, and trousers are purple and his waistcoat and sometimes his tie are green.; , The Joker's tie is brown (and sometimes an olive green), as are his shoes. Any brown tie and dress shoes will suffice for your representation, though if you're striving for perfection, consider looking through pictures from the movie or watching the movie with a watchful eye for wardrobe.  , This is a simple effect to produce. During the Halloween season, Walmart carries an assortment of aerosol hair-dyes that wash out in various colors, including green. They usually cost between $3.00 and $7.00 a can.  , The Joker carries a knife to torture his victims and supplies a different backstory each time he is witnessed holding the knife to someone's face. It is frowned upon to carry a knife around; however, there are multiple toy-weapons available at Party City and online. Mock weapons are also sold as children's toys in stores.  , The face paint, or ""war paint"" as it is called in ""The Dark Knight"", not only hides The Joker's true identity but enforces the image that Gotham's citizens have of him. Replications of his makeup are simple to create. First, appropriate the following: White face paint; black face paint, eyeshadow, or liquid eyeliner; and red face paint or lipstick. Coat your face from the top of your forehead to your chin in white face paint, also coating your ears. To follow Heath Ledger's Joker costume, smudge black face paint, liquid eyeliner, or eyeshadow heavily over your eyelids. There is no need for strict lines or boundaries; as long as your eyelids are coated and the edges look hazy, it'll work. For the lips, cover your lips in red lipstick and either run the red lipstick in a thick, vague line about an inch and a half past both corners of your mouth. The line should curve like the joker's demonic grin and blend a little bit into the white. To achieve the look, draw the lines on your cheeks and smudge them lightly with your fingers. Conversely, if you wish to look more like Jack Nicholson's Joker, lightly line your eyes with black liquid eyeliner. Don't get any in your waterline, keep the liner in a very thin line on the outside of your eyelid. Next, cover the area of your lips in red lipstick and very carefully extend the lines outward to recreate the shape of his very thin lips. Don't just draw thin lines, but extend the shape of your lips to make it seem like the corners are further apart and your lips are thinner. If you already have naturally very thin lips, this look is easier, and you only have to extend the corners of your mouth a slight bit with the red lipstick.  , You'll find that, when applying the white face paint, your teeth naturally look more yellow when compared to the bright white.

Don’t choose a short story that can be read in 30 minutes; likewise don’t read an 800 page book that will take 13-14 hours to complete if you don’t have the time nor patience. Timing is especially relevant when you have a deadline such as an assignment for school.   Also consider your history with reading. If you are used to reading only one 400 page book per month, try to choose a book that is a fraction of that size, like 150-200 pages. This allows your goal to be realistic while still challenging.; , If you have a choice, pick a book that will really pique your interest instead of choosing a boring book that will only make you want to stop reading. Try one from your favorite author, read a review online, choose based on recommendations from others, or choose based on your personal interest in subjects.Many people read a variety of subjects as a means to get better at being a human and being a life-long learner.Try keeping a reading list of books that you want to read. Whenever you come across a book that interests you, update your list so you always have something interesting from which to choose., There are many times people are unable to choose their reading material because it has been assigned to them for school, work, or other projects. Even if you find yourself hating the material, set a plan in motion to keep reading. Keep in mind that even if you don’t like something, you can always learn from it, which is usually the goal. Not only will it be preparing you for an immediate gain (like a good grade on a test), but it will also provide you with knowledge of a person or topic of which you were previously unaware.Even if you feel the text doesn’t keep your attention, you can always focus on what worked or didn’t work, what the author did well and what they didn’t. Not only will this show a deep analysis of the text, but it will also help you in determining what books you prefer to read. Commit to your goal. If you are forced to read an assigned book within a week’s time, prepare yourself by truly committing to the goal. Always remind yourself of what depends on your completion of the book (a grade, a report, a presentation, etc.).  , This is especially helpful if you have an assignment due date or if you consider yourself a weak-willed individual. Having a routine in place will help you to stick with reading and help you reach your goal. Learning your reading speed will help you determine how many hours it will take you to complete the book.Learn how fast you read. Determining how many words per minute (wpm) you are able to read will help you to determine what size book to choose as well as how much time per day should be spent reading.Time required can fluctuate based on the difficulty of the text, but having an idea of how long it will take will give you a measurable goal to work with. Choose the right time of day to read. You should always choose the time of day when you have the most energy so you’ll be more focused and more prepared to learn. Try treating it like an appointment and schedule time with yourself each day to read.Wake up, take a shower, and read while eating breakfast; or stop at your favorite coffee shop on the way to work and spend 30 minutes reading while enjoying your coffee. By putting everything in its “proper place,” you’ll be more likely to stick to your assigned task  , The more you read, the more you will enjoy reading. Try to sit alone and read for at least 10 minutes before taking a break. Before you know it, those 10 minutes will have passed and you’ll be hooked.The more you learn to read for pleasure, the easier it becomes. Keep in mind the number of pages or chapters you need to read daily to meet your goal.   After your goal of 10 minutes, aim for reading one to two chapters. By then, your interest will have been piqued and you’ll want to continue reading without checking the time., Aside from your scheduled time, use your free time to read a few extra pages or chapters. Instead of checking Facebook or playing games on your phone, use the extra 5-10 minutes to catch up on your reading.   Depending on how often you read, you can add an extra 30 minutes to 1 hour each day. This equates to an increase of about 5 hours per week.Carry your book anywhere you go so you will always be prepared to read. Use your phone or an electronic reading device such as a Kindle to always have a book at your fingertips.If you’re on a deadline, remove distracting apps from your phone for the week.Even if you’re only able to read ahead a few pages, you’ll still be ahead of your goal which can boost your confidence and give you a rewarding feeling., If you are falling behind in your reading and have a deadline to meet, feel free to skim over a few pages. Read the first few pages of the chapter and look for the main idea of the chapter and how it fits into the flow of the book.Look for any important plot points or new characters that will be helpful in later chapters.   Skim headings and subheading to search for organization and main ideas. Read the first and last sentence of each paragraph. If you are able to abstract the meaning, move on; otherwise, it may be necessary to read the entire paragraph., No matter what happens, don’t stop reading. If your deadline is approaching and you feel like you won’t reach your goal, continue pushing and read as much as you can. If you don’t have a deadline, continue your routine and determine how long it actually takes you to finish reading the book. This will help you in being able to realistically set future reading goals.  , Once you fall behind in your reading it is hard to catch up. Try not to “owe yourself one” or think that you’ll double up on time later.This can cause people to feel overwhelmed and helpless, and can cause people to give up instead of pushing forward.   Try sticking to a schedule and routine to avoid falling behind. If you do fall behind, make a realistic plan about how to get back on track. Give up television for one evening or take your book to the gym to make up time. Be sure to control your emotions if you find yourself behind in your goal. Keep from feeling overwhelmed and hopeless by putting a realistic plan into action.The best way to avoid this feeling is to stay ahead of your reading at all times.  , Get rid of any outside source that has the potential to steal your attention away from your book. Turn off your laptop, close yourself in your bedroom, turn off the television, and leave your phone on the charger.Make this time an important priority over everything else.  , If you read while tired, you’ll either fall asleep within a few pages or you won’t retain any important information. Instead of reading at the end of the day when you’re drained, try reading as early in the day as possible when your mind is still fresh and fully functioning.Being comfortable is a major part of reading; but being comfortable and tired is usually a recipe for disaster. Avoid reading in bed unless it has become habit or part of your winding down routine for bedtime.  , Attempting to read a book in a week without previous practice can be a difficult task. By reading and sharpening your learning skills, you are able to practice your ""meta-skills"" and become more proficient in learning, reading, remembering and thinking.If possible, try to increase your reading skills before setting your goal to read a book in a week.   This practice can be equated to cutting wood. If you have wood to cut you must first sharpen your saw when cutting the first log, not the last.You can build your skills by reading more (not just books), reading often, or trying a speed reading program.","['high-interest book', 'free time', 'practice', 'book', 'limit distractions']"

Pay attention to how your shoulder feels at rest and when you move it.   Joint separations are graded from mild (grade one) to severe (grade three). Grade one is a sprain, grade two is a partial separation, and grade three is a full separation. A grade one AC separation might just feel sore, while a grade three separation might cause intense pain.Grades one through three are the most common classifications, but there are actually three more grades: four, five, and six. These are rare and usually involve tearing of the deltoid and/or trapezius muscles.Along with pain, you might also notice some swelling in your shoulder if you have a grade two or grade three AC separation.; , As you move your shoulder joint around, it should be silent. If you hear any popping sounds, it may mean that you have injured your AC joint. Gently rotate your shoulder around and listen for any popping or snapping sounds.   Keep in mind that hearing a popping sound is more common with a grade three separation.See your doctor as soon as possible if you hear popping sounds.  , Examine your shoulder and the area around it to determine if you have any bumps. A small bump can form on the top of your shoulder where your clavicle bone stops. This is almost always a symptom of a shoulder separation.Having a bump on your shoulder is more common with a grade three separation.See your doctor right away if you notice a bump.  , Movement of your clavicle bone is a symptom of a separated AC joint.Your clavicle is the bone that connects your breastbone to your shoulder. Place your hand on your clavicle and gently push it to see if it moves or remains stationary. Your clavicle should not move when you press it.   Movement in your clavicle is also more common with a grade three AC separation and indicates that you need to see a doctor as soon as possible.  , Try to rotate your injured shoulder in all different directions. Not being able to move your injured shoulder in the same ways as you can move your other shoulder may be a sign of a separated AC joint. Try moving your shoulder in the following ways:   Lift your shoulder up. Push your shoulder down. Pull your shoulder across your body. Pull your shoulder out to the side. Pull your shoulder back and stretch it behind your head.  , Cold or numbing sensations in your extremities or fingers can also be a sign that you have suffered a shoulder injury. Apply some gentle pressure to your shoulder and the surrounding area to see if you can feel it.Sit or stand still and begin to press gently into your affected shoulder. Try this with your unaffected shoulder as well to see if both shoulders feel the same.

"['soak the beans', 'replace the water', 'add the bacon', 'if desired', 'bring the pot of beans to a boil', 'let simmer until tender', 'add desired seasonings', 'serve']",How to Cook Adzuki Beans1," Place the beans in a large stockpot and fill the pot with water. Allow the beans to soak in the water at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours.With most dried beans, it is recommended that you soak the beans before cooking them. Doing so softens the beans and also removes most of the water-soluble components responsible for digestive upset. Note that with adzuki beans, however, you can often skip the soaking process without suffering adverse reactions. Soaking will make the beans slightly easier to digest, but it is not absolutely essential. You can soak the beans anywhere from 1 hour to overnight.; , Drain the water by pouring the contents of the pot through a colander. Rinse the adzuki beans several times under running water before returning them to the pot and adding fresh water.   The water will need to cover the beans by about 2 inches (5 cm). Fill the stockpot with cold water so that the beans cook more evenly.  , If you want to add bacon to the beans, you can do so at this point. Cut the bacon into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces and place it directly into the pot of water and beans.Bacon gives the adzuki beans a smoky, salty flavor. As such, this works well if you intend to eat the beans on their own or want to add them to a hearty dish, like chili. It may not work so well if you intend to use them in a sweeter or milder dish.  , Cover the stockpot and bring the water up to a boil over high heat.  , As soon as the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium and let the beans continue to simmer until they become tender enough to pierce with a fork.   If you soaked the adzuki beans beforehand, this should only take about 60 minutes. If you did not soak the beans or soaked them for less than an hour, you might need to wait closer to 90 minutes. Tilt the lid slightly as the beans simmer so that steam can escape, thereby avoiding a build-up of pressure. Periodically skim off excess foam that rises to the top of the water as the beans cook. If necessary, add more water if too much of it seems to escape during the cooking process.  , The beans can be served or added to recipes as they are, but if you want something a little more flavorful, you can add salt, black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, or your other favorite bean seasonings after turning off the heat and draining the beans.   You should drain the beans before adding your seasonings to ensure that the seasonings stick to the beans and do not get lost or diluted in the water.  , Drain the beans, if you have not done so in the seasoning step, and serve the beans while still hot.   You can serve adzuki beans in tortilla shells, in a bowl with a side of cornbread, or with cooked rice. The beans can also be added to casseroles, bakes, chili, and stew. Alternatively, you can cool the beans and add them to fresh salads. You can store cooked adzuki beans in airtight containers for five days in the refrigerator or six months in the freezer.

Triggers are different substances or events that cause your airways to become more inflamed, causing an attack. In order to write a detailed action plan, you need to be able to list all your triggers and how much they affect you. As time passes, keep a lookout for any new triggers and add them to your plan. Common triggers can include:   Irritants from cigarette smoke, chemicals in the air, fumes from cleaning and beauty products, and air pollution Allergens from animal fur, dust, mold, cockroaches, grasses, trees, and flowers Sickness such as colds and other viral infections of the lungs Conditions such stress, heartburn (acid reflux), and sleep apnea Medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nonselective beta-blockers Exertion from exercise and other physical activities Dry or cold air; , A peak flow meter is a hand-held device that tests how well your lungs are working day to day. You should include a space on the action plan for recording your peak flow rate every day to check if your asthma is getting worse. Talk to your doctor about getting a peak flow meter.   A low measurement on a peak flow meter is an indication that your lungs are not working as well as they should be., When you start to write your action plan, you need all of the relevant information that will help take care of an attack. These relevant facts include:   A list of all the medications you are taking, both long-term and short-term What your ideal peak flow measurements are, which may be used with moderate to severe asthma patients and will be determined by your doctor. Names and numbers of emergency contacts, which should include a loved ones, your doctor, and your local hospital, Your asthma action plan requires you to understanding your condition and know your asthma history. The plan is a written document that outlines the steps you need to take in order to deal with your asthma and stop it from getting worse. You need your doctor and respiratory therapist to help you outline the best set of steps to help treat your asthma anywhere you go.   In preparation for your plan, you doctor may have you track your symptoms so you know what triggers you the most and to what extent. Your plan will outline the three levels of urgency when dealing with an asthma attack and give you guidelines on when you need to call your doctor or seek emergency medical attention.If you want a base action plan to start from, you can download one from the American Lung Association.  , The American Lung Association recommends that your action plan be divided into three sections called zones. These zones reflect the severity of your asthma attack. The Green Zone is when you have no problem breathing, you are not coughing or wheezing, and you can go about your daily activities like normal., The second section, called the Yellow Zone, is the zone that you need when you are experiencing some kind of asthma symptoms but not a full on asthma attack. You are in the Yellow Zone if you are coughing, wheezing, and a tight chest. These symptoms may also wake you up at night.   If you find yourself in the Yellow Zone, get away from any triggers, if possible and then take time to breath deep and slow down. This is the time where you might need to take some prescription quick-relief medication.  , The Red Zone, which is the most severe, means you are having an asthma attack. If you are in this zone, you are breathing fast and hard, you can't walk or talk well, and your rescue medication is not working. This is the stage where you may need emergency care if you cannot get your asthma attack under control.   This section should include any rescue medications such as inhaled corticosteroids that are prescribed by your physician.","['aap', 'doctor', 'respiratory therapist', 'triggers', 'peak flow rate', 'additional relevant information', 'green zone', 'red zone', 'plan', 'yellow zone']"
"['use the shakespearean rhyme scheme', 'write your lines in iambic pentameter.iambic pentameter is a type of poetic meter', 'meaning that it’s a way of measuring out the rhythm of a line', 'vary your meter from time to time', ""follow the shakespearean sonnet's stanzaic structure"", 'develop your stanzas thoughtfully', 'choose your subject matter carefully', 'write your shakespearean sonnet']",How to Write a Sonnet1," The Shakespearean sonnet is a good place to start if you’re a novice sonneteer because it has the most regular and straightforward rhyme scheme and structure. The rhyme scheme of a Shakespearean sonnet always follows this pattern:   ABABCDCDEFEFGGThese letters represent the sound that appears at the end of each line. So, following this pattern of alternating rhymes, we find that the last words of the first and third lines must rhyme; the second and fourth; the fifth and seventh; the sixth and eighth; and so on, ending in a final rhyming couplet.; , Iambic pentameter is a very regular meter and is one of the most common meters in English-language poetry.   “Pentameter” derives from the Greek word pente (meaning five), and thus has five poetic ""feet."" Each foot is a unit of two syllables; thus, there are ten syllables in a line of pentameter. “Iambic” means that each foot is an “iamb.” Iambs are comprised of an unstressed, followed by a stressed syllable, resulting in a “ta-TUM” rhythm. The word “hel-LO” is an example of an iambic foot. So a line of iambic pentameter is a line of five iambic feet, resulting in a 10-syllable rhythm of ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM. An example of a line of iambic pentameter is “Shall I / comPARE/ thee TO / a SUM / mer's DAY?” (from Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 18”), Although the majority of the lines in a Shakespearean sonnet should be written in iambic pentameter, the rhythm can get plodding and predictable if you use it exclusively. By varying the stress pattern slightly at key moments, you can break up the pattern and make the poem more aurally interesting for the reader, and also use the variation to draw attention to key phrases in your poem.   For example, the third line of Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 18” begins with a spondee, meaning two stressed syllables in a row: TUM-TUMAfter two lines of perfect iambic pentameter, he wrote: “ROUGH WINDS / do SHAKE / the DAR / ling BUDS / of MAY” This both breaks up the rhythm for a little variation and draws attention to the roughness of the rough winds being described.  , A Shakespearean sonnet is composed of three heroic quatrains and a heroic couplet. A heroic quatrain is a group of four lines of iambic pentameter in an ABAB rhyme scheme; a heroic couplet is a group of two lines of iambic pentameter in an AA rhyme scheme.In a Shakespearean sonnet, the three heroic quatrains are the “ABAB CDCD EFEF” portion of the rhyme scheme The heroic couplet is the “GG” closing. You can separate these stanzas with blank lines, or leave them all together in an unbroken poem, but the sonnet should move as a function of these discrete stanzas.  , Although your poem should have a single focus, each stanza of the sonnet should develop the idea further. Think of each quatrain as a little thought bubble, like a paragraph, in which you explore an element of the subject of your poem. Each quatrain should build toward the final couplet, where you will have a turn, or a volta. The turn, which occurs in the 13th line of the Shakespearean sonnet, offers a resolution or insight into to the problem developed in the first three quatrains. It may help to examine an example, such as Shakespeare’s ""Sonnet 30"":   Quatrain 1 introduces the situation: Sometimes, when I think about the past, I regret the things and people I’ve lost. This quatrain uses legal terminology to get the point across: sessions and summons. Quatrain 2 begins with the transition word “Then,” suggesting that it is connected to Quatrain 1, but moving on to a further development of the idea: when I'm in a nostalgic mood like that, I can cry freely about friends who have passed away or been otherwise lost to me. In this quatrain, he uses the language of commerce to develop the idea: cancelled woe and expenses. Quatrain 3 begins again with the transition word “Then,” and further develops the idea using the language of commerce (accounts, payment): Not only do I cry, but I cry heavily, as though I’ve never mourned this loss before.  The closing couplet marks a turn with the word “But,” which suggests that this is not a continuation (like “Then”), but a new thought. There is no resolution to the problem of mourning here, but there is insight into grief and loss: to think of your memory is wonderful enough to make me feel as though I never lost anything. Again, this couplet continues the imagery of commerce (losses).  , Although you can write a Shakespearean sonnet about anything, they are traditionally love poems; you might keep this in mind if you want to write a purely traditional sonnet.   Note too that because of the top-heavy stanzaic structure of the Shakespearean sonnet, the form does not lend itself well to highly complex or abstract subjects. The turn and resolution must come quickly, in the final two lines, so choose a subject that can be easily resolved with a witty closing couplet. If you have a more contemplative subject, a Petrarchan sonnet may lend itself better to what you want to say.  , Remember to follow the rhyme scheme, to write in iambic pentameter while inserting metrical variation from time to time, and to develop the subject matter through each of the three heroic quatrains, before offering a turn and resolution/insight in the closing heroic couplet.   Use a rhyming dictionary if you have trouble finding rhymes for the ends of your lines.","['iambic pentameter.iambic pentameter', 'lines', 'rhythm', 'poetic meter', 'stanzas', 'time', 'type', 'subject matter', 'stanzaic structure', 'way', 'meter', 'line', 'shakespearean rhyme scheme', 'shakespearean sonnet']"

The best notes in the world can’t help you if you don’t understand what you’re taking notes on. Remember that the objective is to learn, so don’t be afraid to ask questions.Some professors may ask for you to hold your questions until after the lecture. Make sure to write them down to help you recall what you wanted to ask when the time comes. If you aren’t comfortable speaking in front of the class, try approaching your teacher after class to clarify things you are unsure of.; , In order to take effective notes, you will need to learn to pick out the important portions of what your teacher or professor says during their lecture. Disregard conversational material and focus on things your teacher places an emphasis on during class. Make sure to make note of any new topic, questions you have, and anything the teacher places a large emphasis on while covering the course material.If there was assigned reading prior to the class, make note of anything covered in the lecture that differs from how it was presented in the book. Your teacher likely wants you to follow the methodology taught in class. Things teachers write out on the board are usually important and should be considered when note taking. Make sure to record new topics, formulas needed to solve equations, and anything the teacher suggests is important.  , Taking great notes can help you to retain information in the first place, but studying for an exam or test should always include a thorough review of your notes. You should always go over your notes again after class, then refresh your memory by reviewing them once more before a test. You may also want to compare notes with a classmate to help ensure you both took down all of the important information.Studies have shown that after a week, you can usually only recall 35% of what you learned in class. Retention and recall can drop as low as 21% after two weeks. Reviewing your notes or going over them with a friend can refresh your memory and help to ensure you retain more of the course material.  , Some people may prefer to use their laptop for note taking rather than writing by hand. If you feel as though you could write faster or take more efficient notes using a laptop computer, you should consider doing so. Some teachers and professors don’t permit open laptops in their class, so make sure laptop use is permitted before you start.Laptops can help you to organize your notes and even type them faster in some cases. Make sure you don’t allow yourself to get distracted by using other applications on your laptop during the lecture. You may want to ensure the laptop you use to take notes in math class has a keypad to record numbers faster.  , It can sometimes be hard to keep up when taking notes in class. Using an audio recorder during class can allow you to revisit portions of the lecture that you may have missed, or listen to the entire class again while you’re studying to help clarify topics or refresh them in your mind.If your teacher or professor does not address the use of recording devices ahead of time, you may want to ask them before recording them. Digital recorders often allow you to transfer recordings to a computer to better control which portions you want to listen to.  , When taking notes, it’s perfectly normal to skip unnecessary words, use abbreviations or even come up with your own shorthand. However, don’t allow yourself to skip steps when writing out how to complete math problems, or copying them from the board.Although you may know how to complete a problem in class, you might have trouble remembering how to in the future. Writing out all of your work will help you to recall each step in the future.  , There are a number of ways you can incorporate different colors into your note taking methods to emphasize the importance of sections or to help you organize your notes. Use different colors to write titles, draw lines between sections, or to help you pick out important elements.Use a highlighter to highlight important things as you take notes or after class when reviewing them. Try different colored pens for titles or to add emphasis to sections. Use markers or colored pencils to make colorful divisions between topics or sections.  , Sometimes the concepts you need to take notes on in math class involve more than just numbers and equations. When your teacher or professor is going over concepts that require you to take notes that aren’t math problems themselves, use a form of shorthand to limit how much you have to write.Try leaving out unimportant words. An example could be, instead of writing “Pythagoras made influential contributions to mathematics,” try simply writing, “Pythagoras was influential.” Use abbreviations and punctuation to reduce your writing. Your notes only need to make sense to you, so feel free to use + (plus) signs instead of the word “and,” km instead of kilometers, or any other abbreviations you can easily understand.

Place emphasis on conducting the task repeatedly to standard if you are weak at a specific task. This process develops your “muscle memory” to the point where focused conscience thought is not required. The action becomes a reflex or habit.; , If you want to learn how to use a vehicle, in particular, helicopters and jets, you should practice off-line. Both types of aircraft can be difficult to master. Don’t degrade other peoples’ on-line gaming experience, handicap your team by using a piece of valuable equipment, or lower your own global stats by practicing on a 64/64 ranked server. Instead, start a ""local"" server, and join the game. The game won't start because there is only 1 player, but you can use all the equipment you want without fear of another player (in multi-player) or a bot (in single-player) getting to it first. Another option is to find empty servers, or servers where the game hasn't started due to insufficient players.  , You can learn a lot by watching other players. Take note of successful actions and put it into your kit bag.  , Know where you should and should not go when moving across the map or assaulting a position. This is invaluable information to preserve your soldier’s life and to terminate the lives of enemy soldiers.  , When you are prone, you accomplish two very important things. First, you are a smaller, more difficult target to hit. Second, your weapon has greater stability and therefore is more accurate (a tighter shot group). You will survive longer and get more kills by going prone. You can also go prone when going down a steep hill, and you will slide down the hill instead of falling and getting injured.  , Never under-estimate the benefits of crawling in the prone. Sure, it takes longer, but it can keep you from getting killed. The enemy can’t kill you if he is not able to detect your presence.  , Using crouch can provide concealment behind some vegetation and cover behind some walls. Crouch will also improve your accuracy versus firing standing (off-hand).  , Use cover and concealment to mask your movement and position. Don't just stop in the middle of a street and start firing. You won’t last long. Take into consideration the enemy commander’s scan and overhead satellite viewing ability. When the enemy commander scans, he may or may not have the time to check-out your position. If he does check out your position, the concealment of a tree may place doubt as to your exact location. Another consideration is artillery. Concrete buildings and corrugated steel hangers and shelters will provide cover (protection) from artillery.  , When you double-tap your move “forward"" key (default is W), or hit the ""sprint"" key (default is SHIFT) you will move at a much faster pace. On the lower left corner of your screen, you will see a sprint meter that indicates your endurance level to maintain a sprint. Different units have different levels of endurance. Kits with body armor are Assault and Anti-armor and have less endurance compared with Special Ops and Medics. Use your sprint power wisely. Identify your route and next position before you depart your current covered and concealed position. Once identified, sprint across open areas to your next covered and concealed position. Ensure you wait for your sprint meter to replenish fully, then sprint again. This way, you will be set-up for success in case you have to sprint farther than you thought, or have to sprint back to cover.  , Ensure you are always looking around. Be familiar with your surroundings. Identify your next target or prevent being the next KIA (Killed In Action).  , Are you almost out of ammo or health? Switch Kits. Stand close to a kit and press the pick up equipment key (Default X). This works for friend and foe kits. And you can switch back, if you like your original kit better. Did the medic player next to you just go down? Grab his kit and revive him.  , If you select again a weapon you have already selected, you can toggle between single-shot or full automatic mode (usually key “3”). The firing mode indicator is in the bottom right corner near your ammo meter. The selector mode indicator will display single, burst, or auto depending on the weapon type. Most players leave their weapons in full auto mode. However, there is an accuracy penalty when in full auto. In single shot mode, you are more accurate with each shot. At very close range, it won't make much difference. At more than 10 yrs, consider going to the prone, using single shot mode, using your sights, and going for the head.  , Even if you prefer being in full auto all the time, use short, controlled bursts rather than just holding down the fire key. You'll be more accurate and it will give you time to re-orient your crosshairs or iron sights. If you hold down the fire key, the weapon will climb higher and higher as you continue to fire. Vehicle and stationary machine guns have an overheat meter. Scanning, burst your fire, and reorienting will prevent overheating. If your enemy is prone, shoot a yard in front of him so the rise of your weapon will get him right in the head.  , When you right-click, you look through the gun sights or scope, which makes you more accurate, especially at longer range. Caution – using your sights also degrades your speed of movement.  , Even if you aren't a sniper, fire at someone's head rather than at their body. Some players are wearing body armor, depending on the unit class of the enemy. The body armor will take several rounds to penetrate.  , Shoot only if you have a chance of actually taking down your target. Don't just fire at distant enemy personnel because you can see them. If you do fire and miss, now they can see you. Wait until they are within a range of actually getting a kill before you fire.  , If your enemy has good cover, or you can't tell exactly where he is, toss a grenade his way to flush him out or soften him up for a rush attack.  , Don't wait for the automatic reload if you are running low on ammo. Get to a stopping point with some cover, and reload so that you won't get stuck in the middle of a firefight with no bullets (rounds).  , If you find yourself out of ammo in your main weapon, and your enemy is still not down, it is faster to pull out your pistol and use it than to wait on reloading.  , If you are at very close range, try switching to knife. It will take out your enemy quicker than firing at them. One hit and he is dead.  , You’re wasting ammo and, more importantly, you are giving away your position. Your bullets won’t penetrate an armored vehicle’s armor. Spot the vehicle for others with more capable weapon systems to engage and destroy. Use your grenades as a last resort.  , Let your teammates know where the enemy is by spotting them. Go to your commo rose feature (default Q key). Look and select the center option. If the Heads Up Display (HUD) (top right corner) is presenting ""?"" question marks on your enemy spottings, you are not putting the cross hairs on the target when spotting. Sometimes the enemy is behind a building or moving really fast and you will not be able to get a good spot. Put the cross hairs close to the target, right click the spot option on the commo rose, a drop down menu will appear with enemy types like tank, sniper, and helicopter, and select the desired type of enemy. Using the right click feature will communicate your sighting to all of your teammates.  , Sometimes players get so focused they forget to look around and see what else is around. Slow down and be deliberate in your movement. See who can get you before they can score an easy kill.  , Different situations require different kits. For example, if you are in a street-fight map and your team has access to very little armor, therefore, you aren’t going to get much use out of an engineer. By the same token, if there is lots of enemy armor, your going to be invaluable with the anti-tank kit. Be flexible and willing to change your duty position to address the situation.  , There are multiple ways to communicate with your teammates. The integrated methods are: text messaging, voice (VoIP), commo roses, orders from your squad leader on your HUD, and identifying enemy on your HUD from UAV and individual player ""spots"".  , Surprisingly, there are a lot of people who do not have a microphone and still choose to use text messaging. So watch your screen. Your teammates or Squad Leader may be talking to you!  , You and your teammates will have a better gaming experience by using VoIP. Talking in a concise professional manner is much faster than typing and it can be a lot of fun sharing chatter of just having launched an enemy soldier 15 feet (4.6 m) into the air by the effective use of a sabot round from your tank's main gun.  , There is the ever-present blue, green, or red tag hovering over a soldier or vehicle that just won’t go away. It tells you if he is a good guy or a bad guy. Blue is good and on your team, green is good and in your squad, red is bad and begs to be exterminated. Put the red tagged devils out of their misery promptly. Use your cross hairs to interrogate the target and the tag should show up. The tag also tells you the screen name, both friend and foe. It is also important to watch for the uniform color. The Chinese/MEC uniforms are dark, while the US uniforms are light.

"['buy an upgrade', 'become a frequent flier', 'check in at the airport kiosk', 'check in early', 'get bumped!', 'find discounted tickets', 'plan long-term', 'book directly with the airline', 'buy a full fare coach ticket and ask for a first class seat', 'shop around']",How to Get an Upgrade to First Class1," This is by far the easiest, most sure-fire way to get an upgrade. However, unless you fly often with the airline and have earned elite status, it's also the most expensive way to enjoy the perks of first class.; , Airlines categorize their customers based on how often they fly—or more to the point, how much they spend!   At 50k miles a year, you are in the middle of the ""elite"" zone, a position that makes you important to the airline. You'll be rewarded with various perks along the way—from quick check-ins, to bonus miles, to first-class upgrades. If you don't normally travel a lot for business or pleasure, consider ""mileage running."" This is the process of finding cheap, long flights and taking them whenever possible. The destination is not important—only the distance. A good rule of thumb for determining if a mileage run is worth it is if the price-per-mile cost is $.02 or below. Check out online resources such as Farecompare for prices and opportunities.You might also consider whether you fly frequently enough to maintain elite status.  , Arrive at the airport a couple hours early, and check in using the airline's kiosk. You will be able to modify your seat assignment as available, and if there are any first-class seats available, you may be able to purchase an upgrade at a significantly reduced cost.  , When there is one upgrade available and two elite flyers are requesting it, all else being equal: the one who checks in first gets it. You must have elite status with the airline for this to work.  , Take advantage of opportunities that arise during the normal course of travel. All airlines over-book flights, and sometimes, when they least expect it, everybody shows up for the flight. When that happens, they have to find people willing to be bumped from that flight. That could be you!   If the flight is very overbooked, your bargaining position is strong. Approach the gate agent, and be as genuinely charming and sympathetic as you can be. Ask them if they would consider rebooking you in return for an upgrade voucher in addition to whatever other incentives they might be offering. This will be more likely to work if you don't have checked baggage, which would entail much more work on the part of the airlines in order to bump you.  , Some airlines have relaxed upgrade policies for full-fare coach tickets. You may also have friends who have upgrade vouchers they may be willing to sell.  , If you are a regular flier, are considering doing mileage runs, and are planning a big trip that you want to enjoy in first-class style, you can also purchase miles directly from the airlines.   Visit your airline's website, and locate the ""Purchase Miles"" page, generally located in the frequent-flier part of the site. Enter your account number, and how many miles you wish to purchase.  , When you book directly with the airline, there is the possibility of also adding an OSI (Other Significant Information) notation to your record.   Based on that, ask about the possibility of an upgrade to first class. If you are a travel agent, travel writer, event planner, or captain of industry, it certainly won’t hurt your chances!  , Many airlines have a fare code that automatically grants first class privileges, but you have to ask. Call the airline directly and ask them how much a coach class ticket with first class seating privilege will cost. This will be much less than a first class ticket. Be careful though, like most coach tickets it will probably be non-refundable.  , Reward airlines that have reasonable prices for business-class travel. As with any airline, if you fly frequently, they appreciate your business, and a struggling upstart might appreciate your business even more.

"['join a support group for people who are deaf or hard of hearing', 'attend an event for the deaf', 'join an organization that supports the deaf community', 'go to an asl class', 'pursue friendships with hearing people', 'too', 'be open to explaining your hearing loss']",How to Make Friends if You're Deaf or Hard of Hearing2," The deaf community faces adversity, and as such, a variety of support groups are available. You may meet people who have recently become deaf or hard of hearing or have been like that their entire life. You’re likely to meet someone who has had a similar experience to yours.  Ask someone to get coffee or a bite to eat after the group to make a new friend. Make this attempt with someone whom you feel you can make a connection with. However, don’t take this step until you feel like you really know this person. You may also want to set up a group function to begin with, instead of a one-on-one meeting.Locate a group that matches your circumstances. Many national organizations offer local support groups like the AG Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)., Some establishments, such as restaurants, clubs, and theatres, may hold a night in which their activities are catered to the deaf. Not only is this a great way to meet new people, but you’ll likely make a lot of friends in the process.Look online to search for events like this that are happening in your area. Take a friend—hearing or not—to go with you if you’re feeling shy or unconfident.  , You’re sure to get in touch with people you can become friends with if you join an organization that supports the rights of the deaf or hard of hearing. You share the same beliefs and likely want the same end goal.  The National Association of the Deaf is a good resource and place to start. You may be able to volunteer your time there and become friends with people who are well known in the deaf community., People who have recently become deaf or hard of hearing often attend American Sign Language (ASL) classes so they can learn about this type of communication. Consider attending such a class if you find yourself in the same situation. You may form a relationship and create a bond with someone who has also found themselves experiencing this significant life change.Consider teaching a class if you are fluent in ASL. Along with educating people, you may make a new friend.  , It may seem like a struggle, but deaf-hearing friendships are possible. This may be necessary if you go to a school or work in a job where you are the only person with hearing loss. Either way, it's great to have friends from all walks of life.Participate in a club or organization at your school like the drama club. Connect with others who have the same interests, such as joining a local Meetup for hikers.  , Many hearing people may shy away from making friends because they don't know how to communicate with you appropriately. If you take initiative to start conversations with them, they will feel more inclined to starting a friendship.Send a message to someone you find interesting on social media saying ""Hi."" Keep a notepad or your phone handy so you can pass ""notes"" to hearing people that you meet in-person. Let them know your preferred form of communication. For example, many teens enjoy texting anyway, so it won't be so odd to text a new pal back and forth.

"['decide if you want to design your flyer digitally or manually', 'use color if you can', 'determine a size for the flyer', 'determine where and how to distribute your flyer', 'write a headline', 'make it big!', 'consider using capital letters or bold fonts', 'keep the message very simple', 'add a subtitle', 'add detail', 'drive home your message with testimonials', 'add emphasis', 'organize your copy', 'use other eye-catching fonts', 'include your contact information', 'add a picture or a graphic', 'find an easily accessible image', 'use an image-editing application to increase contrast', 'place a description below the image', 'include a visual frame or border around your picture', 'make sure your flyer works', 'make copies', 'post your flyer']",How to Make a Flyer," You can design a flyer digitally with tools such as Photoshop or Microsoft Publisher. Alternatively, you could design a flyer with pen, pencil, markers, etc., and then photocopy the flier at a copy shop.  , It could be color in the writing, images, even the paper you print on. Color draws the eye and gets attention. Printing in grayscale on color paper can also be a cost-effective alternative to adding color to your flyers.   A color scheme can be very effective.Use a color wheel to come up with basic color harmonies. For example, you could stick to analogous colors (adjacent ones on the color wheel), like different shades of blues and greens. Or, you could use complementary colors, such as red and green.A color matching the image you use in the flyer is even better. For example, if your picture shows a sunrise, you could use oranges and yellows. To make the yellow letters pop, they could be outlined in black.  , Flyer size depends in large part on the function of the flyer and your ability to produce flyers of a certain size. It’s easiest to print digital flyers on printer size paper (8.5 x 11 inches). So, your flyers can be that size, or you might want to cut them in half or quarters if your flyer doesn’t need to be as big (e.g. if it’s a handout). Your fliers can be any size, though, and you can make larger size flyers relatively easily if you’re going to a printer that prints that size.  , Are you planning on hanging your flyer inside on a bulletin board or outside on a telephone pole? Maybe you plan on handing out flyers at an event or in a busy part of town. Maybe you’re even using the flyers for a mailing. If the flyers are to be hung outdoors, consider printing on stronger paper and with waterproof ink.  , Make it big, bold, and simple. In general, the headline should be no more than a few words, fit in one line across the page, and be centered. A headline can be longer, but the briefer it is, the better the chance it has to capture someone’s attention.  , The lettering in the headline should be bigger than any other lettering on the flyer. You want most people to be able to read it quickly from about 10 feet (3 meters) away. You’ll usually want the headline spaced evenly across the entire width of the page. If it doesn’t quite fit or fit nicely, consider centering the text.  , Look at any newspaper's front-page headline; that industry figured this out a long time ago. Don’t get too fancy with this font, as your primary goal here is readability. You can add flair to other parts of the flyer if it adds to your message.  , You are trying to grab attention with your flyer, and convey your message in often fractions of a second. Complicated messages and content will likely not make an impact. More detail can follow in the body of the flyer.   Do not make people have to think deeply about the content your flyer—it should communicate your message at an almost intuitive level. Think catchy and fun. Which headline jumped out at you? If you're like most people, the ""puppies and ice cream"" caught your attention. That's not because everybody likes puppies and ice cream; it's because it is bright red, a color that naturally draws the eye. (However, obviously many people like puppies and ice cream, and the unexpected and humorous content adds to the effectiveness.)  , This should be about two or three lines. Since the title is brief and short, the subtitle elaborates on the title, providing more detail of what you’re talking about specifically. Read newspaper subtitles or even press releases for examples.  , While your headline captures people’s attention and leaves them wanting to know more, the body of your flyer is the payoff where you drive home your message. Include pertinent information like the 5 Ws: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. These are questions that people will naturally ask about your call to action. Put yourself in your audience’s position. What would you want to know?   Be direct and to-the-point. Make your description text concise but appropriately detailed.  , The body of your flyer is also a good place to include testimonials or endorsements.A good testimonial not only provides more detail, but it legitimizes your efforts through a third-party source. If a reader can read your content from your perspective or from an endorser’s perspective, they’re more likely to follow your call to action.  , To emphasize key words, use capitalization, a slightly bigger or bolder font, italics, and other visual hooks. However, do not use these options all at once; choose one or two special effects. Too much creative formatting may look juvenile at best and a bit insane at worst.   Use words and phrases that might make your offer more enticing: ""FREE"", ""NEW"", ""REWARD,"" etc. These are enticing, but also eye-catching, and they can encourage viewers to follow your call to action. Of course, only include these terms if they actually hold true to your advertisement. You don’t want to mislead your audience. Use the word “you”. This way, you’ll be appealing directly to the reader., Add bullet points to organize your message. Boxes surrounding your copy or bullet points can also provide organization, while adding visual appeal.These effects might also make your copy look more professional or business-like, which might be important to your overall look and feel.  , The copy in the body of your flyer does not have to be the same as that of your headlines. Your flyer may have to stand out, so using something different than everyone else may be smart. Your word processor should already be loaded with a number of font options, but if they don’t have exactly what you have in mind, consider downloading a new font. Many sites offer free and easy downloads of unusual and unique fonts.  , Include your contact info—preferably at the bottom of your flyer, so that the flyer’s most important information remains at the top. Add your first name and whatever form of contact you prefer: phone number and/or email address are most common.   You can also use the time-honored ""tear-off"" method: create a condensed version of your flyer text in a smaller font, rotate it 90 degrees and repeat it several times across the bottom of the flyer. Make a partial cut between each occurrence so people can tear off the contact information conveniently. Do not put any information that is private. Do not, for instance, use your last name or give a home address.  , A picture is often as important as any words. The human brain will often notice a picture before words. Now that you have the reader's attention, take advantage of it! Give the reader something to look at—people tend to remember concrete, visual messages even more than words. So an image is an effective element, whether it is a logo, a picture of a lost dog, or a graphic.  , You don’t necessarily need to create an entirely new image. Consider using one of your own photos or using an image in the public domain that you’ve found online. Some computer programs and suites, such as Microsoft Office, also offer a variety of stock images.  , This will make the image more noticeable from a distance once it's printed on the paper. If you don't have an image editor, a free app like Picasa (http://picasa.google.com/), from Google, will work fine.   Try to use only one image if you can. If necessary, you can include two images side by side, but any more than this will make the flyer too cluttered, which makes it less likely to catch someone's eye.  , If you’ve hooked the reader, she’s coming in closer now for the details. A good caption can drive home the message of the image. It can also serve to reinforce or add detail to the compelling stand-alone copy you’ve included on the flyer.  , Framing your picture might help “anchor” it to the flyer, instead of just having it float out there as a stand-alone insert. Consider inserting a border or light shadow around it. For emphasis, you might even include stars or an arrow pointing to your picture.  , Before making a lot of copies of your flyer, test it out by taping it up on a door to review it yourself. Stand back from it about 10 feet (3 meters) and have a look. Do the main points jump out at you? Looking at the sample flyer here, you can see immediately that it is for a lost dog.   Proofread the entire flyer to make sure all the information is accurate and the spelling and grammar are correct.A good way to critique is to ask a friend or family member who has not seen your flyer to take a look at it, and see if they get its message right away.  , Now that you've completed your flyer and tested it, print as many copies as you need.   If it's too many for your printer to handle, or if you're expecting rain (the ink output of most home printers will run if left in the rain), find a local copy or office supply store and use a self-serve copier. Black-and-white copies are generally cheaper than color, but do not have the same impact as color. If you decide to go with black-and-white, you might try this: instead of printing the headline and any colored words, leave those sections blank and write them in by hand with a colored marker. Even using a highlighter works well.  , Where should you post it? Well, where are the people who you want to reach?   If you lost your kitty in your neighborhood, post your flyer on telephone poles, bus stops, the local convenience store, the coffee shop, laundromat, at local swimming pools, and any other nearby gathering places. If you lost your purse downtown, post flyers as near as possible to the last place where you know you had your purse. Note that in urban areas there are often restrictions on what you can post, and where––since it's easy to find you, don't flaunt the regulations! Try coffee shops, public bulletin boards, and if you see a pole that's covered with flyers—it's fair game! If you are trying to reach a college or other school audience for your club, generally there are rules and even traditional places to put postings. It is usually a combination of what works (hallways, the doors to bathrooms, homeroom hand-outs) and rules about where it is acceptable to post these things.

"['refrain from trying to control the other person’s behavior', 'avoid commenting on the other person’s behavior and appearance', 'avoid “fat-shaming” or “skinny-shaming.” the healthy body weight for each person may differ', 'avoid simplifying the matter', 'avoid perfectionistic tendencies', 'do not promise to “keep it a secret.” it may be tempting to agree to keep your loved one’s disorder a secret in order to gain his/her trust']",How to Tell if Someone Is Anorexic5," Do not try to force the other person to eat. Don’t bribe your loved one to eat more, or use threats to compel behavior. Sometimes, anorexia is a response to a lack of feeling control over one’s own life. Engaging in a power struggle or taking control away from your loved one may only make the problem worse.Don’t try to “fix” your loved one’s problem. Recovery is as complex as the eating disorder. Trying to “fix” your loved one on your own may do more harm than good. Encourage him/her to see a mental health professional, instead.  , Anorexia often involves a great deal of shame and embarrassment for the person suffering from it. Even if well-meaning, commenting on your loved one’s appearance, eating habits, weight, etc., can trigger his/her feelings of shame and disgust.   Compliments are also unhelpful. Because the person is dealing with a distorted body image, s/he is unlikely to believe you. S/he may interpret even positive comments as judgment or manipulation., If your loved one comments that s/he feels “fat,” it’s important not to respond by saying things like, “You’re not fat.” This only reinforces the unhealthy idea that “fat” is something innately bad that should be feared and avoided.Similarly, do not point out thin people and comment on their appearance, such as “Nobody wants to hug a bony person.” You want your loved one to develop a healthy body image, not focus on fearing or diminishing one particular type of body. Instead, ask your loved one where those feelings are coming from. Ask what s/he thinks s/he would gain by being thin, or what s/he fears about feeling overweight.  , Anorexia and other eating disorders are highly complex and often co-occur with other illnesses, such as anxiety and depression. Peer and media pressure may play a role, as may family and social situations. Saying things such as “If you would just eat more, things would be fine” ignore the complexity of the issue your loved one is struggling with.   Instead, offer your support with “I”-statements: “I realize this is a tough time for you” or “Eating differently can be hard, and I believe in you.”  , The struggle to be “perfect” is a common factor in triggering anorexia. However, perfectionism is an unhealthy way of thinking that hampers your ability to adapt and be flexible, a crucial part of success in life.It holds you and others to an impossible, unrealistic, and ever-shifting standard.Do not expect perfection from your loved one or yourself. Recovering from an eating disorder may take a long time, and both of you will have times when you act in a way that you regret.   Acknowledge when one of you slips up, but don’t focus on it or beat yourself up for it. Instead, focus on what you can do going forward to avoid similar mistakes.  , However, you do not want to help promote your loved one’s behavior. Anorexia may cause early death in up to 20% of its sufferers.It’s important to encourage your loved one to get help.

You should not contact each reporting agency separately to get the report. Instead, you can use one of the following methods for requesting the free annual report:Call 1-877-322-8228. Your credit report will be delivered by U.S. mail. Visit annualcreditreport.com and request a report. Request a copy of your report by mailing a written request to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. You can complete and mail in the Federal Trade Commission’s form available at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf.; , Once you receive your report, you should review it closely to find any errors. Common errors that can negatively impact your credit score include:late or missed payments erroneously reported loan modifications reported as “foreclosures” closed cards reported as “closed by grantor” bad debts more than seven years old still showing on your credit report  , Each creditor’s address should be listed on the credit report. However, if one is not listed, then you should contact the credit reporting agency and ask for the address.  , Try to find whatever documents you can that support your position that the item is erroneous. For example, if the creditor claims that you missed a payment, then find cancelled checks or statements that show payment. If you requested that a credit card be closed, look for any letters from the credit card company to that effect.   You may also have loan modification documents, which show that you were not foreclosed on.  , Open a blank word processing document to begin your letter. You should insert your address first, aligning it on the left-hand margin. After typing the address, move down two lines and enter the date.Two lines underneath the date, you should enter the creditor’s address.  , If you know the name of a contact person, then you can use it. Otherwise, you should simply type “Dear Sir or Madam” and add a colon afterwards., In the first paragraph, make sure to explicitly state why you are writing. For example, you can type “I am writing to dispute the following information in my file. I have highlighted the items I wish to dispute on the attached copy of my credit report.”, In the second paragraph, you can identify what items you want the creditor to investigate. Also request that the creditor remove the item from your report.   You can write, “The item listing ‘60 days past due’ is inaccurate because I paid my account within the 30-day period. I am requesting that you remove the item to correct the information.”, In the third paragraph, tell the creditor what documents you have enclosed that support your position. Be sure to send photocopies as the creditor probably will not return originals. If you do not have any supporting documentation, then you can skip this step.   Sample language: “Enclosed are copies of three cancelled checks that cover the period in question. Please reinvestigate this matter and delete the disputed item as soon as possible.”, End the letter with “Sincerely,” and then space down three lines before typing your name.You can sign the letter in blue or black ink.   At the very bottom of the page, you can type “Enclosure:” and then list any enclosures., You want to keep copies of all communications with the creditor. For this reason, it is better to dispute with a letter than to submit disputes over the phone or online.Even when a creditor insists that you use an online reporting system, you should still follow up with a letter.  , You should send the letter first class, return receipt requested.The receipt will serve as proof that the creditor received the letter.   Be sure to attach any supporting documentation, such as a copy of your credit report., It is not enough to send a dispute letter only to the creditor. You should also send the letter to the three credit reporting agencies. By sending to the credit reporting agencies, you trigger potential liability for the creditor and the credit reporting agency if they do not properly investigate and get back to you.For instructions on how to contact the CRAs, you can see Dispute Credit Report Errors.  , The credit reporting agencies have between 30-45 days to investigate and then report back to you. Even though you sent a letter to the creditor, the CRA will also forward the dispute to the creditor to investigate. If the creditor cannot verify the information or simply fails to respond to the CRA, then you will win and the disputed item will be removed from your credit report.If you do not hear back within 45 days, then you should send a follow up with another letter. Be sure to send a copy of the original letter as well.In the follow-up letter, ask that the creditor or CRA update you on the status of the investigation. As always, keep copies of your communications and mail all letters first class, return receipt requested.

You can get a quick taste of the restaurant’s personality and faire this way. If you have the time, you may find it useful to look at a restaurant’s website for a menu and prices. Be sure to ask a friend or your favorite bartender; word of mouth is the strongest praise available and a good place to start.; , Companies like Yelp, Google Reviews, and Trip Advisor offer a great resource to those who are trying to find the best restaurant. There are a number of signs to look out for on these websites on order to determine the quality of restaurant.Look out for the number of stars on the review. Any restaurant worth its salt will have at least three and a half stars, but ideally you should look out for four or above. Read a sample of reviews to see what the pros and cons of a restaurant. Reviews offer a great way to see what the best dishes as photos are often included with the reviews. Be sure to check the dates of the reviews. Some restaurants have changes in management so the content of the reviews may change depending on the date.  , For example, if you are a vegetarian, have nut allergies, or have celiac's disease it's crucial to carefully read over the menu to see if there will be an adequate number of options. Also consider calling the restaurant to see if they have any dietary substitutions that aren't listed on the menu.  , While few restaurants will outright refuse you for being underdressed, it's still important to dress the part if you're eating at an upscale establishment. Check out the restaurant's website to see what kind of dress code to expect.   Jacket required. This is generally the highest dress code restaurants will require. This means the man is expected to wear a formal jacket such as a sports coat or blazer, while a woman should wear the equivalent such as a gowns, dresses, or even pantsuits. Formal attire. For restaurants requiring formal attire, this dress code can be slightly more varied than a jacket required code. Women could wear cocktail dresses or more comfortable long dresses. Men should still wear something like a sport coat, but nice slacks and a tucked in button-down shirt would generally be acceptable. Formal-casual. Many restaurants will specify something in-between the fanciest and the most low-key establishments. Examples of formal-casual or casual elegant could be turtlenecks, nice sweaters, a simple black dress, button-down shirt with a light sports coat, darker colors, leather shoes, or jewelry. Casual. While casual is the most relaxed requirement for dress code, it doesn't mean you should wear sweaty, ripped clothing. Something as simple as a fresh t-shirt and a clean pair of jeans with sneakers is acceptable. Remember to keep up basic hygiene too. Casual doesn't mean you can spread body odor through the restaurant. , When you have decided on a place, make a reservation—even if it is only 15 minutes before when you would like to eat. This is a common courtesy and gives the host or employee answering the phone an opportunity to share any pertinent information about the night. Oftentimes, the restaurant will relay if there is a set special, fixed menu, or charitable event for the evening. The host also may suggest a preferred time to come, letting you know when you will get the most care and attentive service. Now would also be an opportune time to inform the restaurant and kitchen of any important dietary restrictions or serious allergies.  , Just as in the case of a doctor’s visit or a job interview, arrive a few minutes early. This simple bit of pre-planning allows the restaurant to run a smooth schedule so other patrons aren't kept waiting longer. If you are running considerably late, be sure to inform the restaurant.  , Restaurants located in busy downtown centers may have a lack of parking so you need to consider whether it's necessary to bring extra money for parking decks or valets. Consider taking public transportation or calling a taxi if the parking situation looks especially dire so you don't spend more time circling for a space then you do eating your food.  , if your table isn’t ready or they look particularly busy. A bit of empathy and a small nonchalant gesture of good will can go a long way toward assuaging a flustered restaurant worker who is momentary overwhelmed. With any luck, you may even be given a complimentary drink or small offering from the kitchen as thanks.  , If your server immediately asks you for your drinks and you're not sure, consider asking for a water while you look over the drink menu. It's important not to get flustered and order something you're not completely satisfied with just because your server rushed to the table.  , Many restaurants will have rotating specials that can offer tasty surprises. Ask about the vegetable, fish, or soup of the day as well to make sure you're not missing out on the freshest ingredients or rare entrees.  , Usually, by the time that the server brings your beverages, you can begin to order appetizer. This is where looking at the restaurant’s menu online prior to arriving has its advantages—especially if you are pressed for time.   Be as specific as possible with your order. Make sure you've notified your server of any allergies you have, you would like the meat cooked, and any special changes from the way the item is listed. Check to see if substitutions are allowed. Some establishments take great pride in their menu options and don't allow any changes made to the entrees. Respect this mandate if substitutions aren't acceptable. If you're done ordering food, be sure to gather your menus and hand them to the server at the end of your order. , Servers have a detailed knowledge of the best options so it's always a good idea to pick their brain for ideas. Don't be afraid to take their suggestions if it's a dish that's foreign to you.  , One of the quickest to get on your servers bad side is to order the chicken and the switch to the steak after the cooks have already started. Take your time to make sure you're happy with the dish in order to make the restaurant run as smoothly as possible. , Timing is a key factor in a good dining experience, and, in order to hedge your bets, it is helpful to place orders at times when the server can give your request their full attention. Make an effort to speak clearly and be decisive.  , Shared plates are an increasingly common phenomenon, and it can be easy to make a culinary faux pas when a number of mouth-watering dishes hit the table, but remember to use the appropriate utensil and eat from your plate and not the serving platter. Naturally, the level of decorum and scrutiny to it depend on the kind of restaurant and your company. Nobody expects you to eat barbecue spareribs with a knife and fork., Certain restaurants will offer a variety of utensils that can seem intimidating if you're not familiar with their uses. Take care to think about the different sizes of spoons, as well as alternative utensils such as chopsticks.   Small stirring spoons are often used for coffee and teas. Obviously, these spoons should only be used for your drink. Soup spoons are deeper and more rounded. They are specifically shaped to ease the process of consuming your soup and are not recommended for other uses. A place spoon is about 7 inches long and is an all-purpose spoon. This is the most common spoon used at restaurants and can be used for entrees, soups, and desserts alike. Salad spoons have an elongated shape that are formulated to make salads easier to serve. They can occasionally be chilled as well. , Be sure to address any problems about the food with your server; a patron may want something sent back to the kitchen to be made again with or without an ingredient. By being straightforward and open about what you would like, the restaurant staff can attempt to correct the problem quickly and efficiently. If a serious error has been or a dead bug ended up in your entree, don't be afraid to ask for a free appetizer in order to compensate for unsanitary dining experience.  , If you enjoyed your food, be sure to send your thanks to the back-of-house staff as well. In some places, you can specifically tip them, and in most others, you can buy them a round of drinks that they can have after their shift.  , Make sure everyone is clear who is paying for what so you're not in an awkward situation where someone doesn't have enough money to pay for their food. This is also crucial so you can easily explain to your server how you want the check divided when it comes time for payment.  , Your server may bring the bill without being asked, or they may wait for you to initiate it so that they do need seem like they are rushing you out of the restaurant. If you have the time, try one of life’s small luxuries and order an after-dinner coffee, espresso, or digestif while waiting for the bill to arrive.  , The end of a meal—especially one between a number of separately paying parties—can be a hectic time, and a mistake may have been made. Ensure that you are paying the correct amount.  , The server will bring back any change if necessary. Remember that in the United States, a tip for the server is expected to be about 20% of the total bill. If they have given you excellent service above and beyond what was expected of them, you can give them more.","['errors', 'food order', 'credit card', 'drink', 'dinner', 'appropriate times', 'kitchen team', 'food preference', 'menu', 'cash', 'utensils', 'needs', 'food', 'dessert', 'daily specials', 'thanks', 'dietary restrictions', 'total', 'food orders', 'chef', 'preferred budget', 'order drinks', 'proper attire', 'place', 'bar', 'reservation', 'group', 'server', 'bill', 'parking options', 'concerns', 'payment', 'recommendations', 'manners', 'food websites']"
"['look at the shape of your fish’s fins', 'observe the color of your fish’s fins', 'examine your fish’s entire body', 'watch your fish’s behavior', 'research bacterial causes of fin rot', ""evaluate the water quality of your fish's tank"", ""identify stressors in your fish's life"", 'check your fish for signs of physical damage', 'move your sick fish to a separate tank', 'administer antibiotic treatment to your fish', 'trim the affected fins', 'keep your fish isolated', 'address the underlying conditions']",How to Identify Finrot," Fin rot usually affects a fish’s tail fin, but can also affect other fins, such as the dorsal and pectoral fins.In the early stages of fin rot, the edge of the fin will look ragged or shredded, due to the breakdown of the fin’s protective membrane.As the disease progresses, an increasing amount of the fin will be destroyed. As more of the fin erodes away, the fin may start to resemble a semicircular bite shape.If fin rot becomes severe, the fin will erode to the point of being only a stump.A hole in the affected fin usually indicates a fungal infection, which sometimes occurs simultaneously with fin rot.Be aware that you may not be able to detect fin rot until the disease is fairly advanced.; , Fins affected by fin rot become discolored. If your fish has fin rot, the edges of his fins will have an uneven, fuzzy white lining—this is a very common sign of fin rot.His fins will also develop red streaks from inflammation and bleeding.The affected areas may also have white dots,which could be indicative of a fungal infection.  , In its most severe stages, fin rot can affect other parts of your fish’s body. For example, your fish may develop abdominal swelling.You may also notice ulcers and lesions on different parts of your fish’s body.Fin rot is a bacterial disease. When the fins become damaged, the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through the damaged area and spread the disease throughout your fish’s body., Although the physical appearance of the fins is the easiest way to identify fin rot, your fish’s behavior can also give you important clues. He may become listless. He may also start rubbing against the tank’s walls or on the tank’s decorations to try to relieve his discomfort—this could actually make the disease worse by further damaging his fins.These behaviors are not specific to fin rot, but can help confirm the diagnosis if his fin damage is characteristic of this disease.  , Fin rot is caused by opportunistic bacteria (Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Flexibacter).Opportunistic bacteria are usually harmless, but can cause disease under certain conditions. The opportunistic bacteria are likely already in your fish’s tank,but will not cause disease when your fish is healthy and his tank's water quality is good.   Other bacteria linked to fin rot are Pseudomonas species and myxobacteria.  , Opportunistic bacteria will cause disease in your fish when some underlying condition weakens his body's defenses. Poor water quality is the most common underlying condition with fin rot.For example, ammonia accumulation in your fish's tank can damage his fins, creating an entry point for the bacteriaNitrate—what ammonia is broken down to during the nitrogen cycle—can also accumulate in the tank and damage your fish's fins.Decaying live plants and leftover food can increase ammonia and nitrate levels., Stress is another common underlying condition. It weakens your fish’s immune system, which reduces his ability to fight off infection.Your fish can become stressed for a number of reasons, including bullying by other fish, overcrowding, and improper human handling.Water that is too cold, as well as water pH fluctuations, can also be stressful to your fish., Physical damage is another underlying condition of fin rot. Bodily wounds create entry points for opportunistic bacteria to enter your fish's body and case disease. Fighting and fin nipping commonly result in physical damage.If you have a burrowing fish, he could easily damage his tail and fin if the bottom of his tank contains gravel instead of sand., This is relevant if you have multiple fish in one tank. Isolating the sick fish will prevent him from transmitting disease to the healthy fish. To prevent possible ammonia and nitrate accumulation, do not put substrate or live plants in the treatment tank.Use a sponge filter in the treatment tank. It is less likely than a chemical filter to filter out medications, and is unlikely to stress your fish (like a strong power filter).Place an enclosed water heater in the tank to maintain a water temperature that is recommended for your specific type of fish.An air stone will help keep the tank well oxygenated.The supplies for your treatment tank are available at your local pet store. Continue to monitor the other fish for signs for fin rot.Separate and treat them if necessary.  , In the United States, over-the-counter antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim, and sulfadimidine) are used to treat fin rot.The antibiotic is typically added directly to the tank’s water. Carefully follow the medication’s instructions to ensure effective treatment.   Outside of the United States, you may have to obtain the antibiotics through your veterinarian.It is common to use a combination of antibiotics to treat fin rot, since the disease could be caused by several types of bacteria.Methylene blue is a non-antibiotic treatment that can also be used to treat fin rot.  , Depending on the severity of fin rot, fin rot can also be treated by trimming the affected fins to remove the damaged tissue. This medical procedure requires that your fish be sedated, so you will need to schedule an appointment with your veterinarian to have this done.Your veterinarian will use sterile scissors to remove the damaged tissue. He or she will then treat the clean edge with antiseptic. Your fish may need additional treatment if fin rot has become extensive.The fin tissue is more likely to grow back with minor cases of fin rot., Your fish should remain in the treatment tank until his clinical signs have improved. A good rule of thumb is to keep him isolated for about 10 days.During this time, look for improvement in clinical signs: normal color returning to his fins, healing of ulcers and lesions on his body, normal swimming behavior.   Be mindful that the fin rot may be too severe for treatment.  , Effective treatment of fin rot involves both medical treatment and improvement of underlying conditions. Improving water quality is extremely important. Change the water to remove excess ammonia and nitrate from the tank and add fresh minerals to the tank.If need be, change the filter and allow time for bacteria to grow that will help reduce ammonia levels in the tank.Remove any dead plants to reduce ammonia accumulation. Reduce the stress in your fish's life by keeping him in his own tank, away from the other aggressive fish. You could also use a water heater and thermometer to keep his tank at the right temperature. Remove sharp objects from your fish's tank (e.g. gravel, sharp-edged decorations) to prevent further physical damage.

Do you feel excited and invigorated about getting out of the house? Do you feel anxious and a little exhausted with the idea? Tune in to your feelings and try to listen to them. If going out does not sound appealing, stay in., In some cases, alone time can increase productivity and boost mood. However, if you're spending time alone when you want to connect with others, being alone can have negative effects. You may end up feeling lonely, stressed, and unhappy.Think about whether you genuinely want to spend time alone.   Think about your interactions with people lately. Have you been craving human connection? Have interactions been sparse or negative? If you're craving interactions with others, spending time alone could make you unhappy. It may be best to go out and see others. However, if you've been spending a lot of time with people lately, you may benefit from a night alone. If you're not strongly craving companionship, going out may just stress you out more. In this case, you may want to stay in and do something on your own, like reading a book or watching a movie.  , If you've had a long week, you may be feeling tired. If you're already exhausted, you may not last long at an outing. If you're just going to end up turning in early, going out may not be worth it. However, if you're relatively energetic, you may enjoy spending an evening outside of your home.For example, if you've been working overtime you may not have the energy to get dressed and go out. If it's a been a normal week, however, it may not take too much motivation to throw on some clothes and head out the door.  , Going out can be a wonderful opportunity to make new friends. Meeting people is one of the major draws of leaving your apartment. Think about whether you're in the mood to mingle.Have you been stuck in a rut lately in regards to your social circle? If you've been craving new friends and new experiences, try going out and chatting with new people. However, you may not be looking to make new friends right now. You may also simply not be in a very social mood. If you're not feeling social, you're unlikely to interact with new people even if you want to. In this case, it may be best to stay in for the night.  , Going out requires getting dressed. Depending on the type of event, you may have to spend a lot of time getting ready. A formal event, for example, may require you to dress up. Think about what it will take to get ready and whether you feel like putting in that effort.You may be inclined to stay in if an event is very formal and you're not in the mood to dress up. If you don't feel like doing your hair and makeup and putting on your best clothes, stay in. However, if you're feeling in a dressy mood, you may relish the excuse to dress up. If an event is more casual, it may be easier to motivate yourself to throw on jeans and a t-shirt.

It makes no logical sense for anyone to assert that ""absolutely nothing"" could have produced that initiating bang or anything else: ""something existed"" and ""caused that"" -- producing those things that we know of as having a beginning.  , about:   There was a ""beginning of things"", There was an outline of ""from-simple-to-complex-development"" in the creation of earth and life in a Genesis account of creation. Explains our universe far ""in advance of humanity having theories/developed or technology"" to try to form such concepts and verify scientific assertions. For instance, the Bible says:   “He stretches out the north over 'empty' space, and 'hangs the earth on nothing'.” (Job 26:7)  How would the writer four thousand years in the past (2000BC) have known that the Earth is ""suspended on nothing"" -- not attached to anything, but mountains were called pillars of heaven in the poetry of Job 26:11, ""The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at His threatening."", ie: mountains ""tremble and are astonished"" (a poetic phrase).      , The Bible says that, “God is spirit…” (John 4:24), and it says that “God is love…” (1 John 4:8), and that ""perfect love casts out fear"". The awesome interdependence/relationships and amazing elegance pervading the entire universe suggest a planner, maker, superhuman architect having unlimited knowledge and power. The minds of human beings are taking time and, perhaps, eternity to discover what the originating mind (divine mind) actually accomplished in creating the universe and all it contains. The Bible says that God created mankind in his image (Genesis 1: 26-27), and it is logical to realize that the human mind is able to increasingly succeed, make progress, in understanding the universe because the human mind has a resemblance of the divine mind.  , Jesus was recorded to have been born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2) of the Tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:10), and to have visited the Temple (Malachi 3:1) and to have risen from the dead (Isaiah 53:11). Historical sources and archaeological evidence establish the legitimacy of Jesus of Nazareth as an actual person to an extent comparable to that of any other notable historical figure. The books called the gospels document the life and teachings of Jesus and the existence and expansion of Christianity as a major religion showing Christ's purpose to create free access to the all mighty through His advocacy/mediation.  , While the material universe provides us with the things necessary to sustain, enhance, and enjoy life, there are also exquisite luxuries which are not essential to survival and reproduction such as knowledge: art, music, and ever-evolving technologies. Is this indicative of an indifferent cosmos or more indicative of one which is somewhat friendly to self-teaching humans? It seems reasonable to conclude that the universe materialized due to the presence of an intelligent force/source when one takes the time to learn how so many things had to go right in order for us to be here and how difficult it would be to possibly explain how not one of those interdependent things went wrong without making reference to God pro or con (or beliefs). It also seems as though the universe were designed for people, considering how human beings are the phenomenal creatures with the rare capacity to ""be upwardly-mobile"" to maximize the somewhat hidden potential of creation.  , Accept it instead of doubting it, see it instead of shutting your eyes and you will believe that God exists. Consider how the usefulness and attractiveness of things produced by human beings are not accidental qualities when present but are a result of our intelligent nature and our natural delight in order, balance, and beauty. In a similar way, it is unreasonable to conclude that the surpassing usefulness and attractiveness of things throughout nature are accidental qualities but it is rather more reasonable to conclude that they are the result of the existence of a surpassing intelligence which also delights in order, balance, and beauty. Creativity is at the bedrock and pinnacle of the existence of all living and non-living things and it is up to each person to attempt to explain his or her natural reverence for this illustrious state of affairs. The Bible says that God created everything and was quite pleased with his work.

"[""tell others that you've decided to homeschool your child"", 'join a support group', 'listen to others', 'recognize the limitations of discussion', 'build a fact base about homeschooling', 'explain socialization strategies', 'share your story with others', 'emphasize the diversity inherent in homeschooling', 'involve kids in their learning', 'emphasize the opportunities available for homeschoolers', 'avoid arrogance']",How to Deal With Homeschool Misconceptions," While it is not your responsibility to educate others about homeschooling, you may be asked questions from well-meaning individuals, friends, and family members. Whether you are just beginning to homeschool your children or you have been homeschooling for years, you will likely find yourself having to explain your decision to others.   You may decide to homeschool your child based on personal preference, religious reasons, or if you find the public schools in your area to be unsatisfactory. It can be as easy to share your reason as, ""Yes, my family decided that we weren't happy with the quality of education that our kids were getting at the local elementary school so we've decided to homeschool them."" Understand that many people are curious about homeschooling because they are less familiar with homeschooling than they are with traditional public or private schooling. Everyone has different reasons to homeschool. Your decision to homeschool your children may be based on a very different set of circumstances or experiences than another parent’s decision.; , Look for homeschooling groups or support systems in your area to feel more connected with the homeschooling community and use them as a resource. Support groups are a helpful way to meet other parents who have gone through the homeschooling process before and who have useful advice for new homeschoolers.Other homeschooling parents can share ways that they've confronted misconceptions about homeschooling before, which can prepare you for whenever you may face them. Homeschooling groups are also valuable resources if you need advice on practical homeschooling matters, such as selecting a curriculum. Finding a homeschool support group in your area has been made easy by organizations like the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), a homeschool advocacy group, which has sites that allow you to search for groups in your zip code., While you do not need to justify your decision to homeschool to others, you should listen to the opinions of others when you engage in conversations with them.   When you share your decision with people that you care about, be open to hearing the opinions of others. While their opinions may not change your decision, their support can be invaluable to your homeschooling experience. If you receive unwanted or unsolicited advice from others about your decision to homeschool, feel free to steer the conversation away from homeschooling or end the conversation.  , There is a time and place for explanation. If you run into a hostile individual who is rude or refuses to listen to your reasoning, you must know when to walk away from a situation.   There may be individuals who feel strongly against your decision to homeschool and they will have their reasons for reaching that conclusion. If they cannot be respectful of your decision, you do not have to engage with them on the subject of homeschooling anymore. Use reason and rationality to explain your decision, even when you're confronted with an emotional response. A simple answer like, ""This is the best decision for my family and if you cannot respect that, I don't think it's helpful for either of us to speak about this again.""  , Many misconceptions about homeschooling come from a lack of information or knowledge about what homeschooling entails. While you are most likely familiar with the benefits of homeschooling, it is often useful to have a wide pool of facts to draw upon when you confront misconceptions.   Education research can provide you with facts and statistics that can help you to better explain your decision. The National Home Education Research Institute, HSLDA, and the Coalition for Responsible Home Education are all great sources for research on homeschooling.  , Many people worry that homeschooled children do not have the same opportunities to socialize as traditionally schooled children. People may ask, ""What do your children do to make friends?"" You can share the ways that you've involved them in groups and you can say that, ""Our children see their friends as frequently as they would if they were in a public school.""   There are many ways that children have the opportunity to spend time with other children. You can enroll your child in an organized sports league, join homeschooling groups that take field trips, participate in religious organizations, and being active in your community. Homeschooling does not mean that you want to deprive your child of socialization opportunities, but it can protect them from some of the more negative social aspects of the public school system, like bullying.  , If someone is curious about your decision to homeschool, feel free to share your reasons for coming to the decision to begin homeschooling with them.   Don’t feel obligated to share reasons if they are personal. Of course, the reasons that factored into your decision to homeschool may be intimate and private. You are under no obligation to share more information than you are willing to share.  , There are more than 2 million children being homeschooled in the United States in 2016 and they are from every social, economic, and ethnic background.Emphasize that there is no single type of homeschooling family. Many people have an idea of what type of family decides to homeschool their children, but this isn't an accurate depiction of who will homeschool their children. Just like there is diversity in the type of homeschoolers, there are very different ways that you can choose to homeschool your child. Every family makes an individual decision about how they want to school their children. There are many different types of homeschool services to choose from, like online programs, college preparation curriculums, and families that homeschool their children in groups., If you have older children, they can be involved in your homeschooling decisions. As kids get older, their views on education and how they want to learn may change. If they no longer want to be homeschooled and can offer viable reasons why this is the case, consider transitioning to public schooling.   Bring your children to the library and have them pick out books that they’re interested in, and involve them in small parts of your curriculum development. . Have your children share what they’re interested in and use that as an opportunity to engage their interests. For example, if your child becomes interested in animals and their health, go to the zoo or have a conversation with a friend who works in the animal care field. Let your child explore their interests, within reason.  , Families that decide to homeschool their children are able to choose from a variety of homeschooling services and curriculums.   In many school districts, homeschooled children are welcome to join sports team and participate in extracurricular activities at the schools. Homeschooled students are more likely to get into college and to graduate and they test more highly than public school students in standardized exams., Your decision to homeschool your children is your decision, just as it is other parent's decision to enroll their children in a public or private school. Each of your decisions is your own.   Your decision to homeschool your child does not make you superior or a better parent than others who chose not to homeschool their children. Homeschooling is not a feasible option for many people, including those who would otherwise want to homeschool their children. Being cognizant of other's struggles will help you to remain respectful of their decisions. Return respect with respect. When other people respect your decision to homeschool, you should respect their decisions as well.

"['leave the television or radio on', 'provide your cockatiel with a variety of toys', 'move your cockatiel’s cage to a different location', 'provide your cockatiel with a cage mate']",How to Have Fun With Your New Cockatiel2," Environmental enrichment is very important to your cockatiel’s health and well-being. The happier he feels in his environment, the more fun you will have with him. For the times when you are away from home, leaving the television or radio on for him will keep him mentally and visually stimulated until you get home.Channels that your bird might enjoy are the Travel Channel and Discovery Channel.Animal Planet is another good channel for your bird to watch. Other than the television or radio, you could also play a CD with bird or nature sounds., As with other pets, cockatiels can become bored when playing with the same toys. Giving your cockatiel a variety of toys (e.g., wooden toys, puzzler toys) will provide him with good physical and mental exercise. You do not have to spend a fortune on toys, though—rotating out the toys every few days will give him what seems like an endless array of toys from which to choose.Cockatiels especially like toys they can shred and destroy. A balled-up piece of newspaper or notebook paper is perfect for your cockatiel and will save you money.Cockatiels have a natural instinct to chew.Select chew toys made of either wood or leather.Chew toys have the added benefit of keeping your cockatiel’s beak trimmed down.Foraging toys encourage your cockatiel to exhibit his natural foraging behavior. By requiring him to put in extra effort to get his food, foraging toys also provide good mental stimulation and physical exercise.Rope preening toys are also available that will satisfy your cockatiel’s natural urge to preen and prevent him from feather picking and self-mutilation.Comfort toys (e.g., snuggle perches) are toys that your cockatiel could snuggle up against, especially if he does not have a cage mate.Exercise toys, such as swings and bungees, will provide your cockatiel with plenty of physical exercise., This will give your cockatiel a change of scenery, which would keep him visually stimulated. Select a new location that is on the periphery of activity, rather than in the center of it. This would give your bird a chance to observe the different activity, but also have some peace and quiet.Determine if your bird will be able to tolerate a change of scenery. If your bird is older or timid, a change in location could cause him to start feather picking., Since cockatiels are such social animals, your cockatiel may be happier if he has a cage mate with whom he can interact.If you spend a lot of time away from home, providing your cockatiel with a cage mate will keep him entertained and busy while you are not home.   Make sure that the new bird is well socialized and friendly.Be mindful that you will need to have frequent interaction with both birds.Having two birds in the same cage could have its downsides. For example, the birds could start to exhibit aggressive behavior. Also, when the birds reach reproductive maturity, they may begin to start feather picking because of hormonal stress.If your bird is older and has become accustomed to the solitary life, giving him a cage mate may not be ideal.Consult with your avian veterinarian if you are considering getting a cage mate for your cockatiel.

"['find a suitable book to read to them', 'translate the story into sign language', 'keep the book visible for the person to see', 'elaborate and explain some texts', 'adjust your signing placement to fit the story', 'if necessary', 'change your reading style', 'use attention maintenance strategies', 'use eye gaze and eye contact while you read', 'act out the story', 'enjoy the power of storytelling']",How to Read to the Deaf," There are near millions of books out there in the world and can be found in many libraries, bookstores, and even online. Choose a book that is age-appropriate for your listener and a book you know they'll enjoy from their passions, interests, hobbies, or favorite type of story such as fairy tales, action plots, romantic stories, horror books, etc.   Avoid books that wouldn't be suitable for them. For example, reading a kid-themed fairy tale to an adult probably wouldn't be a good idea. Reading a complicated algebra book wouldn't be a smart choice for a five year old child. ; , Read the story aloud and then translate the story into sign language using your hands. Make sure that the listener can see you clearly and that your hands are visible in sight. If the book has images or illustrations, lift the book so they're able to see them. Use one hand for signing and the other book for holding onto the book. If you need both hands to sign, consider placing the book against any object so the book can hold itself. Another method is having the listener can hold the book and being next to them to read and sign. It's unnecessary to mouth the words of the story. Most deaf and hard of hearing adults and teenagers can read lips and follow along as you sign. For a child who has a hearing impairment, mouthing the words will prevent them for learning how to read lips from other people. Avoid wearing any excessive jewelry on your hands or arms while you sign as this can be distracting and bothersome to the person when they try to enjoy the story. Keep a consistent pace while you read. Don't try to rush through reading or signing. The more important thing is to sign each letter at a consistent rhythm, but not bouncing it, so that the person can easily distinguish a pause. It's better to go slow and steady than to rush and suddenly pause when you can't remember a sign - the reader may misinterpret this as the beginning of a new word. , Ensure that the book is easy to see so the listener can see the written words, images, illustrations, diagrams, graphs, bullet points, and/or other added information into the book. It may help to have a pointer tool to show important information clearly. This can be useful if you're reading to a class or a group of hearing impaired people, or if you're trying to present information to them. , Just like a hearing person, there will be some parts of a story the person may not understand clearly. Whenever a new action takes place in the story, pause for a minute and try to summarize what's going on in your own words by using sign language. To help know their understanding of the story so far, you can ask questions such as ""What do you think of character so far? She seems to be pretty lonely, huh?"" You can also have them predict what will happen next in the story by asking and providing reasonable guesses (e.g ""What do you think will happen next? Do you think she'll find her dog?""). This can ensure that they understand the story well. If you're teaching a classroom or trying to share information, you may want to stop several times to give others a chance to state questions or ask for any clarification, especially if the information is complicating to understand for some. If there's any hidden meanings or jokes in the story, be sure to explain them. Puns, humor, and jokes can be hard to catch when you're translating a story in sign language, so if the listener doesn't seem to have picked up on it, explain it. , During points of the story, you may want to change your signing placement and sign on the pages or sign on different objects. This can make the story more fitting and can help with certain plots or rising actions in the story.  , To match with the story, adjust your signing style be being dramatic and exaggerating certain signs and facial expressions. This is usually best for a younger audience, but it can be done when reading action stories or sharing dramatic plots.  , For younger people such as teenagers or children, attention is bound to be lost at times and there will be times the listener won't pay attention as you read to them. You can kindly get back their attention by tapping on their shoulder gently or giving them a light nudge.   It may also help to create a 'secret code' to help get your listener's attention. This can be useful in a large group of people such as a classroom. For example, you might place a toy light on or clap your hands to remind the person to focus on the information you are giving them.  , When reading the story, look at the person every now and then to encourage elicit participation. If there are multiple people listening to the story, shift your gaze every few seconds. Break eye contact briefly every 5-15 seconds. Too much eye-contact can be as off-putting as none at all. You may want to look at the book every now and then to avoid over-using eye contact , While you read, you can make the story even more engaging by acting the story. For example, if a fox is running around quickly in a story, you might want to gallop around the room while you read that part. This not only makes it entertaining for an younger audience, but also a whole lot fun for everyone to enjoy. , Reading is meant to be a fun, educational way to share the power of words into a creative story. Be clear while you read, but also fun and entertaining to get the listener's attention. Not only will they enjoy but you might, too!

In addition, you'll need money to close the sale and run the hotel until it begins returning profits to you. How much you'll need for each of these expenses will depend on the value of the property and your business model. Start by compiling money from your savings and investment accounts. Don't worry if you don't have a lot of money saved in those accounts; there are plenty of other sources of financing you can use.You can also take out a home equity line of credit (HELOC), take out a second mortgage, use a personal credit card, or ask for loans from friends and family to get more startup money.For example, imagine that you have saved up $47,500 in various accounts. In addition, you are able to take out a second mortgage for $100,000. Finally, you secure a $20,000 loan from a friend. This would give you $167,500 total to invest in your hotel.; , You may also be able to get investment money out of your retirement account. However, this will incur penalties depending on your age and the type of account. For example, any money you take out of an IRA will be taxed as income (at your regular income tax rate) and, if you are under 59.5 years of age, will also suffer a 10 percent penalty.You should also take into consideration that if your hotel fails, you will have little or no money left in your retirement account to use later in life.   Imagine that you are 35 years and decide to take some money out an IRA to add to your hotel investment amount. You decide to take out $50,000. This withdrawal would be penalized for 10 percent of its value, or $5,000, and taxed at your income tax rate. Assuming an income tax rate of 25 percent, you would be left with $32,500 ($50,000*(1-(0.10 + 0.25)))after the penalty and taxes. This would give you a total investable amount of $200,000 ($167,500 from earlier plus the $32,500 from the IRA).  , You will be able to increase your investment amount if you can find other partners to go in with you. Ask friends and family if they are willing to make a more sizable investment in your business in exchange for equity (a share of the business's ownership and profits). You may also be able to find partners in local investment clubs or online.  , A good rule of thumb is to set aside 25 percent of your investment money to pay for other costs. These costs include closing costs with the seller, legal costs (for the purchase contract), and working capital used to begin running the hotel. Subtract this money from your investment amount and use the remainder to make a down payment.For the previous example, this means that you would set aside $50,000 (0.25*$200,000). This leaves you with $150,000 for a down payment.  , Your price range will depend on how much a down payment the seller of the property requires. At this point, you'll likely be unsure of how much this will be. Set several different price ranges that are dependent on the seller requiring different down payment percentages, from 5 percent to 20 percent. For example, using the above example of $150,000 available for a down payment, you could afford:   A 5 percent down payment for a hotel costing $3 million. A 10 percent down payment for a hotel costing $1.5 million. A 20 percent down payment for a hotel costing $750,000. 20 percent down payments are the norm if you use a bank loan to purchase your hotel. However, with seller financing (borrowing from the seller of the property), you may be able to get the down payment percentage down to 5 percent., You need to make sure that any hotel you want to buy will be able to provide you with enough returns to cover both your expenses and your cost of borrowing. To do this, project the cost of your loan payments over the next three to five years. This may require the assistance of your loan broker. Then, project the cost of the hotel's expenses, like costs of operating, property taxes, insurance, and utilities. Compare the sum of these expenses and your loan costs to the hotel's projected earnings over the same three to five year period. Make sure that these earnings cover or exceed your costs.Hotel expense and cost information can be estimated from examining hotel similar to those in your price range.  , In looking for hotels to purchase, you have the option of either buying existing hotel properties or looking for another property to convert into a hotel (or bed and breakfast). In the latter case, you will need to set aside more money for renovations, but are free to choose a larger variety of properties. Make this decision before moving forward with the property selection process.  , You'll be spending a lot of time at your hotel, so make sure it is close by to where you live or easy to get to. You may even have to move there full time to make sure the hotel is run properly. In addition, having a familiarity with the local area and hotel market can be a serious advantage., Once you've chosen an area, try to get a sense of the hotel market in that area. Ask local real estate brokers about hotel sales in the area, specifically if they generally sell for less or more than the asking price. Lower prices may reflect a depressed market and allow you to come in at a lower price and possibly work out seller financing with the seller. However, unless you're expecting an economic turnaround, this also means that cash flows from the hotel will also be low.You can also look at the national state of the hotel industry by searching for relevant news articles online.  , Let real estate brokers in your chosen area know that you are seeking to purchase a hotel and what your price range is. They will be able to show you properties currently on the market or let you know if new ones become for sale. They also may be able to show you properties that can be converted into a hotel.   It may also be advantageous to drive around the local area and look for properties, particularly if you are planning to significantly update or restore your hotel. If you find one, you can access real estate records at the county seat to find out who owns the property and go from there., After searching for properties, you may start to receive offers to sell through your real estate broker or from a property owner you've contacted. These offers will include information about the hotel's amenities, financial performance, market information, competition, and information about seller financing. If the offer is missing any of these items contact the seller and request them.Once you have an offer to sell, check that the hotel meets your requirements in price, location, repairs or renovations needed, and style. If it doesn't, call the seller and tell them you aren't interested.If you have several offers, make a table comparing the benefits and drawbacks of each one, for example in cost, renovations needed, and amenities.  , Locate and acquire the services of an appraiser who has experience with hotels or similar properties. It's best to use one who also has experience in the area where your hotel is located.Work with the appraiser to determine whether or not the hotel is actually worth the asking price. If it isn't, let them identify areas where you could point out problems or damage that you can use to urge the seller to back down on their price.  , A qualified accountant can help you examine the hotel's financial records. This gives you reputable information on the hotel's cash flows, assets, and other financial positions. More importantly, the accountant will be able to assess whether or not any of this information was mishandled or misreported, and may be able to give you a more accurate picture of the hotel's current financial health., A market or financial consultant can be useful when projecting future earnings from the hotel. They will be able to combine an analysis of local markets, the hotel market overall, and other trends to identify your hotel's growth and earnings potential over a number of years. They will also be able to help you identify marketing goals, find ways to increase profits, and assist in writing a business plan., These two professionals will examine the building to make sure it complies with local building codes and is structurally sound. In addition, the engineer will determine the condition of utilities, machines, plumbing, and electric work in the hotel. This will help you locate any areas that are in immediate need of renovation or repair. It may also help you figure out how you will renovate an existing structure to meet your hotel's needs and get an estimate on how much those renovations would cost., The only surefire way to make sure that your hotel business meets all local, state, and federal regulations is to hire an experience real estate or hotel attorney. The lawyer will examine everything from environmental and zoning regulations to taxes and trademarks, making sure that your business doesn't face any sort of legal liability down the road. The same lawyer can also help you out later in making sure that your purchase of the property goes through as planned and that the purchase contract is written in accordance with the law., Subtract your down payment from the asking price of the property. The down payment percentage will vary based on whether or not you secure seller financing for the property or use a bank loan. Next, you'll have to adjust your offer based on the hotel market. If the market is not very active (and you don't have much competition for the property), you may be able to subtract another 10 or 20 percent from the price in your initial offer.However, in a busier market, come in at the asking price (minus your down payment) or above the asking price if you want to make sure you get the property.  , Once you've determined a fair price for the property, write the seller or work through your real estate broker to submit your offer. Make sure to include proposals for seller financing if the seller offered it in the original offer to sell. Your offer will also specify the amount of your down payment. Your offer should be a short letter that clearly sets forth your terms.   Include in your offer that you require a set amount of time to inspect the property (for damages or necessary repairs), that you need to look through the hotel's books (to confirm their financial information), and that your offer relies on the two of you reaching a purchase agreement and signing a purchase contract., Chances are, the seller will respond to your offer with a counteroffer. Negotiate with the seller and try to stick as close to your original offer as possible. You may also be able to negotiate benefits like having the seller pay for certain improvements, repairs, or renovations. In addition, be sure to work out details like keeping key suppliers and employees, as well as how long, if at all, the seller will work with you to transition the hotel's management. This negotiation process may be long, but in the end it will be worth it if you and the seller can work out a mutually beneficial deal.Make sure you get any promises for additional payments or aid from the seller in writing and that they are later included in the purchase contract.  , The seller will likely write the purchase agreement, but you should hire a real estate attorney to review the agreement for you. A lawyer will ensure that the agreement is in your best interest and complies with your agreed-upon terms. Make sure you use an experienced, local lawyer who specializes in real estate law.   In addition to reviewing the document, your lawyer can lengthen the approval process, giving you more time to secure your financing or seek out additional financing if you need it.Make sure the agreement stipulates that you can get out of the purchase up until the closing date without penalty., You will have some time after your purchase agreement is agreed upon but before your closing date. Use this time to work with the seller to learn the hotel's business model and make tweaks to your own business strategy. Check and double check your expected revenues and expenses during this period so that you won't have any surprises when you take control of the hotel.","['purchase agreement', 'appraiser', 'several options', 'seller', 'hotel', 'accountant', 'books', 'regulatory guidelines', 'costs', 'real estate brokers', 'price range', 'partners', 'lawyer', 'general area', 'engineer', 'retirement account', 'money', 'much money', 'advantage', 'fair price', 'offer', 'project future earnings', 'time', 'property', 'architect', 'financial consultant', 'market']"

While not every illness causes elevated fever, it can help narrow down why the nausea is happening. Was it something you ate that turned bad? Food poisoning is surprisingly common. Check with other members of your household--if all of your roommates have stomachaches after eating dinner last night, it may be due to food poisoning. If you keep having issues more than a couple of days, it is possible that you may have a gastro-intestinal issue that goes beyond a ""stomach bug"". There are a lot of medical reasons nausea happens, from simple to severe. A trip to your general practitioner may be in order. Severe and prolonged nausea may even be a reason to go to the ER (as discussed more in-depth below.)  , If you have frequent bouts of nausea, keep a journal for a couple weeks to see if you can find a pattern that points to the culprit. If you suspect food intolerance or other reactions, avoid or limit the food and talk to your doctor. /images/thumb/9/97/Cure-Nausea-Step-17-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-17-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/9/97/Cure-Nausea-Step-17-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Cure-Nausea-Step-17-Version-6.jpg          Lactose intolerance is a common cause of nausea. The ability to digest milk comfortably as an adult is mostly limited to people of European descent, and even then many are lactose-intolerant. Use over-the-counter medications like Lactaid or Dairy Ease to help you digest dairy items, or stick with milk products in which are processed by enzymes, such as yogurt and cheese. Food sensitivities or even allergies can be another issue. If you notice that you feel queasy shortly after eating strawberries or foods with strawberry, this may be an indicator of this problem. Food sensitivity and intolerance can only be definitively diagnosed by a qualified medical specialist. It has become trendy in some regions for people to self-identify as ""gluten intolerant"" and the like without any sort of medical testing. Be careful of such fads. There are some people who react horribly to gluten. But sometimes the ""cure"" is due to a placebo effect or simply a person feeling better after a period of time, and ascribing the ""cure"" to the diet change when in fact it is unclear that it was the diet change, or the fact the body simply healed.  , Before introducing more drugs into your system to treat the nausea, you should first make sure that the source itself isn’t one of the medications you’re already on. Many drugs, like codeine or hydrocodone, can cause nausea and vomiting.If you suffer from ongoing nausea, talk to your doctor about whether any of your medications list it as a side effect. He or she may be able to suggest an alternate medication or a lower dosage. /images/thumb/9/90/Cure-Nausea-Step-18-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-18-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/9/90/Cure-Nausea-Step-18-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Cure-Nausea-Step-18-Version-6.jpg         , It can also be caused by things such as riding on carnival rides. This can be prevented by choosing the seat that will typically have the least motion — the front seat of a car or the window seat of a plane. /images/thumb/4/49/Cure-Nausea-Step-19-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-19-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/4/49/Cure-Nausea-Step-19-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Cure-Nausea-Step-19-Version-6.jpg          Try fresh air, whether by rolling down a window, or taking a walk outside for a few minutes. Avoid smoking. Void spicy or greasy foods. Try to keep your head as still as possible to manage motion sickness. Antihistamines such as Dramamine or Antivert are great over-the-counter medications that can effectively treat motion sickness, as well. These should be taken about 30 minutes to one hour before travel, but can cause drowsiness. Scopolamine is a medication available by prescription for severe cases. Some people get relief from ginger and ginger products. Ginger ale (with natural flavoring), ginger root, or ginger candy can all be helpful. Avoid traveling on a very full or empty stomach.  , Though commonly called “morning sickness,” the nausea that comes with the early (and sometimes later) stages of pregnancy and can come at any time in the day. In most cases, the nausea passes after the first trimester, so stay strong and wait it out! However, if it is severe, frequent, or increasing, see your doctor./images/thumb/d/dd/Cure-Nausea-Step-20-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-20-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/d/dd/Cure-Nausea-Step-20-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Cure-Nausea-Step-20-Version-6.jpg          Eating crackers, especially plain saltines, will help you feel better, but avoid large meals. Instead, snack every 1-2 hours. Ginger products such as ginger tea have been proven to help with morning sickness nausea as well., If you had too much to drink the night before, you need to regain fluids before your body can start to feel better. There are also products available over the counter — like Alka-Seltzer Morning Relief — that are formulated to speed up the recovery process from a hangover. /images/thumb/7/76/Cure-Nausea-Step-21-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-21-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/7/76/Cure-Nausea-Step-21-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Cure-Nausea-Step-21-Version-6.jpg         , Vomiting and diarrhea can dehydrate the body, so make sure to replenish yourself with plenty of water and sports drinks. If you’re having trouble keeping liquids down, try taking frequent, small sips rather than chugging a drink. /images/thumb/2/23/Cure-Nausea-Step-22-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-22-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/2/23/Cure-Nausea-Step-22-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Cure-Nausea-Step-22-Version-6.jpg          Signs of dehydration include dark urine, dizziness and dry mouth. Seek medical help if you cannot keep down liquids.  , In cases of heat exhaustion and other situations in which a person can get dehydrated, ironically one of the symptoms may be nausea. /images/thumb/7/7f/Cure-Nausea-Step-23-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Cure-Nausea-Step-23-Version-6.jpg /images/thumb/7/7f/Cure-Nausea-Step-23-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Cure-Nausea-Step-23-Version-6.jpg          Do not drink water quickly. Take a few sips at a time, or suck on ice chips so you do not trigger a throwing up response and make things worse. Liquids should ideally not be ice-cold; cool or lukewarm is best. Especially if you are overheated, drinking very cold liquids can cause the stomach to cramp up and throw up.  , There are many serious conditions which can also cause nausea including hepatitis, ketoacidosis, serious head injuries, food poisoning, pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, appendicitis or others.

You'll also need to prepare your baking sheets. Lightly grease at least two baking sheets so the cookies don't stick.   You could also line the baking sheets with a silicone mat or parchment paper to keep the cookies from sticking.; , Place 1         It's important to beat the butter and sugars till they're light and fluffy. This will help your cookies rise and give them volume.  , Stop the mixer and add one egg to the creamed butter and sugars. You can also add any flavor extract at this time (1 teaspoon). Turn the mixture back on to medium speed and beat it until the egg is combined.         The egg will help the cookie dough bind together and adds moisture.  , Take 3 or 4 ripe persimmons and cut the tops off of them using a sharp knife. Use a spoon to scoop out the persimmon pulp and place the pulp in a food processor. Blend the pulp until it's completely smooth and pureed.Always use caution when using knives and food processor blades.  , Measure out 1 cup of the pureed persimmon pulp from your food processor. Add the pulp to the bowl with the wet ingredients. Stir or beat the persimmon pulp into the wet ingredients until they're completely combined.You can save any excess persimmon puree for use in another recipe.  , Place a sifter over a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add your dry ingredients and sift them into the bowl. This will break up any lumps in the dry ingredients and help them mix with the wet ingredients more evenly. You'll need:2 cups (240 g) of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon of ginger 1/8 teaspoon of allspice  , Turn your mixer on to low and gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Turn off the mixer as soon as the dry ingredients are incorporated. If you mix the dough too long, your cookies will be hard and tough.Avoid mixing the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients on a medium or high speed. Mixing on low ensures that you don't over mix the dough and it keeps the dry ingredients from being beaten out of the bowl.  , Add 1/3 cups (30 g) of old-fashioned oats, 1/2 cups (60 g) of dried cranberries, 1/4 cups (45 g) of white chocolate chips, and 1/4 cups (30 g) of roughly chopped almonds. Stir the dough until they're just combined.   Try to ensure that these ingredients are evenly mixed throughout the dough so that each cookie ends up with a little of everything.  , Use a cookie scoop, ice cream scoop or spoon to scoop about 12 cookies onto each baking sheet. Each ball of cookie dough should be about 2 to 3 tablespoons in size. Bake the cookies for 14 to 16 minutes or until they're golden brown and almost firm to the touch. Remove them to a rack to cool.         The cookies should be at least 2 inches apart on your baking sheet.  , Instead of roughly chopped almonds, you could use your favorite baking nut. Just try to keep the amount (1/4 of a cup) the same. You could use chopped:  Pecans Walnuts Hazelnuts  , If you don't like the tart flavor of the dried cranberries, you could make this recipe with dried raisins or golden raisins (sultanas) instead. These can make your cookies taste sweeter as well.  You could also experiment with dried fruits like apricots, cherries, or currants.  , White chocolate has a mellow sweetness, but if you want a richer chocolate flavor, try substituting the white chocolate chips with milk or semisweet chocolate chips.  Be aware that a bittersweet chocolate can overwhelm the flavor of the persimmon, so only swap the chocolates if you want less of a persimmon flavor.  , To add depth of flavor to your cookies, you could add 1 teaspoon of a flavor extract when you add the egg to the butter and sugars. Try using vanilla or almond extract.  Don't expect a lot of flavor by adding the extract. It will enhance the flavor of the cookies instead of overwhelming the flavor.

Combine all exceptional outfits to come up with new looks.   Match existing casual outfits and mix with jackets, enabling these to be worn to work as well as to an event.       Jeans and a t-shirt are sufficient for errands and housework. Jeans with heels or elegant shoes suddenly look more up-market.       Create three different outfits for evening wear using existing clothes. Challenge yourself to doing this.      ; , Improve how they look by adding embellishments, making them fit better or removing sleeves or legs from them.

"['learn the major scale to greatly increase your note range when playing', 'master the minor scale for a slightly more moody set of notes', 'learn how the major and minor scales are combined to play even further down the neck', 'play the other notes of chords instead of just the roots', 'use accenting techniques to make each note stand out', 'prioritize the 5th note of each scale when making transitions', 'mute unneeded strings with your other fingers as you play', 'study music theory']",How to Play the Bass Guitar3," You must, at a minimum, learn the major and minor scales. These two scales, played across the guitar, can guide you throw 90% of the songs thrown your way. If a song is in the key of C-major, you have the entire C-major scale at your disposal. The following scale is for A-major, but you simply start it on whatever note you want to put it in the key of this note. Bolded notes are the roots, or the two A notes.   G|-----5----6---7---| D|-----5----6---7---| A|--4--5--------7---| E|------5--------7---|, The minor scale generally has a ""darker"" or more ""moody tone to it. The A-minor scale located below is a good fit for songs in A-minor. Again, bolded notes indicate root notes.   G|--4--5-------7------| D|------5-------7------| A|------5-------7--8--| E|------5-------7--8--|, This handy trick will double the number of notes at your disposal when playing songs, though it is important to note that they still have different feels. To find the notes, take the major scale in the key you're playing, for example, the A major shown above. If you start a minor scale on the second note of the major scale, in this case the 7th fret B, all of these notes will fit in your song as well!   Otherwise put, a song in A-major can use either the A-major scale or the B-minor scale. This relationship holds up and down the fretboard.  , For example, you could play just A, E, and D if the chords are A7, E7, and D7. But you could also play some of those 7th notes, which simply mean the 7th note in the associated scale. So, if the guitarist is playing an A7, you can also hit the 7th not in the A-major scale (2nd string, 6th fret) to sound amazing.   If you're struggling with the numbers, just ask the guitarist to show you the chord. All the notes he's playing on his top four strings will match the notes on your four strings., Many bassists can play 10 notes and sound good, but only the best players can play one note and make it sound amazing. Bass is a very physical instrument, and your ability to handle and manipulate the strings is how you wring emotion and power out of every note:    Vibrato: Keeping your finger on the string, shake your hand up and down. You should hear the note ""waving"" based on how high or far you shake the string.  Bends: With your finger on the fret, use 2-3 fingers to push the string up the neck. You should hear the note's pitch change as you bend the string. You can also pull the string downward, too.  Slides: Play a note and, without taking your hand off the string, slide down to the next note you want to play, fluidly transitioning down.  Hammer-Ons: Instead of plucking a note, slam your finger down on the string at the fret you want, sounding it out with just this hand.  Pull-Offs: When removing your finger from a fret, use your fretting hand to pluck the string instead of coming straight off., If you stick to root notes, their octaves, and the 5th, you can create many interesting, melodic, and moving basslines. The 5th is simply the 5th note in the scale -- even if that particular chord isn't being used. You can slide the 5th note between other roots to effortlessly slid up and down the neck. Check the lick below, played over a simple C, G, D chord progression illustrated below.   G|------------5---------------------------------------------------------------| D|---------5-----5--------------------------5--------------------------------| A|----3--------------0--3--0---2-------5-----5-----------------------------| E|---------------------------------------------------3----------3/10----10--| |-C-Major-|-----------------|-G-Major-|--------------------|-D-Major-|  , The bass is a very low, deep frequency, and you'll notice that it shakes the room when played loud. This is great, except when that shaking sounds out the strings you aren't even playing! To avoid this, bass players must use their whole hand to keep other strings mute, which you can do by simply laying a finger on the string to keep it still:   When you play a note, let your finger come up, resting on the string above it to mute it. Don't pull your hand away from the guitar after plucking. Do the same thing when plucking your thumb downward, resting it on the string below. Use your ring and pinky fingers to mute lower strings, resting them on all strings below the two plucking fingers. Use your thumb to mute higher strings, resting it on strings above the ones you're playing., There are endless options available to you, from new scales to modes and melodic tricks, that only come from time spent learning music theory. Start with the basics, like the circle of fifths, before moving on to scale composition and more fun tricks and tips.

"['smile often', 'project an open posture', 'make frequent eye contact', 'don’t fidget', 'mirror the other person’s movements']",How to Look Approachable1," A warm, inviting smile can put anyone at ease and makes you look like you're having a great time. People will notice your smile and think are friendly, pleasant, and open to having a conversation.Studies have shown that smiling also helps reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and your heart rate, which will put you at ease in social situations, too!, When people are uncomfortable in a situation, they have a tendency to physically close off from those around them. Be mindful of your posture. If you are feeling nervous or are in a bad mood, remind yourself to strand straight, keep your arms at your sides, and lean toward people when they are speaking to you. Reminding yourself to maintain these postures will help improve your mood and will help draw people toward you.Show that you are interested in what others are saying by angling toward them when they are speaking. Adjust your feet, legs, and your body to face the speaker. This shows the speaker that you are actively listening and involved in their story.Don’t fold your arms when you are in social situations. You may be projecting negative cues such as ""I'm too busy"" or ""Leave me alone"" when your arms are in this closed posture. Other people will watch your body for cues, so it's important pay attention to what cues you're displaying.  , In social situations, people will look around the room and will likely begin a conversation with someone if they make eye contact with them. Don’t stare at the floor or at your feet. Look up and be aware of your surroundings to attract the attention of others.   When someone approaches, smile and maintain eye contact throughout the conversation. In a one-on-one conversation, maintain eye contact for periods of 7 to 10 seconds. While in a group conversation, maintain eye contact for periods of 3 to 5 seconds.This simple look will demonstrate that you are trustworthy and interested in the topic., It's okay to feel nervous, bored, or unhappy, but if you want appear approachable, take care not to project negative emotions. Shuffling back and forth, biting your nails, twirling your hair, and other forms of fidgeting can display signs of boredom, stress, or nervousness.Be aware of these habits, and take a few deep breaths when you feel the urge to fidget.   Avoid touching your hand to your face frequently. This can signal that you are feeling anxious.Tapping your feet can signal impatience or boredom. People may feel like you aren't interested in the conversation., When chatting with someone at a party or an event, pay attention to their gestures, posture, and stance and try to emulate them. If that person has an open stance, adopt one as well. If they use lively hand gestures while telling a story, try to do the same. Mirroring a person’s body language can help build trust and establish a connection when used sparingly.  When used appropriately, it can help create a positive rapport and signal to the other person that you like their company.  Think about your relationship with the person before you mirror their body language. Avoid mirroring someone who is your superior. If you mirror your boss’s body language during a meeting, for example, they may see this as impolite and forceful.","['person', 'movements', 'frequent eye contact', 'open posture']"

If you do not have a lot of time on your hands, you can use a pre-baked sheet cake instead. Click here to learn how to assemble the cake, here to learn how to prepare the icing, and here to learn how to decorate the petit fours.  A half-sheet cake pan is 12 by 16 by 3 inches (30.48 by 40.64 by 7.62 centimeters).; , Pour the flour into a mixing bowl, then add the baking powder and salt. Stir together until evenly combined, then set aside., Pour the sugar into a large mixing bowl, then add the butter and shortening. Beat together until smooth, using an electric mixer or hand-held beater., Keep mixing with your electric mixer until everything is smooth and fluffy., Add half of the flour mixture into the sugar mixture, and beat well until combined. Stir in half of the evaporated milk. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture and evaporated milk., Gently fold the sour cream into the batter using a rubber spatula. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl., Check the cake for doneness after 25 minutes be poking a toothpick into the center. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is ready. If the toothpick has crumbs on it, bake the cake for 5 to 10 more minutes., Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes first, then carefully flip it over onto another sheet of parchment paper. Peel away the parchment paper from the bottom (if necessary), and discard it.  , You can do this using a cake splitting tool, a long knife, or a piece of thread.  If you are using a pre-baked sheet cake, check the thickness; you may have to split it into thirds instead. If you are using a pre-baked pound cake, cut it into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) thick slices.  , Keep the top half of the cake on the cardboard, and set it aside for now. If you don't have any thin cardboard on hand, you can also use a thin cutting matt instead., You can also use a different type of jam, such as strawberry or blueberry. You could also use lemon curd. Try to use something tart or sour tasting; this will help balance out the overall sweetness.  If you split your pre-baked sheet cake into thirds, repeat this step for the middle layer. If you are using a pound cake cut into thin slices, coat only half of the slices; reserve the other half for the top.  , You don't absolutely have to do this, but there is nothing wrong with extra frosty goodness. Make sure that the frosting goes from edge to edge, corner to corner.  Do not use your icing for this step; use buttercream frosting instead. Cream cheese buttercream or vanilla buttercream work especially well. You can use homemade buttercream or you can use store-bought buttercream. If you split your pre-baked sheet cake into thirds, repeat this step for the middle layer.  , Hold the top layer over the bottom one, and line up one of the edges. Carefully slide the thin sheet of cardboard out from under the top layer, letting the cake fall into place. Use your hands to nudge the top layer into place, if necessary.  If you are using a pound cake, start playing the bare slices on top of the jam-and-frosting covered ones.  , Use an offset cake decorating spatula to spread a thin layer of frosting on the top layer of your cake. This will give you a smoother finish when you go to pour the icing on top. Do not cover the sides of the cake., Use a sharp knife to cut the edges off of your cake so that the corners are nice and sharp. Don't cut the cake into squares yet, however! Instead, use the parchment paper to lift the cake onto a baking sheet. Then, move the cake into your freezer. This will allow the cake to set up while you prepare the icing. , Fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water, then place a heat-safe glass bowl on top. Make sure that the bottom of the bowl is not touching the surface of the water. Also, make sure that the bowl is big enough to fit all of your icing ingredients., Make sure that the bowl is fitted, and that the stem can't escape. This will allow you to slowly melt your ingredients without fear of scorching them., Don't add the chocolate chips yet. If you aren't a fan of almond, you can use a different flavor instead, such as lemon or peppermint., At this point, you can turn down the heat on the burner; as long as there is steam, you will be fine. Keep stirring until the chocolate chips melt and everything turns smooth.Using white chocolate chips will allow you to change the color of the icing by adding in food coloring. If you don't care about the color and don't like white chocolate, you can use regular chocolate chips instead., Although not completely necessary, this can give your icing a lovely color! Keep in mind that a little bit goes a long way, so you won't need a lot of gel food coloring. Opt for light, pastel shades rather than bright or dark colors.  The food coloring will only work with white chocolate chips, not regular chocolate chips. Do not use liquid food coloring, as this may cause the icing to ""seize"" and become grainy.   , You will be decorating your petit fours on this rack. The parchment paper will catch any excess icing. You can then melt the icing in your double boiler and reuse it.If you don't have any more parchment paper, you can use wax paper for this instead.  , Something between 1 and 1¼ inch (2.54 and 3.18 centimeters) would be ideal.You can also cut the petit fours into other simple shapes as well, such as hearts, circles, or rectangles. Make sure that your shapes are around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) however!, Make sure that you have some space between each square to allow the icing to drip through., Make sure that your pour the icing evenly, and that it completely covers the squares. You don't want to see any cake or filling at all. The icing should cover the sides of the petit fours in a smooth layer; you don't want any dribbles.  Don't worry if the icing layer looks thin. You can fix that in a moment.  , While you wait for the icing to set, take the excess icing off of the baking sheet below the cooling rack, and melt it in your double boiler. Pour the icing back over the petit fours as before. This will create a thicker layer.You only need to do this if your first layer is thin. If you can see bits of cake or filling, then your icing layer is too thin, and you should apply a second one.  , At this point, your petit fours are essentially done, but you can decorate them even further to match the theme of your party or event. A quick and simple decoration would be to pipe little rosettes on top of each petit four. You can also use sugar candy shaped like flowers instead, or drizzle melted, colored chocolate on top. Other popular designs include polka dots, strips, and bows.","['water', 'corn syrup', 'white chocolate chips', 'sugar', 'top', 'layers', 'powdered sugar', 'medium heat', 'vanilla extract', 'wire cooling rack', 'minutes', 'thin cardboard', 'batter', 'boil', 'buttercream frosting', 'mixture', 'prepared pan', '° c', 'flour', 'sour cream', 'everything', 'double boiler', 'half-sheet pan', 'salt', 'bottom layer', 'sides', 'line', 'thin layer', 'freezer', 'edge', 'icing', 'milk', 'top layer', 'coat', 'petit', 'powder', 'cake', 'raspberry jam', 'sheet', 'extracts', 'square', 'time', 'sugar mixture', 'smooth', 'gel food', 'ladle', 'top half', 'half', 'parchment paper', 'eggs', 'medium speed', 'separate bowl', 'oven', 'jam', 'small squares', 'bowl', 'cut squares', 'medium-sized bowl', 'sharp knife', 'flour mixture', 'edges', 'cake cool']"
"['understand how an icd works', 'learn about your condition and the reason(s) why you need this device', 'in the first few weeks after the surgery', 'avoid putting your arm on the side the device was inserted over your head', 'be prepared for changes', 'carry an id card indicating you have an icd', 'when possible', 'stay away from anything that may cause interference to your icd', 'avoid rough sports that use constant body contact', 'beware of driving', 'especially within the first few months of implantation', 'respond calmly to shock experiences', 'an icd may be a good choice for you at one time in your life', 'but sometimes health status changes over time (due to heart or other disease progression) can make the icd less beneficial', 'attend your regular appointments with your cardiologist']",How to Live With an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator,"   There are two main parts that make up the device: the leads, which are thin wire electrodes attached to your heart that monitor the rhythm, and the generator (often referred to as the actual ICD), which provides and delivers the electricity during a shock. Most ICDs also have a pacemaker function, as well. The electrodes are attached to your heart, either in one or both ventricles, and continuously monitor the electrical impulses of the heart. When it detects a potentially life-threatening rhythm (arrhythmia), the ICD will provide one of three possible treatments:   Cardioversion: Giving a shock at a specific time during the cardiac cycle to try to convert the arrhythmia to a normal sinus rhythm (NSR).  Defibrillation: Shocking a large mass of the heart muscle to depolarize it, reset the cells (therefore, terminating the arrhythmia), and allow the SA node to reestablish NSR. This procedure is often depicted in the media with paddles/pads and the patient violently jerking.  Pacing: Using the built-in pacemaker, a series of short bursts of electricity are given in time with the heartbeat to slow it down.  ; ,   People who survive cardiac arrests, have been diagnosed with an arrhythmia, and are at a high risk of sudden cardiac death are often candidates for an ICD implantation. Survivors of heart attacks may also get ICDs. The two arrhythmias that ICDs treat originate from the ventricles of the heart. These are:   Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach/VT): An abnormally fast heart rate (over 100 beats per minute). This is treated with cardioversion if a pulse is found. However, if left untreated, it could degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (see below).  Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib/VF): The heart muscle is uncontrollably contracting, making the heart quiver rather than pump blood. It is an extremely dangerous arrhythmia because blood flow to the brain is stopped, depriving it from oxygen. This is treated with defibrillation. However, if left untreated for more than a few seconds, it's likely to degenerate into asystole (""flatline""); brain damage and even death occurs if this continues for more than 5 minutes.   Before the procedure, make sure that you fully understand your condition and the reason why an ICD is needed. Ask your doctors, read pamphlets, or even talk to other patients who have ICDs.  , Do all such actions with your other hand.  , Although your lifestyle will remain unchanged, there are a few considerations you'll have to make. For example, you may have to adjust your seat belt shoulder harness if the ICD was implanted in your upper chest. If you find an item of clothing creates pressure around your upper chest, you may have to stop wearing it. Adjust your lifestyle according to such things becoming apparent to you when going about your normal activities.  , When you're having any procedure done, tell your doctor, dentist, or other health care professional about your ICD.   Since it's made of metal, the ICD may set off metal detectors and other security devices found in airports and other places. Show your card to security personnel––keep it with your other travel documents for ease of retrieval.  , This consists of objects emitting radio waves or magnetic fields. Often, you will receive a booklet containing a list of electronics to watch out for. Some examples include:   MRIs (strongly avoid), radio-transmitting towers and ham radios. Common household items such as cell phones, kitchen appliances, microwaves, hairdryers, and electric blankets are safe to use as long as they are 6 inches (15 cm) away from the device.  , Examples include football, wrestling, and boxing. Be alert and watch for any balls that could hit the implantation site. This may even include taking precautions as a spectator where there is a possibility that a ball could leave the field or pitch and end up in the audience area.  , You could suddenly become unconscious or startled when a shock appears, causing you to lose control of your car.  , A third to a half of ICD recipients experience an ICD shock in the first year of implantation.While it's likely that you'll be unconscious before the shock occurs, many patients often describe them as painful kicks to the chest. If you get a shock, contact your cardiologist promptly.   Planning is vital for dealing with ICD shocks. Being aware that they're a possibility and knowing the difference between when you need to seek emergency help or to make a doctor's appointment is important for reassuring yourself about the effects of the shock. It is recommended that you discuss post-shock actions with your doctor or cardiologist and rehearse your response so that when it happens, it feels normal to respond in a certain way. Always have your ICD identification card and information with you or easily accessible, a list of your current medications and your doctor's contact details. This will reassure you and it can also help anyone else who needs to use the information to help you. Train your family and friends in what to do if you experience a shock. Explain to them what to look for when it happens and how they can help you. Having a supportive team with you can make an enormous difference to staying positive after the shock. Practice deep breathing and relaxing responses to help you to stay calm when shock occurs. Becoming hyper-aroused (such as panicking, shallow breathing, etc.) can escalate the impact unnecessarily. Some people recommended meditation as a daily action to help you stay mindful of your reactions to stressful situations. Seek help for psychological responses to ICD shock. It is normal to feel anxiety or depression, worry and fear with respect to an ICD shock. These psychological effects are often associated with the uncertainty of when a shock will appear or what the outcome of it might be (including fear of death). These fears will slowly decrease as you get more used to your ICD but it's important to get help through talking to people who can reassure you. For many people an ICD is better than no ICD; if and when a shock occurs, it is at least reminding you that you have the best care keeping you healthy. Consider your personal values, and ICD benefits and burdens, when deciding if an ICD is right for you.  , Discuss a plan for this possibility with your doctor, before the ICD is implanted.  , It is very important to get your ICD checked on a regular basis. During appointments, you will undergo an ECG to examine your heart's electrical activity. Depending on your condition, checkups may range from every 4-6 months to a yearly appointment. These times are also good for asking your doctor questions or if you have concerns.

Try peanut butter oatmeal raisin. Mix 1 cup of oatmeal, 1 Tbsp peanut butter, and 1/4 cup raisins for a quick, easy meal. Add 1 cup of orange juice for a healthy drink. Cook two scrambled eggs with 2 Tbsp low-fat milk, using 1 tsp vegetable oil. Add two turkey sausage links, one slice whole wheat toast with 1 tsp jelly. Drink one delicious cup of freshly squeezed orange juice. Whip up one serving of scrambled tofu. Put it in an 8” flour tortilla, with 1/4 cup black beans, and 2 Tbsp salsa. Wash it down with 1 cup of low-fat milk., Eat a light lunch with plenty of variety, mixing in veggies and other healthy choices. There are many creative ways to make delicious lunches. Here are a few great examples:   Have a green salad. Put 3 oz of tuna with 1 cup of romaine lettuce, 1/4 cup of sliced carrots, and 2 Tbsp of vinaigrette dressing. Pair it with a slice of whole-wheat bread with 1 tsp of margarine. Drink 1 cup low-fat milk. Eat a peanut butter and banana sandwich by combining 2 Tbsp of peanut butter and one medium banana on two slices of whole-wheat bread. Add 1/2 cup celery sticks for veggies, and 1 cup of low-fat milk for the beverage. Make a roast beef sandwich with 2 oz lean roast beef between two slices whole-wheat bread. Add two tomato slices, one leaf of romaine lettuce, and 1 Tbsp of mayo. Have 1/2 cup of carrot sticks as a side. Add 1 cup of sliced apple with a Tbsp of peanut butter for dessert., Create some simple, family-friendly recipes sure hit the health, diversity, and taste marks. A few options follow:   Try some Red Hot Fusilli Pasta. Sauté 2 garlic cloves and 1/4 cup parsley in 1 Tbsp of olive oil. Then add 4 cups of ripe, chopped tomatoes along with 1 Tbsp basil, 1 Tbsp oregano, 1/4 tsp salt, and ground red pepper. Once thickened, put it over 4 cups cooked fusilli pasta. Add 2 Tbsp shredded Parmesan cheese to taste, and cook 1/2 cup green peas (with 1/2 tsp margarine) as a side. Finish off the meal with a white roll and 1 tsp margarine.

When asking for leave, you'll want to make sure you're asking for an appropriate amount of days.You can look in your company's handbook, or online, to find their sick leave policy. You can also talk to the HR Department if anything is still unclear. You'll want to mention your company's policy in your letter. This both shows that you're adhering to policy and reminds your boss of what you are entitled to as an employee. If you have questions about your company's medical leave policies, you can always contact your HR department and ask about their specific guidelines.; , A doctor's note may be required if you're requesting sick leave. This is not always a requirement, and it depends on the policy of your company. If you do need a doctor's note, ask your doctor to provide you one. Do so at least a few weeks in advance (if possible) so you can get all your materials together before you need to take sick leave.  , A medical leave letter needs to be specific. Before submitting your medical leave letter, you should make sure you know the exact dates during which you'll be gone.Double check the date of your procedure. Have your doctor verify how long the recovery will be, and how much time you'll need off work. Make sure your sick leave falls within the appropriate restrictions of your company's policy.  , Business letters follow a specific format. A medical leave letter is not different. Before writing your letter, make sure it is formatted correctly.Write down your company's address at the top of the letter. Below this, write the date in the format month, date, and year. For example, ""June 5th, 2016."" When you begin the letter, start with a salutation that begins with ""Dear."" Then, write your boss's name using his or her preferred personal title (e.g., Mr., Mrs., etc.).  , Your introductory paragraph need not be long. You simply need to write the reason for writing the letter, why you need a leave of absence, and the dates you'll be absent from work. As your boss is likely busy, keep this letter brief and to the point.You can begin with something like, ""I am writing this letter to ask for a leave of absence from work for medical reasons. According to company policy, I am entitled to 10 days of medical absence a year."" From there, state the medical concerns and the dates when you'll be absent. For example, ""I am having my gallbladder removed. My surgery is on Thursday the 16th, and I will require 7 days of recovery. I should be back to work by the following Thursday, the 23rd.""  , If you have an unusual medical condition, it may be necessary to explain. Something like maternity leave is largely self-explanatory, but more unusual reasons for medical leave may require some explanation. This can help your boss see why your leave is necessary. You do not need to provide a lot of details, but a little information can help.For example, you can write something like, ""I am having a suspicious mole removed for a biopsy this Monday. There will be further medical tests to assure I do not have melanoma, which is a form of skin cancer. I will be held up in procedures from Monday to Thursday. I should be able to return to work Friday."" Be brief when writing your letter; there's no need for embellishment. Just stick to the facts to keep it professional. If you live in the United States, there are specific laws to protect your privacy, known as HIPAA. Your employer should not request more information than is necessary, and they have obligations to maintain your privacy under certain conditions., Your boss needs to know you plan on keeping up with your responsibilities during your absence. Your boss will want to know the status of your work, and how it will be completed while you're gone.If you're assigning your work to other colleagues, mention this. Make sure you ask the colleagues beforehand and get confirmation that they can take on your projects. Write something like, ""The Henderson account will be managed by Charlie Hanson until my return."" If you plan on working remotely, let your boss know. For example, ""While I will be laid up after my knee surgery, I'll still be able to carry on much of my duties. I plan to work remotely and Skype into meetings during my absence.""  , Let your boss know how he or she can reach you if you're needed during your absence. Include the best phone number and email your boss can use to contact you.If there's any time you know you'll be unavailable, mention this. For example, ""You can reach me on my regular cell phone most of the time. However, my surgery is Thursday so I will be unable to take work-related calls then.""  , Close the letter by offering your boss a sincere thank you for considering your application. For example, say something like, ""Thank you so much for taking the time to consider my medical leave."" Then, add a formal sign off, like ""sincerely,"" before signing your name at the bottom of the letter.If you're adding an enclosure to the letter, like a doctor's note, make sure to write ""Enclosure"" one line below your name at the bottom of the letter, followed by a description of the enclosure.  , It's a good idea to proofread your letter before you send it out to make sure it's free of obvious errors. If possible, have a friend or colleague quickly proofread your letter before you send it to your boss.Set the letter aside for a few hours and then come back to it with fresh eyes. This can help you catch errors. You could also try to print the letter out if you typed it. You may have a better chance of catching your own errors when not reading on a screen.  , Check company policy again. They may have special policies for business letters. For example, your office may require specific formatting or may ask that you use the company letterhead.  , Send the letter out when you're done. Make sure you follow company policy regarding how to send letters and memos. Do not, for example, e-mail the letter as an attachment if your boss prefers letters be sent physically.

Ditch the bar of soap and get a good quality face wash to start your makeup routine. Fill your bathroom basin with lukewarm water and splash some on your face (this is also great for waking you up in the morning) and then squeeze pea size amounts of facial wash on to your hand and massage it into your face with circular motions and then rinse it off with the water and pat your face dry with a towel.; , Get a little cotton pad and put a little bit of the toner onto it and then wipe it all over your face. This leaves your face cool and refreshed while evening out your complexion and removing any dirt your cleanser has missed.  , Find a moisturiser that's good for your skin type. Most skin care brands make a moisturiser for all types of skin. Dab bits of moisturiser on your cheeks, nose, chin and forehead then with the excess in your hand, rub your hands together with circular motions and massage the moisturiser on to your skin.   Sometimes you might want to apply a cream at night. To do this, get a little bit on your ring finger and pat it under your eye.  , This will help your make-up to stay on all day. Just apply it like you would apply your moisturiser.  , Find a foundation that matches your skin tone perfectly. If you can't, then go for a shade lighter. Put just little onto the back of your hand, then with a foundation brush start applying it around the nose than work outwards, only use a little because it's easier to apply more than to remove it. Make sure it is properly blended so that it does not look like you're wearing anything on your face.  , Find one that brightens for under your eyes. You can either use a brush or your finger. If you're using a brush, put a little concealer on your hand then dab the brush in it and use light feathery strokes to apply it under your eyes, around your nose and on any blemishes. If you are using your finger do the exact same thing but try to pat it in as that will give better coverage.  , Pressed powder usually gives a bit more coverage than loose powder. Use a big fluffy brush and apply just a little on your face to set your make-up.  , Blusher gives you a rosy glow on your cheeks. Bronzer gives you defined cheekbones and a sun-kissed glow. Apply it with a fluffy angled brush; either apply it where the sun would normally hit (your cheeks, forehead, and nose) or apply it in the hollows of your cheekbones to give yourself a more sculptured face. For blush, you can either apply it on the apples of your cheeks or just below your cheekbones all the way up to your hairline.  , Any color of eyeshadow that is flattering for your skin and eyes will do. If you choose a shimmery champagne colour and use a fluffy eyeshadow brush, make sure to sweep it all over the lid. If you want to add some more depth, apply a darker brown colour in the outer corner and crease.  , Eyeliner is optional, but for school, a brown eyeliner is a more natural choice. You could apply it on your water line and tight line, or you could just apply it on your lid close to your lash line.  , For mascara, a waterproof one is a good choice if you have sports or PE (Physical Education/Exercise) and want to keep your makeup fresh. Comb the brush through your lashes and wiggle it every now and then. You could apply it on the bottom lashes also.  , If you want to, you can accentuate your eyebrows as well. You could use a brow gel, pencil or powder to do this. For pencil, use light feathery strokes and brush through your lashes afterwards for a more natural look. For powder, use a little angled brush and again use light feathery strokes and brush through after.  , For lips, keep it very natural. Apply a lipbalm for soft kissable lips and you leave it as that, or apply either a clear or light coloured lipgloss.

Bigger, more substantial and important resources (like Meat, Pig Skins, Silk, and Beefalo fur) can be a bit more difficult to farm, but are definitely worth it. Some are only available in certain places, like Monster Meat, Gems Cave Bananas, Tentacle Spikes, Fish, and Frog Legs. So before everything else, consider what you want to farm or what you consider to be most important to farm, since this will determine where your base camp will be.  At most, a few “food” structures, some way to get manure, and some other surface resources (like Saplings and Grass Tufts) would be enough to ensure your continued, self-sustaining survival for several weeks at a time, even in Winter. More advanced builds include sustainable farming in rarer or more uncommon in hazardous places, such as Marshes, Caves and Ruins, and it’s only advisable if the player prepares themselves to farm there with a clear safety net in close reach, like a Touch Stone or a Meat Effigy.; , Before getting hyped up to make a sprawling, complicated farm, consider first if your materials are easily renewable at this point.  For example, Bees and Honey are infinitely renewable as long as there’s a Hive or a Bee Box, but Honeycomb, which you get from destroying Bee Hives, are not. You can dig up Saplings, Berry Bushes, and Grass Tufts and replant them, but while their resources are renewable every 4 days, the objects themselves are not. Gold is infinitely renewable if you go down the Caverns and wait for an Earthquake, or find a Pig King to give Meat to, but most Gravedigger items, like Gnomes, Gears, and Hardened Rubber Bungs are not renewable. The only renewable items you get from digging up Graves are Gems, Life Giving Amulets, and Nightmare Fuel, since they can be found and made elsewhere. Checking the Wiki for the complete list is advisable for the new or unsure players, but generally speaking, if it’s a treasure, or if you can’t plant it or raise it, you usually can’t renew it. Thulecite and Gems (Green, Yellow, or Orange) are very rare resources in the Ruins and aren’t reliably renewed. However, in Reign of Giants, they have a chance to be found in Tumbleweeds, making them renewable. Same with the most Gravedigger items and Fireflies.  , The best area to camp in is a Grasslands with all the other biomes within a few seconds to a minute away from you. This will give you a wide area to place your base in, and the Grasslands also provide you with some easy resources you can relocate to your camp with a Shovel. If not, look for places with a concentration of your prefered resources. For example, if you want to farm Fish and Frog Legs, scout out a Grassland area full of Ponds. If you want to farm Beefalo for their fur, Meat, and Manure, check out a Savannah full of them.  If you make a camp between multiple Biomes, make sure you scout out the others first. It would do you no good if you camp beside a Savannah with no Beefalo if you plan on farming them. If you can find a Worm Hole leading to some further places with plenty of resources, by all means make camps near them. Just remember that traveling through them costs some Sanity in return.  , Of course, tools don’t just mean an Axe, Pickaxe, and Shovel. You’ll also need a Shovel to relocate Grass Tufts, Berry Bushes, and Saplings, or to dig out tree stumps to make room for your stuff. Hammers are also useful to break down natural structures you can find in the world to gather more resources. However, those aren’t the only tools you can use for survival.  You’ll be needing plenty of Traps to farm Rabbits, Frogs, and Spiders, for example. Bird Traps are exclusively for farming Birds for their Feathers and Morsels, or to raise as your main source of Eggs and Crop Seeds. And, of course, you’ll need Tooth Traps, weaponry, and armor to farm some of the bigger animals and ward off the periodic Hound attacks. You’ll also be needing more advanced crafting stations for some of the more unusual and useful objects. An Alchemy Engine is the minimum requirement for your major crafting needs, especially in the next section.  , Now, it’s time to get into the structures you can build! There’s quite a lot of things you can make under the Food tabs and Structures tabs, and most of them are vital for survival. Some of them can be a bit expensive, some of them cheap, but all of them are useful as long as you know how to use them.  Farm Plots are the easiest to make, requiring 6 Cut Grass, 4 Logs, and 4 Manure for the Basic model, and 10 Cut Grass, 4 Rocks, and 6 Manure for the Advanced model. If you can’t find a lot of naturally-spawning Pigs nearby, you can make your own Pig House. It costs 4 Boards, 3 Cut Stone, and 4 Pig Skin. (Pig Skin usually requires you to kill some Pigs, but if you can find a Touch Stone anywhere or some Merm houses in a Marsh, you can just hammer the Pig Heads to gather the Skins.) Making a Bird Cage is a bit expensive, at 2 Papyrus, 6 Gold, and 2 Seeds, but the yield from trapping a bird in it is worth it. Bee Boxes may be tricky; aside from 2 Boards, you have to destroy a Bee Hive to get the necessary Honeycomb and capture 4 Bees, but the yield is low-risk and high-return. There’s a lot more structures you can make that can help your survival, but for your farming needs, these are the most important, since they are highly renewable and definitely profitable even early on in the game!  , There are several structures that can help you prevent damage to your farm.  Craft a Lightning Rod and place it near important structures. This will prevent any freak lightning strikes from burning your farm to sad, expensive ashes. Placing Stone Walls and Tooth Traps around most of your structures is heavily advised as well, in case of Hound attacks. The exceptions are Pig Houses, since they can fight back and tend to trigger the Tooth Traps.  , There’s many ways to continuously farm your resources, especially if you’re clever enough. The main types will be outlined here, with some methods in farming certain resources. The guide won’t delve into all of the resources that you can farm, but will show some resources and the methods to farm them, mainly the Surface resources., This method mainly involves the Farm Plots you made, and the Saplings, Berry Bushes and Grass Tufts you dug up. This method is completely static, with the lowest level of interference from the player. When you plant the seeds into the Farm Plots, you can either wait to get your food, which will take about a day or so, or if you’re the impatient type, you can just fertilize it continuously until a fresh crop pops up. To fertilize them, you need Manure or Rot. To get Rot, just leave out some food; to get Manure, hand out some non-meat food to Pigs so they’ll poop themselves, or follow some Beefalo around until they poop themselves.  Reeds, a Marsh-exclusive resource, can’t be dug up and relocated like Grass Tufts, since it destroys the tuft that grows the Reeds. You can’t dig up Rabbit Holes or Mushrooms up either for the same reasons. Which means you manually have to gather them yourself. When you place Grass Tufts and Berry Bushes on the ground, you’ll also need to fertilize them before they can start growing their resources. Just 1 unit of any fertilizer will do. Saplings don’t need to be fertilized, and they all renew their respective resources every 4 days. For maximum efficiency, group your crops together in different areas, and place Lightning Rods in the middle of each crop farm. This is because these kinds of farm are highly flammable, and one stray lightning bolt is enough to burn everything down.  , One of the first objects you can craft is the humble Trap, which has a very cheap cost, easily renewable, and has quite a lot of uses. Spiders, Rabbits, and Frogs are susceptible to getting caught under Traps, and picking up rustling Traps would yield you goodies to eat, and in the Spiders’ case, make Silk and Spider Glands renewable with the least amount of effort. For the Rabbits, placing a Trap directly above the Rabbit Hole is the best way to catch them. For Spiders and Frogs, place the Traps around the Spider Den or the Pond. You’ll need to check on the Traps for the Frogs and the Rabbits at around Dusk, while checking for the Spiders are best left for morning. This is because Frogs and Rabbits spawn during daytime, while Spiders roam around at Night.  Remember not to step on the “webbing” surrounding Spider Dens unless you want to purposely attract Spiders towards you and the trap. Bird Traps are best left alone with a single Seed in them, but must be checked every few minutes, since they also spawn during dusk. Crows are more common in the Rockylands all year round, while Grasslands find itself with more Redbirds, which are found in the Summer, and Snowbirds, which are found in Winter. You’ll be better off saving one bird to keep in the Bird Cage. This is so you can have a renewable source of Eggs and Crop Seeds. Eggs are useful for recipes, feeding Pigs, or trading with the Pig King, while Crop Seeds are useful if you wish to farm specific Fruits or Vegetables, like Dragon Fruits or Pumpkins. To get eggs, you can feed the bird most kinds of meat, excluding Monster Meat (cooked or raw). To get Crop Seeds, feed it a specific crop you want, excluding Berries, Mandrakes, Lichen, Cave Bananas, or Mushrooms, and it will drop 1 or 2 seeds of that crop. You can feed it any of the above foods in any level of spoilage to constantly recycle and renew your food sources. You can also feed the bird any Seeds in any state of freshness to get fresher Seeds.  , Some resources, like Trees, Pigs, Spiders, and Beefalo, tend to multiply and spread when you get the conditions right, or when you use their farmed resources to create more of them. This is basically called the “Breeding” method, and while all of them aren’t naturally self-replicating, the resources are highly and easily renewable with only the occasional interference on your part.  Trees are the easiest to “breed” and farm out of all these resources. All you need is a Pinecone, a Shovel, and an Axe. Whenever you fell a tree with your Axe, the tree will drop a Pinecone (two, if you chop a full grown one). You can then plant the Pinecone(s) in a nearby, cleared area, then wait about a full game day for it to grow into a small tree. Wait about another day for it to spawn a medium tree, or a few more days for it to become a full grown tree. Pig Houses spawn a single pig at a time, and if that one is killed, another one takes his place four days after he’s killed. This means you can keep killing that Pig for Meat and Pig Skin, ensuring that you can build another Pig House and increase your Pigs. With this method, you can probably make your own Pig Village in a few weeks’ time. In RoG, you need to keep your Pigs away from your base camp. This is because during the full moon, the Pigs may turn into Werepigs, which can wreak havoc on you and your resources, so keeping them near but away from your camp or other farms is a must. Beefalo have “mating seasons” where they grow aggressive for a few days and spawn a few Baby Beefalo at the end, making their Meat, Beefalo Wool, and Manure infinitely renewable, as long as at least 2 Beefalo remain before every mating season. You can lure them into a “pen” made out of Walls and Savannah Turf by using a Beefalo Horn, which you can get from killing Beefalo. Don’t kill the Beefalo while they’re near any others, since they attack as a herd. Set up some Tooth Traps in the pen to automatically cull the herd occasionally. If you want a more controlled way to farm Spiders, fully grown Spider Dens can spawn a Spider Queen whenever you walk into the webbing, and she spawns a smaller Spider Den and several Spiders in turn while trying her best to maim you. If you slay her, you get a set of Spider Eggs, which you can place down to spawn a single Den, or you can leave her alone for a few minutes, and she’ll settle back down as a small Spider Den in an area away from any other Dens. The second method lets you “breed” more Dens with minimum risk, but the first method lets you place your Den wherever you want, as well as acquire a rare item, the Spider Hat, which lets you interact with Spiders with minimum risk. If you have a Berry farm and want to farm Gobblers as well, place some Tooth Traps inside the Berry farm so that when one spawns, it is messily murdered and you are free to take its delicious, meaty corpse for your dinner. They’re available in the original edition and RoG and have a low spawn rate, since they spawn whenever you pick Berries. Be careful though, since even one spawning will definitely ruin your Berry farm, as it just keep eating every Berry it sees in a single screen before wandering off. It will also attack any crop food you leave on the ground, meaning you can lure it with a carrot or a single berry towards the tooth traps if you don’t mind some of your Berries being eaten. Bee Boxes also count as a “breeding” method, since it respawns a Bee every 2 minutes whenever one from the box is killed, for a maximum of 4 Bees per Box. The box itself starts to get visibly covered in honey whenever it’s almost full, and you can harvest it for a maximum of 6 Honey. To minimize damage from Bees, craft a Beekeeper’s Hat. This will reduce the damage taken by a whopping 80%.  , Some resources are utterly hostile or uncontrollable, but respawn dependably. Nearly every hostile enemy can be farmed reliably, but it’s normally really risky. Luring them into Tooth Traps or nearby Pigs, Beefalo, or Tentacles will help tremendously, as long as you're quick when gathering your spoils. But here are some general guides on how to beat them if you’re low on resources or don’t have those available around you.  If you found a Plugged Sinkhole, you can go down or wait for dusk for Batsilisks to appear. In the Caverns, they spawn everywhere, but on the surface, they will spawn from the Sinkhole every dusk and occasionally drop Guano, which is the best fertilizer in the game. Killing them will yield you Batsilisk Wings and some Monster Meat as well, and can be killed with most weapons and Tooth Traps with one or two hits. The Tallbirds that live in the Rockylands are viciously tough and can usually kill you in 2 hits. But they’re easy to beat of you hit them once, run away, then hit them again. They respawn about a day and a half, as long as their nests in the Rockylands remain untouched and undamaged. Occasionally, you can find Suspicious Piles of Dirt on the ground, and unearthing it will yield a footprint. Following it will lead you to another pile to unearth and reveal another print, and you need to repeat this until you find your quarry: the Koalefant. You can chase it into a pen if you desire a pet, since it occasionally drops Manure, but it’s much better if you kill it, since it would drop a considerable amount of Meat and a Koalefant Trunk. While it’s inclined to fight back if you attack it, it’s less risky to hunt it down than some of the other creatures.  In RoG, the risk increases exponentially with the introduction of the Varg. It has a low chance to spawn instead of Koalefants if you track down the footprints and calls for Hound reinforcements the longer you take to kill him. He yields about 6 Monster Meat and 1-3 Hound Teeth upon death, not counting the possible spoils when killing his cohorts.   Hounds spawn every few days to maim the player and make their life miserable, and with their speed, ability to spawn wherever you are when the time comes, and the fact that they love to hunt in groups, it can be difficult to kill them without help. What you can do is make a structure called a “panic room,” which is a three-wall thick room or corridor with Bee Mines, and eventually, Tooth Traps lined in and around it to thin the pack and leave you the weakened stragglers, and then run there when you start hearing barking and growling. You can probably fight them off the first few “months” of the game, but the longer you play, the more of them hunt you down whenever they arrive.  , Ponds, Tentacles, Pig Kings, even the random animals you find in the world can also be used to farm resources. They all have different gimmicks, but with them around, you can renew quite a lot of your resources just by knowing how to deal with them.  If you’re lucky enough, you may be able to find a Pig King when exploring the world. He’ll trade you Gold Nuggets for Gravedigger Items and Meat (excluding monster meat and its byproducts) items, so if you have a reliable way to farm meat, you can use him to constantly renew your stock of Gold. It’s better if you use Morsels and Eggs rather than Meat, since they’re all worth the same amount of Gold to the Pig King, but Meat is more useful to the player. If you can easily access the Ruins and a Ruins Pond, you can just fish out several Eel, cook them, and bring them to the Pig King. For the player, Eel are functionally identical to the regular Fish they can get from normal Ponds, but it’s worth 4 Gold to the Pig King. If you find a nearby Marsh, you can also probably spot some Rundown Shacks, Tentacles, and Merms. What you can do is pit them against each other by luring the Merm towards a spot that’s bubbling, then watch as the Merm and the Tentacle duel it out until one dies! Then when one dies, pick the item up quickly and repeat the process! This will net you quite a lot of Fish, Frog Legs, and even Tentacle Spots and Tentacle Spikes when the Tentacle finally dies! This isn’t infinitely renewable though, but it’s a great way to get a lot of resources quickly! If you venture into the Caverns, you’ll periodically experience Earthquakes shaking the place up. This will drop quite a lot of mineral items (rocks, gems, flint, etc.) on the ground, and Rabbits and Moleworms in RoG. Just make sure to dodge the falling items, since they can damage you. This also ensures a lot of materials to be infinitely, if somewhat unreliably, renewable. You can trigger earthquakes by igniting Gunpowder, Slurtle Slime, Slurtle Mounds, Slurtle, and Snurtle using a Telelocator Staff or the RoG-only item Old Bell, or by beating a Big Tentacle. In the Caverns, you’ll sometimes see a ridiculously huge Tentacle reaching towards the Surface, officially called a Big Tentacle. Players affectionately refer to it as the Tentapillar, and beating one of them makes them retreat into their holes instead of dying, making Tentacle Spikes, Light Bulbs, and Tentacle Spots renewable. The Tentapillar spawns smaller Tentacles, called Baby Tentacles, to protect it, but those are ridiculously weak and take 1 hit from most weapons before dying. This is an RoG-only method, but is useful for the player too unprepared to dive in the caves for minerals. Simply dig up any Moleworm Holes, which are visually larger and “messier” than Rabbit Holes, and it will yield you some amount of rocks, flint, nitre, and occasionally gold. This is infinitely renewable, since Moleworms tend to just spawn new holes whenever they can’t find a nearby one.  You can also catch Moleworms by laying down a Rock or a Flint, then whacking them on the head with a Hammer when they emerge. Then you can pick up the materials, dig up the hole they made, set them free, and lure them again!   Another RoG-only method that makes renewing some unusual items easily is by constantly feeding or giving “gifts” to nearby Catcoons. Catcoons will eat “small” meat items like morsels, fish and eggs, and you can give them easily acquired items like cut grass, twigs and pinecones to befriend them. In return, after a while, they’ll barf up other items, like Crop Seeds, Petals, and even Tumbleweeds. Catcoons also tend to attack Butterflies and Birds, so setting down a lot of Flowers and some Seeds in an enclosed area with a Hollow Stump in it would ensure a quick and easy way to farm Butter, Butterfly Wings, Feathers, and Morsels—if you’re quick enough to gather them before the Catcoon takes them for itself.  , Scheduling when your harvests take place is useful if you’re fond of exploring, or you can set up several farms in several places. Most farmable resources are renewed every few days, so what you can do is harvest one or two farms every day, then all you need to do is wait for your resources to renew itself. This will keep you from frantically rushing everywhere and wasting time, with huge periods of time without anything to do. This will also free up some time for exploration if you time your harvests just right., While this is more of an organizational thing, this will help greatly in case of Hound attacks, “boss” monsters and Giants trying to wreck your place, and the occasional unlucky fire. It can also help keep mobs that heavily dislike each other from killing each other off too fast. At the minimum, structures and static farms should be about 2 spaces away from each other, and farms using living things should be about half a screen or more away., Normally, this isn’t a problem, but sometimes the frequent usage of a resource can outstrip the production of the item. Trees need to be replanted, Ponds have delay times the more you fish, and Beefalo don’t breed as often as some players think they should. Don’t be overeager when harvesting from your farm, especially when winter approaches, since a lot of resources, especially crops, grass, and twigs, stop production entirely when the cold hits. Give your farms time to recover their resources instead of killing and looting everything and having nothing left when you really need it.","['types', 'biomes', 'harvesting', 'farms', 'plots', 'good area', 'traps', 'farm', 'resources', 'short distance', 'tools', 'hunting', 'eye', 'structures']"

The remaining 64 cards become the draw pile, or stock.  , This card forms the discard pile, or pack. Players may, in turn, draw the top card from either the stock or the pack. If a player takes the top card from the discard pile, he also takes the cards underneath it.   Throughout the game, you see cards come and go that you want. You'll have to determine whether taking the whole pile is worth the few cards you want. If the card turned over is a red 3 (3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds) or a wild card (joker or deuce), the discard pile cannot be taken (it's ""frozen"").  , A turn consists of drawing a card from the draw pile or taking the discard pile, attempting to create or add to an existing meld and discarding a card (unless the player has no cards left after melding).   As discussed previously, a meld consists of 3 or more cards of the same rank (e.g., all kings, all jacks, all 10s). No more than 3 of the cards in a meld can be wild cards (jokers or deuces), and wild cards cannot be melded by themselves. A meld of 7 or more cards is a canasta; each team must complete at least 1 canasta before its players have gotten rid of all the cards in their hands (gone out). Red 3s (3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds) cannot be included in a meld, and black 3s (3 of spades, 3 of clubs) can only be melded by themselves  but only if this permits the player to go out. Players can add only to their own or their partner's melds, not to an opponent's meld. A player can take the discard pile instead of drawing a card from the discard pile only if he or she can use the pile's top card in a new or existing meld in that turn. A player can prevent the next player from taking the discard pile by discarding a black 3 or wild card to end his or her turn.  , Each card has a point value, as described below. The first meld must be 50 points. As the scores progress, the first meld's value increases.   If a team's total score is from 0 to 1,495 points, their initial meld must be worth at least 50 points. If their total is from 1,500 to 2,995, it must be worth at least 90. If their total is over 3,000, it must be worth at least 120. (However, if the team has a negative score, the minimum is reduced to 15.) Only the top card from the discard pile, if it is taken to make the initial meld, may be counted toward making the minimum. Until a team can make an initial meld that meets the minimum value, including or excluding the pack's top card, neither player can take the discard pile. If a player plays an initial meld that fails to meet the minimum, the cards must be taken back and the team's minimum is raised by 10 points.  , If no one has gone out by the time all the cards in the stock have been drawn, play continues as long as someone can take the top card of the discard pile and put it with a new or existing meld. However, no player down to a single card can take a discard pile of a single card.  , Each team scores points for the cards in all the melds it has made. Points are also awarded for having red 3s, making canastas and going out. Scores are added to scores accumulated in previous rounds.   Each canasta made without wild cards (natural canasta) earns 500 points, while each canasta made with wild cards (mixed canasta) earns 300. A player who goes out by melding all his or her cards in 1 turn (concealed) earns 200 points, while a player going out after melding on several successive turns (unconcealed) earns 100 points. Red 3s score 100 points each; if a team has all 4 red 3s, they earn 800 points. However, if a team has red 3s but no melds, they are penalized 100 points for each red 3.  Subtract the total value of any cards remaining in a team's hands from their total score.  , The first team to do so wins. If neither team has done so, the cards are shuffled and the previous 6 steps are repeated.

TSH can be thought of as the metaphorical ""engine"" of the thyroid gland, in that it determines the amount of thyroid hormone that is synthesized and then released from the thyroid into the body. A normal value for TSH is between 0.4 – 4.0 mIU/L.If your TSH is in this range, that is a good sign; however, a normal TSH value does not completely rule out thyroid problems. TSH values on the high end of normal can indicate potential thyroid problems that are evolving. Most thyroid problems require two or more tests to detect and diagnose, given the complex interplay of the various hormones that contribute to thyroid function. Your doctor may order more tests, even if your TSH is normal, if he still suspects that you may have a thyroid problem.; , If your thyroid is underactive, then it is not releasing enough much T4 and T3, and so your pituitary gland will release more TSH to try and compensate.   Thus, a high TSH may be a sign of hypothyroidism (a condition in which your thyroid gland is producing insufficient amounts of hormones). You will need further testing, however, to further investigate and to confirm such a diagnosis.  , Tell your doctor if you are experiencing any of the following signs or symptoms, which may be suspicious for hypothyroidism:   Increased cold sensitivity Fatigue Unexplained weight gain Unusually dry skin Constipation Muscle aches and stiffness Joint pain and swelling Depression and/or other mood changes A slower than normal heart rate Thinning hair Changes to your menstrual cycle Slowed thinking or speaking  , As such, a low TSH may be an indication of hyperthyroidism (excess production of thyroid hormone).   Again, further blood tests will be required to confirm such a diagnosis. A TSH reading alone can point your physician down a certain path, but in itself it is usually not diagnostic.  , Tell your doctor if you are experiencing any of the following signs or symptoms that may be indicative of hyperthyroidism:   A faster than normal heart rate Unexplained weight loss Increased appetite Sweating A tremor, often in your hands Anxiety, irritability, and/or other mood changes Fatigue More frequent bowel movements An enlarged thyroid gland (which can be felt in your neck, and is called a ""goiter"") Trouble sleeping Eyes that bulge or protrude more than they normally do (this sign is present in a certain type of hyperthyroidism called Grave's disease — specifically, the eye abnormality is called ""Grave's ophthalmopathy"")  , Ongoing monitoring can also ensure that your TSH level is within the target range.   The treatment for hypothyroid and hyperthyroid conditions are very different. The target range for thyroid treatment is normally a TSH between 0.4.–4.0 mIU/L, although this may vary depending upon the type of thyroid disorder you have. You will likely receive more frequent monitoring at the start of your treatment, until you settle into a routine where your TSH becomes quite consistent (at which point less frequent monitoring may be appropriate, usually about once every 12 months).  , The normal range for free T4 is between 0.8 – 2.8 ng/dL.   The exact numbers may vary depending on the lab and the specific form of test that is performed. However, most laboratory results have, next to your reading, a designated normal range so that you can easily see whether your T4 is low, normal, or elevated.  , On the other hand, if your TSH value is abnormally low (indicative of possible hyperthyroidism), a high T4 would support the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.   As previously mentioned, the results are best interpreted in conjunction with the TSH value and under the guidance of the medical professional.  , T4 is the main thyroid hormone used in the diagnosis of thyroid conditions. There are certain cases of hyperthyroidism, however, when the T3 becomes significantly elevated and the T4 remains normal (in certain disease states), and this is when the T3 measurement becomes particularly important.   If the T4 is normal but the TSH is low, a high T3 can confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. While the T3 can provide valuable information in diagnosing hyperthyroidism, it does not help to diagnose hypothyroidism. Free T3 is normally between 2.3–4.2 pg/mL in adults over 18 years old. Again, the exact numbers may vary depending on the lab and the specific form of test that is performed. Most laboratory results have, next to your reading, a designated normal range so that you can easily see whether your T3 is low, normal, or elevated.  , The beauty of our medical system is that patients do not have to interpret their own results. Your doctor will order tests and interpret your results. She can provide a diagnosis and begin a treatment plan, which likely will include a combination of medication and lifestyle changes. Having a general working knowledge of the results and what they mean can help you understand the disorder and help understand the treatment for the condition.   Ordering your own tests can be very dangerous and often lead to misguided treatment. You would not try to fix an engine if you did not have training — this is no different.  , Antibody testing is commonly performed, and may lead to important clues as to what is going on with your thyroid.   Thyroid antibody testing can help to differentiate between types of thyroiditis and also autoimmune conditions of the thyroid. TPO (thyroid peroxidase antibody) may be elevated in autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Grave's Disease or Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. TG (thyroglobulin antibody) may also be elevated in Grave's Disease or Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. TSHR (TSH receptor antibodies) may be elevated in Grave's Disease.  , Calcitonin may be elevated in cases of thyroid cancer (which may be the underlying cause behind various forms of thyroid dysfunction). The calcitonin value may also be high in cases of C-cell hyperplasia, which is another form of abnormal growth of cells in the thyroid gland.  , Your physician will let you know if he or she recommends further testing, such as a thyroid ultrasound, a biopsy, or an iodine test.   A thyroid ultrasound may be used to identify thyroid nodules. If any nodules are found, the ultrasound can provide insight as to whether they are solid or cystic (fluid-filled) nodules, both of which are require different modes of treatment. Ultrasound can also be used to monitor any growth or changes to the nodules over time. A thyroid biopsy can take a sample of a suspicious nodule and rule in or rule out the possibility of cancer. An iodine uptake scan can measure which areas of the thyroid are appropriately active (i.e. functional). It can also identify which areas are inactive (non-functional) or hyperactive (excessively functional).

They may be feeling tired, hungry, stressed, or uncomfortable, or they may just want attention. Stopping to put yourself in your child’s shoes may help you understand the causes of the whining, and then you will be better able to take preventative measures.; , Fatigue can contribute to a number of undesirable behaviors, including whining. Aim for an appropriate amount of sleep each night, and consider an earlier bedtime if you notice a lot of crankiness and whining. If your child is preschool-aged or younger, make sure he or she gets an afternoon nap; if your child is elementary-school-aged, give him or her a chance to rest and relax after school.   Children’s individual sleep needs vary, but in general, toddlers between one and three years of age need a total of twelve to fourteen hours a day (including naptime). Three to six year olds need ten to twelve hours a day, and seven to twelve year olds still need ten to eleven hours.  , Hunger makes children uncomfortable and cranky, and it tends to trigger bad behaviors like whining. Many children need small, nutritious snacks between meals, so don’t expect your child to last from lunch to dinner with nothing to eat. For best results, offer a combination of protein, whole grains, and produce: a few whole-grain crackers with peanut butter and a banana, for example.  , Children tend to whine when you tell them to do something they do not want to do. Minimize this problem by offering a warning in advance, rather than suddenly springing something unpleasant on your child. Say, “we’ll have to leave the playground in ten minutes” or “you’ll have to get ready for bed after one more story.” When children know what to expect, they are generally better able to adjust.  , Children often struggle to tolerate being bored; they then whine because they want attention and don’t know how to cope with boredom. If you have a whiny child, try to offer plenty of engaging age-appropriate activities. Whenever possible, some of these activities should take place outdoors, where children can burn excess energy more easily.   If you are noticing issues related to boredom, whining, and decreased attention spans, consider eliminating (or at least minimizing) the time your child spends watching television or playing with electronic devices. These activities may occupy your child and prevent whining in the short term, but they may exacerbate the problem in the long term, leaving your child unable to occupy himself without cartoons or video games.  , When children feel ignored, they often whine to get your attention. You may be able to prevent this by spending quality time with your child, even just in small moments, throughout the day. Parents are so busy that doing so can be difficult, but try:   sitting with your child and having a conversation while he or she eats breakfast stopping for a moment to admire your child’s drawing, block tower, or other creative project taking a ten-minute break from whatever you are doing to read your child a story asking your preschooler or elementary school student to tell you all about his or her day at school setting aside the hour before bedtime for quality family time and a consistent bedtime routine  , Whining often seems to be at its worst when you have to take your child with you on an errand. Children perceive banks, stores, and supermarkets as boring (or, alternatively, as an opportunity to beg for you to buy them things). Avoid whining and other bad behavior by giving your child something to do – he or she can help you find an item on your grocery list, for example.  , When your preventive measures haven’t worked, and your child starts whining, consider trying a more light-hearted approach – especially with younger children. A little fun and silliness can sometimes snap children out of a cranky, whiny mood.  , Toddlers and preschoolers, especially, can sometimes be cajoled into laughing by funny faces. If your young child is whining, and you feel the urge to turn around and scold or yell, try turning around and making a crazy face instead. You may just stop your child in mid-whine and start a fit of laughter.  , Surprise a whining child by turning their behavior around and indulging in some whining yourself. You can even exaggerate for comic effect: “Whyyyyyyyyy are you stiiiiiiiiiiiiilll whiiiiiiining like thaaaaat? I doooooon’t liiiiiiiiike it!” This may serve two separate purposes. First, it may make your child laugh and therefore interrupt the whining cycle. Second, it will let your child know how he or she sounds – younger children may not be fully aware of how annoying and ridiculous whining can sound to others.  , Like imitating your child, recording his or her whining can call attention to how ridiculous it sounds. Use your phone or a tape recorder, and record the whining, then play it back for your child.  , When your child is whining and complaining, speak back in a very soft whisper. Your child will have to stop whining, at least temporarily, to hear what you say, and he or she may start whispering as well. For younger children, this can work as a silly way to interrupt whining and shift the mood.  , Ask your child to repeat his or her request in a different tone or in full sentences. Repeat for dramatic effect: “ooh, I still don’t understand you! I wish I could understand what you are saying! Try again, please! What was that?”  , Once a child reaches elementary school, he or she should usually be able to control objectionable behavior like whining. Explain that you will not allow whining at all, and make it clear that when your child whines, you will not grant his or her requests.  , Make sure your child knows that you will listen to his or her requests and that you like talking to him or her. Just make it clear that discussions need to happen with normal voices, at normal volumes.  , Say, “I know you are upset, but . . .” and explain why you cannot do what your child is requesting. It’s fine to validate your child’s frustration, but don’t give in to an extended discussion when he or she is whining.  , When whining continues, explain that you are not going to listen to it. Send your child to another room until he or she can calm down and speak normally.  , If whining becomes a major problem in your house, let your child know that he or she will get one warning and then a time out for whining. Then stick to your rule. When your child whines, give one clear, firm warning: “You are whining right now. Speak in a normal voice, or you will get a time out.” If the whining continues, enforce the time-out.   A good general rule of thumb, for time outs, is that they should last one minute for each year of your child’s age. In other words, a five year old would stay in time out for five minutes.  , Children should never be rewarded for whining, so whatever the request is, turn it down. Implement time outs or other punishments for continued whining, but otherwise, ignore it. Don’t reward your child’s behavior by giving it undue attention.  , If you get upset, your child will know that he or she can provoke you by whining. Keep your cool.  , Praise your child's efforts to stop whining. Consider celebrating a ""no whining day"" at home, and offer a reward if your child makes it all the way to the end of the day. Make this a fun, light-hearted family event.  , Your child will not stop whining immediately; you’ll need to be firm and consistent, and over time, the behavior will diminish.

You will base your debate outline on that structure. There are two common forms used in schools and competitions. Other forms are simply varieties of these two, changing the amount of time available and the organization of different segments.   Team debates are one of the most common debate forms. In the first half of the debate, each team has two segments to present arguments for their side. In the second half of the debate, each team has two segments to rebut arguments presented in the first half. Lincoln-Douglas debates are set up to allow one side to present their arguments, and then the other team to cross-examine them. The second team then presents their arguments and has the first team cross-examine them. Finally, each team has an opportunity for a final rebuttal.; , Whatever form your debate takes, you will have the opportunity to present your side of the issue. Gather all of your research and look for common arguments. On a piece of paper, list different pieces of evidence under each line of argument. This can include quotes, examples, cases, facts, and statistics. Be sure to note all bibliographical information on your notes.   Use the best research at your disposal, not just the first entries on google, in order to find solid evidence. Visit the library and look for peer-reviewed journals for a good selection of research. For every supporting piece of evidence you find for your case, try to find another piece of evidence to counter it. This will help you build your argument later. It is better to include more points than you think you will need, than not doing enough research and lacking evidence.  , While the order of your material will be determined by your debate form, the format for your debate outline should follow the basic guidelines for outlining. If you are doing your debate for a class, you were likely presented with a rubric which you should be making sure you are following.   Subdivide information. Main headings will probably consist of arguments, while subheadings will contain different pieces of supporting evidence. Use correct symbols. Each level of the outline has a particular symbol to use. The main headings will use Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV). Subheadings use capital letters (A, B, C). Sub-sub headings use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3). Keep these consistent throughout your outline. Indent each level. Indentation helps you follow the line of argument and keeps your outline organized.  , Your case is your primary argument: the value you are trying to uphold through a variety of evidence. Start the outline of your debate by compiling a list of evidence that supports your case. Order it so that the most influential and powerful evidence is the first to be presented, mediocre evidence is in the middle, and a final powerful piece is at the end.If you have a fairly lengthy debate planned, break up your case evidence into categorical sections. For example, you could have legal, moral, and economic support for your case. Aim to have a minimum of three supporting facts or pieces of evidence in your case outline. In debates in particular, quality is better than quantity.  , You will have the opportunity to rebut or question the arguments presented by the other side. Identify potential arguments they may bring up. Many opposing arguments will probably be addressed in your research. Brainstorm different ways to counter these arguments during your rebuttal should the opposing side bring it up.Look to find rebuttals for both the individual parts of their argument in addition to the whole of it. This will fortify your position in the debate. Many times their argument will be the opposite of yours, so while your argument lists the pros, theirs is listing the cons of a particular value. If you pay attention to this, you will be able to not only prove their side of the argument invalid, but also help to further promote your own.  , When you have made a bare bones outline of your case and rebuttals, begin adding a bit more detail that will benefit either essay writing or debating on the subject. Keep the outline form of headers, sections, and bulleted lists, but write in complete sentences, add in helpful questions and evidence, and make your argument more well rounded than just a list of a few words.   Write this more detailed outline as if you were speaking in the debate. This will help you with wording and understand your own argument, and coming up with logical questions and rebuttals for your opponent. Be sure to avoid logical fallacies in your case outline and rebuttal/response. A sound argument will be based on solid evidence that you can back up with if necessary., Often used by beginning debaters in their outlines, the straw man fallacy is when you misrepresent your opponents case by describing it wrongly to the audience. Make sure you don’t do this in your rebuttal, and if your opponent does it to you be sure to call them out on it.   For example, if you’re promoting the abolition of the death penalty, your opponent might commit the straw man by accusing you of lacking sympathy for the families of victims, and that you don’t want true criminals to pay for their crimes.  , When making your outline for your case and rebuttals, it may be easy to refer to using the slippery slope fallacy. This happens when you assume something more extreme will happen on the basis that something less extreme is about to occur.   For example, if you’re arguing for legalizing gay marriage and your opponent says that it is a bad idea, because soon enough we will be legalizing polygamy and bestial relationships in all the states.  , Often used by the losing part of a debate, the ad hominem fallacy is when instead of attacking the merit of a case being presented, the opponent makes personal attacks against the person presenting the case.   For example, if you’ve presented a well worded argument for your case but your opponent has not, at their time for rebuttal they may instead make light of your poor grades or drinking problem. This is unrelated, may or may not be true, and has no effect on the debate.  , When loaded questions are used in debate, they seemingly point to an obvious fault in the argument, when instead they have caught the debater off-guard. Loaded questions are those which have a presumptuous base, so that the person answering the question is forced to defend themselves even if it’s not true.   In a debate about legalizing marijuana, your opponent accuses you of taking drugs by asking, “is it not true that you’re interested in legalizing marijuana because you yourself have done drugs in the past?”  , When someone doesn’t quite know what to say or is trying to avoid saying something that would appear detrimental to their case, they often use ambiguous language. This is where you give unclear explanations and are incredibly vague in your descriptions of things and events.   For example, if you ask your opponent why exactly why we should convert to a socialist system and they say something about how more people will benefit from it, but they aren’t able to supply clear evidence other than emotional reasoning.  , This is one of the most commonly committed fallacies, in which you assume something is correct or good simply because it is of popular belief.   For example, you state in your argument that because most people promote the death penalty, that it is the most effective means of punishment.  , Often used at the end of a debate to highlight the goodness of making a decision in your favor, the false dilemma fallacy occurs when you offer only two final options (black or white) when there may indeed be several other options available.   For example, your opponent states that as a result, the only two options are to legalize all drugs or to outlaw them.  , When presenting to an audience, often it is easier to rely on personal experiences and stories as the basis for an argument rather than finding clear evidence that supports a belief.   For example, your opponent argues that because their friend decided to have their baby instead of having an abortion and ended up happier, all women will feel the same way in a similar position.","['evidence', 'principles', 'form', 'false dilemma fallacy', 'research', 'anecdotes', 'ambiguous language', 'bandwagon fallacy', 'slippery slope', 'ad hominem fallacy', 'potential rebuttals', 'detail', 'outline', 'loaded questions', 'debate', 'straw man', 'case', 'explanations']"

In rural areas, it may be difficult to find someone proficient enough in this martial art to sufficiently guide you. If you live in a highly populated area, you may have to pick a good teacher from among many. The most important part of this process is to find a teacher that works well to motivate your development and who is capable of teaching you advanced skills.   A karate teacher can be called “senpai”, “sensei”, “renshi”, “shihan”, “kyoshi”, or “hanshi”. Senpai is used for anyone who is your senior. Sensei gets used for any teacher. Renshi is a title that is independent of rank, and is commonly used to refer to teachers.Shihan designates an expert teacher, but has little meaning outside of its organizational meaning.Kyoshi is used for a person in the 7th and 8th dan. Hanshi refers to a master teacher, one who instructs instructors. This title means they have attained the 9th or 10th dan. ; , You'll never make it as a karate teacher if you haven't mastered your skill. Anyone can buy a black belt and pretend. It is another thing altogether to earn it. Karate practitioners are considered to be proficient once they've earned a black belt. This is called the 1st dan. It requires a person to be 15 years old and have undergone three years of training.   Kyus are the lower levels in karate. These represent students who have not yet attained the first dan. A person who holds a kyu rank is called a mudansha. Kyu rank color belts start with white and end with brown. Dans are the levels of mastery. There are ten. However, only the first 8 are attainable without recognition from an international governing body (there are many, and they correspond to the style of karate you choose). A person who holds the dan rank is called a yudansha. This is commonly what people mean when they say, “I have a black belt in karate.”, You must continually work to hone your skills. If you do not practice, you will not be very good. No one will want to learn karate from a teacher that performs poorly. By practicing regularly, you make sure your skills are sharp for your students., There are some differences between the major styles of karate, however the major difference is the location where they were practiced. Each one is named after a city. There is no way to determine which style of karate is best for any individual. In order to figure out which one you like best, try them all.   Shuri-te is from Shuri in Okinawa. Naha-te is from Naha in Okinawa. Tomari-te is from Tomari in Okinawa. Shotokan is practiced more commonly on mainland Japan.  , This will earn you notoriety and titles. There are two major components of typical karate exhibitions: kata and kumitejiai. By competing in one or both of these categories, you will enhance your skills and standing within the community. Find out about championships by contacting dojos in your area.Kata means forms, and is an individual demonstration of karate moves. Kumitejiai is a sparring match. In it two practitioners compete for points.  , This can provide you with resources. Seminars and networking, as well as membership information and benefits can aid your quest to become a karate teacher. One downside to many of these organizations is membership fees. However, these are often offset by perks. There are four major styles of karate, each with their own international governing body.   Shotokan is the most common style, with two organizations and nearly 1,000 branches. The Japan Karate Association and Shotokan Karate International are the major groups of this style. Wado Ryu's governing body is the JKF Wado Kai.JKF Shito Kai represents the Shito Ryu style.The international organization for the Goju Ryu style is the International Karate-do Goju Kai.The Kyokushin style is organized through the International Karate Organization and Karate-do Daido Juko., There is no better way to learn how to teach than by learning from another teacher. Apprentice, assist, or student teach under a master you respect. This will help you gain valuable experience working with students, as well as expert advice with any complications or troubles you might encounter. You will have to take initiative and contact these teachers yourself, calling, e-mailing and visiting dojos.  , Before and during your work as a teacher, you will need to develop your skills as a teacher. Teaching draws upon a wide variety of skills, not just combat abilities. You can be the greatest fighter in the history of the world, but if you can't interact well with students, then you won't make a very good teacher.    Learn how to communicate with students of all ages. As a karate teacher, it is likely that you will have students who are children and some adult students as well. When speaking with your young students, you will need to put things into simpler terms to help them understand and try to hold their interest by being a little silly sometimes. With your adult students, you will need to develop a friendly rapport and offer direct, yet considerate feedback to help them learn.  Practice patience when working with students. Most students will try and fail many times before they succeed, so being a teacher requires a lot of patience. Even if you feel frustrated with your students, try not to let it show.  Work on encouraging your students. Students need encouragement to stay motivated enough to stick with karate. Compliment your students when they do a good job and encourage them to keep trying when things get tough.  , An easy way to get into teaching is to work at a dojo that is established. Make contacts in your area to see if any school has an opening or is willing to rent their space for your lessons. By allying yourself with an established dojo, you may be able to draw upon their experience, as well as their established client base.  , You don't need a dojo to teach other people karate. You can give lessons in your home, in your students' homes, or in the park. Place a listing online, in the newspaper, or put up fliers to inform potential students about your classes.  , If you have the financial means, you can open your own dojo. This may take some saving, taking out a loan, or building it yourself. This is a lot of work, but at some point, every successful dojo began with very little and worked their way up.   Be sure to get registered with your local or national karate organizations. Be careful, as this can be a major investment of time and money. Consider your class demographic. For example, if you are not good with children, think about targeting your classes at adults.","['karate teacher', 'offer private lessons', 'karate', 'style', 'championships', 'club', 'industry association', 'ranks', 'dojo', 'master teacher', 'educator']"

It is very important to learn as much as you can about the species of birds that interest you, well before deciding which bird you will choose. The bird must match your lifestyle, interests and ability to take good care of it for the time it lives (which can a very long time for some birds). You must be willing to interact with the bird and provide daily interaction, as well as supervising time outside of the cage, where possible.   Don't buy a bird on impulse. You need the time to research the bird's needs and longevity before bringing one home. Check out books on birds or read online articles on bird species and specific bird requirements, to learn more about the different types of bird species.; , Parrots, cockatiels and cockatoos, or parakeets tend to be some of the most popular types of birds owned as pets. Other good pet species include: Canaries, finches, lovebirds, doves and pigeons. The more exotic or less common the bird type, the more consideration you need to give as to whether it is one you can provide appropriate care for.  , Some birds, such as parrots, live long lives, so this should be a consideration when purchasing a parrot. Arrangements may have to be made to care for parrot after the owner dies; in some cases, you might consider taking on the responsibility of caring for a bird in such a predicament rather than getting a young one.  , Some birds will be able to share housing, while others might not get along; indeed, ""cage mate trauma"" is commonplace and can depend on such issues as personalities, size differences, gender and species.Although it will depend on the species, you might be able to house two boys or two girls or a boy and girl. If they fight, you'll need to separate them. Do plenty of research beforehand and ask questions of the breeder or retailer; you could even talk to bird keepers at your local zoo or wildlife refuge for advice.   There are often special methods needed for introducing a new bird to a cage with an existing bird. Talk to a veterinarian or bird expert for advice.  , The cage required will vary by type of bird; as such, be guided by the species you're choosing. That said, some fairly standard requirements include:   The cage size should be sufficient for the bird to stretch its wings from side to side. For some birds, being able to fly short distances within the cage may be an important part of ensuring it has a healthy living space. At a minimum, large birds should only be housed in a cage that is one and a half times the height of the bird's wingspan (depth, width and height).The cage bars should not be too small; the bird's talons might get caught on or in them if the bar wires or lengths are too small. Equally, the bars should not be so large that the head of the bird could get trapped or the bird could squeeze through and escape. The bigger the space in the cage, the better. Although bird cages that are bigger tend to be harder to clean and are more expensive, if you are not in the house often and/or don't have time to take the bird out for exercise, space in their cage is critical. Small cages tend to lead to behavior problems., A simple rectangle cage is always the best. Circle cages are bad for the bird. There is hardly any space for the bird, and no corners to feel safe in. Moreover, the circle tends to cause the bird to twist its head; the bird can go insane from the constant turning and turning.   Never buy guillotine-styled doors, since they are easier to escape and dangerous if the bird attempts to escape and gets its head caught under the door.  , Never house more than one bird in a small cage. Birds need space to retreat, forage, fly and be apart from other birds, so the more birds being kept, the larger the cage must be. Aviaries (large cages that are akin to small sheds) are more appropriate for keeping several birds at the same time.   If keeping different species of birds, you'll need to be sure that they're compatible when placed together.  , The placement of the cage will be dependent on the climate you live in. If you have severe winters, with temperatures below zero, snow, etc., it is not appropriate to keep the birds outdoors during winter. If you live in a more temperate to warm climate, outdoor aviaries might be more appropriate than an indoor cage. Again, you'll need to research the needs of the individual birds, the temperature requirements and assess these needs against the typical climate in your area.   In some cases, a combination of an indoor/outdoor cage arrangement might provide the optimal housing arrangements for your birds. This could vary between seasons or weather patterns, or it could be a day and night arrangement. Birds in hanging cages can often be transported outdoors to hang under a porch or similar place for daytime fresh air. Always remember to bring the bird back in before cool evening breezes and night air arrive. See the ""Bird hygiene and health"" section below for signs of overheating or chilling in birds. Location of the bird's cage will also be affected by the bird's personality. While a very social bird might love being the center of attention and seeing constant human traffic, a more nervous bird might be happier kept somewhere quieter and away from hustle and bustle (but still being able to interact with the family). Avoid placing a cage in front of a window permanently. The bird will be on the constant lookout for ""enemies"", which can cause it to feel nervous.Putting a cage against a wall can give the bird a break from worrying about predators.  , This makes cleaning much easier, and the papers can be disposed of with ease, then fresh ones placed straight down for the next day's use. Keep a supply handy from your junk mail and newspaper reads.  , This should be a hard-sided carrier, such as a cat cage or a cage recommended by the breeder or store. Secure it well in the car, so that it will not move about during the journey home. A towel can be thrown over the cage to provide privacy but be sure there is adequate air flow for the bird to keep cool and breathe well.  , This also applies when moving the cage to another part of the house if it's still relatively young. Allowing for a settling-in time will help the bird grow accustomed to its environment in its own way, without feeling threatened by looming humans. However, be sure to leave it adequate food and water.  , Some birds thrive on specific types of food only, while other birds may be able to have a more generalized diet. Since precise dietary requirements are dependent on the species, you are advised to do careful reading on this topic in relation to the bird species you're choosing. Some general feeding observations include:   Ensure that you have correct feed for the species of bird. You must find the correct food for your bird, as some birds are picky, while others have very strict dietary requirements. Usually the bag/can of food will have a label telling you which bird it is for. If you don't know what the best food choices are, ask the breeder, the retailer or leave a question on a specialized forum of people who care for this species of bird. You may need to put a bit of grit (sand or small rocks) in a bowl; some passerine birds need this to assist crushing seeds in the crop (chest area). However, not all birds need this grit, and if they eat too much, it can create a blockage.Finches and canaries tend to find a little grit necessary, but don't give it to budgies, cockatiels or parrots.Millet is a treat; never feed too much of it to birds. It is best used as a treat during training. Bird pellets, crumbles or nuggets can be a good way of ensuring adequate nutrition for your bird; since these tend to combine all manner of needed seeds, vegetables, fruits and grains, there is less likelihood of the bird being picky and favoring only one food, thus the bird is more likely to eat a nutritionally balanced diet.Give your feathered friends the same kinds of fresh and healthy fruit and vegetables you enjoy, minus the dressings. This adds greens and variety to their diet. A mixture or variety of foods is both healthy and fun for birds. Feed new seed daily; always empty out the eaten shells the same day too, as this keeps the seed fresh and clean. If the bird you have requires nectar, this is a highly specialized diet and you must learn as much as possible about it before obtaining the bird.  , There are some foods that are not suitable for many species of birds. For example, don't feed the bird any alcohol, chocolate or avocado. Each of these contain chemical components that can be toxic for the bird., There should be a water dish provided; fill this daily with average temperature water. The water feeder should be checked daily to ensure that it is working properly and you must be absolutely sure that the bird knows how to use it. Change water daily to ensure that it is always fresh.   Have fresh dripping water if possible; it prevents fecal matter from ending up in the drinking tray. Dehydration can occur very quickly in birds, within 1 to 2 days without access to water., Water and food cups should be located up high out of the way of any branches above them since birds often drop feces into their food, which isn't sanitary.  , This could be when you eat, or maybe earlier. However, choose a time and try to stick to it, so that the bird knows when to expect its food. If you want to stick to the natural feeding time of birds, feed approximately half an hour after sunrise and just before sunset.During the day, small fruit and vegetable snacks can be left in the cage.   Once again, know your bird. Smaller birds with a higher metabolism may need to be fed more often.  , You can make the eating experience more enjoyable for your bird by making eating time an interactive time too. For example, encourage your bird to eat a piece of food at a time, straight from your hand. Or, encourage your talking bird sing and talk for its food.  , Birds are smart and they need to do enriching things to keep themselves occupied and to stay mentally stimulated.  , Make sure they are bird-safe and that toes or beaks cannot get caught in any parts of the toys.   Items that are are not safe on toys used for birds include: Frayed ropes (could entangle bird feet and beaks); wire (might impale the bird); ""jingle-bell"" type bells (the bird's feet might get stuck in the small cracks).  , Change it up a bit! Birds can get bored with the same toys, day in and day out. Just like us, they enjoy variety and new things. By buying new toys, you increase their enjoyment and reduce the chances of feather plucking and other boredom-stimulated behaviors.   Aim to have differently shaped and textured perches for the bird's feet. Include some wooden perches, and some natural tree branches for variety. This helps ""file"" the bird's beak and nails, so there is less work for you. Just be sure to scrub natural wood thoroughly before use, and do not use any cleaning products because many of these contain ingredients can be toxic to birds.  , This will fulfill the bird's need to move about in search of food. You can also weave food into the bars of the cage, hide food inside a toy or an enrichment device and hang food from the top or sides of the cage. All of these will help to satisfy the bird's foraging instinct and is a form of mental stimulation.  , Regularly hold and pet the bird. The more often this is done, the more excited the bird will be to see you and will likely greet you with whistles, chirps and bird talk. It also makes it easier to get your bird for health checks and for it to be reassured by your presence.  , Daily exercise is recommended for all birds that are tame and can be handled safely. If you have a finch or other bird that is not meant to be handled, this is not an issue. But if you have a bird that you wish to handle, is living in a small cage, or just needs more exercise, be sure to include exercise for the bird on a regular basis. Just remember not to do this in a dangerous room, such as the kitchen, where a hot pot could be on.   Birds don't enjoy being cooped up all day. If you can release the bird from its cage regularly, it will be all the happier for this. This is an absolute must if you want to have a healthy relationship with your bird; birds can suffer a lot being trapped in cages all of the time, considering birds normally fly great distances in their natural environment.  , If your bird gets lots of attention, he or she will be happier as a whole and may even prove more loving and caring as a pet than without the attention. In some cases, a good level of attention can reduce shyness in some species of birds, as familiarity breeds reassurance.   Talk to your bird as it rides around the house with you. This is especially important during the first couple of years together. Birds are fast learners and will surprise you with their range of sound effects. For example, some birds will perfectly mimic the sound of water going down the drain while you wash the dishes, perhaps even mimicking the sound of you rubbing a cleaning rag over the stove, table and counter tops. Some birds can imitate the sound of appliances, such as an electric mixer, when it sees you take it out to make cakes or a smoothie. Play music together. For example, your bird might learn to sing sweetly when you play the piano or other instrument. What a genius your bird is!  , Birds do not need to be cleaned as often as a dog; most likely the bird will clean itself in its water bowl, provided the bowl is large enough for it to use as a bath. Also, birds bathe to keep cool in warmer weather, so be sure to provide water for washing in when the temperature is on the warmer side.In hot weather, put the bird outside, either in its cage or on a perch (only have it out of its cage if its wings are clipped, so that it can't fly away). Squirt the bird with water from a spray bottle. Birds love the cooling sensation. If it's cold outside, you can buy a perch that mounts to your shower wall by suction cups and give the bird a shower indoors. Many birds absolutely love this! Provide a cuttlefish for the bird to scrape its beak against and sharpen.  , A clean cage reduces the changes for bacterial, fungal or viral infections from occurring in your bird. Regular removal of bird droppings is very important for maintaining good bird health. Moreover, a bird living in a clean environment tends to be a more active and happy bird than one living in filth. If this is something you're not prepared to deal with on a daily basis, then a bird is not the right pet for you.   Change the bedding regularly. Remove droppings from perches/toys. Remove uneaten food that has been sitting around on the base of the cage. If your bird is molting (this is common with parrots, for example), there will be a need to vacuum up the molted feathers daily; this tends to occur when there is a warmer spell, or when the temperature goes over 10ºF.Only clean with basic, non-toxic cleaning supplies. Birds are easily poisoned, so find out if a product is safe for birds before using it.  , In some birds, such as parrots, this is essential to prevent serious or fatal flight accidents in the indoor or caged environment.Talk to your veterinarian about this requirement for your bird and find someone qualified to do it, should it need doing. Trimming is aimed at restricting, not preventing flight, and only the primary flight feathers are the subject of a trimming, so the trimmer must know what to do.Toenails may also need trimming, especially on larger adult birds. Usually toenails are not trimmed on baby or small birds, as they need them to stay on the perches, but adult parrots, for example, should be trimmed. Ask your veterinarian to explain how to do this safely, as if you don't know, you can damage the bird and cause bleeding.  , Most birds exhibit similar symptoms for being overheated or too cold and you must attend to fixing either situation as quickly as possible, or there is a risk of the bird dying. The things to watch for include:   An overheated bird: The feet will feel hot to touch, the bird may be panting (a rapid breathing rate), fluttering from the throat, red nares (nasal openings) and hot breath. All of these signs signal an emergency situation and you must contact the vet immediately.A freezing bird: The bird will hunch in, using its feathers to covers its feet and it will fluff out its feathers.Check for drafts, move the bird away from a cold room or area, and place the bird in a warmer spot. Windows can be a source of cold air during the winter months.  , Get your bird checked upon purchase and then regularly afterwards (at least once a year, or as advised by your veterinarian). Should the bird fall ill, this vet will be your first port of call for the best of care.   Do not wait when a bird gets sick. Birds can get even sicker very quickly; the sooner that the vet can see the bird, the better.  , In this way, you can teach it to come out of its cage and be sensible. This will give it much more freedom to enjoy flying around than remaining cooped up inside of its cage all day long. Training is a form of interaction and it plays a vital role in curbing abnormal behaviors.Without training, birds can end up biting, screaming, feather plucking and forming phobias.Hence, this is a very important part of keeping the bird happy and well-adjusted. If the bird is very well trained, then you might even be able to take it into your backyard or someplace else which is outdoors, to give the bird a breath of fresh air, and so that it can get to know the place better. You'll need to be absolutely certain it is willing to return to you though. Never train a bird to perch on your shoulder.This gives it easy access to pecking your eyes and face. Given the bird is at your height, it will be much harder to control.  , Ensure that the room the bird is contained in is safe. This includes closing blinds, rolling up cords, closing toilet seats, ensuring that hot radiators are turned off and checking that open fire places are closed off. (This also goes for simply allowing the bird to fly around in an enclosed space.)   Most birds need outside-of-cage time. This time must always be supervised and the space must always be safe.  , Even then, birds have different personalities, so don't expect it to talk or get used to you quickly. It will learn in its own time. Be ready for a sometimes moody and sometimes fun bird; the bird doesn't see its mood changes as abnormal, but it helps for you to accept that just as with humans, the bird's level of interest in being responsive and interactive varies over time.  , After you've fully trained them both, allow them to interact.  , Find ways to attract birds to the garden, including:   Growing the appropriate food or shelter shrubs and trees in your garden. Ensure there is plenty of shrubbery in your garden. Birds find insects on plants along with shelter and nesting locations. But don't plant too much - some plain grassland can help birds find worms and provides a bit of refreshing open space. Keeping a water pond outside your house or on your balcony for birds to drink water from. Keep a small pot or bowl of water out on the windowsill or porch ledges. These water sources will ensure that the birds have easy access to water. Providing a source of food, such as birdseed containers or hangers. Use seed varieties suited to the local birds. Placing a hummingbird nectar feeder out to attract hummingbirds. Laying out different foods, as different birds warm to different things. Find out which local birds frequent your area and focus on putting out the foods they are known to prefer. Keeping your pets away from all the areas that the birds frequent.  , Even if you haven't provided nesting spaces, and birds are nesting in your yard, you can still be helpful by monitoring their progress and helping if needed. Some things you might like to do help wild birds breed in your yard include:   Put out nest boxes when it's nesting season, in appropriate and safe places. If you find a bird's nest, make sure it is secure, especially if a wind/rainstorm is approaching. If the weather is bad or is going to be bad, it might be a good idea to take the nest down carefully and put in a small box and place it back securely in the same spot it was made. In rough weather, birds' nests can easily fall; if this does happen, it will often kill all the babies.  , This will depend on the bird's age and health:   If you find a baby bird, put it back in the nest if your children removed it. If the baby bird has feathers all over its body, except under its wing, put it near some bushes or other covered area, close to where you found it. Be careful not to put it close to a red ant hill or your neighbor's cat. If the bird is has few or no feathers, try to find the nest to put it back. If you cannot find a nest, call your local wildlife rescue. Many birds are protected species and you require a license to care for them. For example all but three species in Texas are protected. They may instruct you to feed it wet dog food for a day or two until they can pick it up. Beyond that, pet food stores have formulas for baby birds. Many birds put food in the infant's mouth; pigeons are an exception, in that the infants take food out of the parent's mouth. If a baby pigeon is being difficult to feed, find a syringe large enough for the baby to put its beak in after you cut off the front of it. Look online for a home made formula for pigeons; their dietary needs are slightly different. A bird that falls off its perch may have a condition called rickets, due a lack in dietary needs. The wildlife group, internet or a bird breeder may have suggestions.  , If the bird appears to be alive, bring the bird to your house, and place the bird in a container (such as a shoebox, or something similar). Keep the lid off, as you don't want to suffocate the bird. Don't worry about the bird flying away; it is probably in shock and won't move for a while. As a precaution, if the bird does move, close the windows and doors in the room that the bird is in. Call the local animal shelter or humane society, as they probably know how to take care of birds. If you can, take the bird to the shelter/humane society, and they will deal with the rest. If they cannot take care of the bird, keep it around for a few hours and see if it starts responding to you and flying around. If that happens, it has probably recovered and you should let it out into the wild again. The following articles may be of some assistance:   Make baby bird rescue food Care for an injured wild bird that cannot fly Care for a baby bird fallen out of a nest Care for a bird that has hit a window  Rescue a songbird, hawk or owl.   If the bird dies in the hours that you keep it, tough luck; you can't really do much. Take the dead bird outside and leave it somewhere secluded. Don't bury it unless you are sure that it is legal to do so where you live.

"['put your phone away', ""don't miss any classes"", 'make friends with the people sitting near you', 'bring snacks that will increase your concentration and keep you alert', 'force yourself to participate']",How to Survive Summer School2," Keep your phone out of sight. Even if it's just your mom texting what you want for dinner or your friend asking to meet up after class, once you see your screen light up, your concentration is broken.It’s too easy to get lost in Facebook updates and game notifications. Put your phone in your bag and only check it on your breaks.   Even if you just glance at your phone to see your friend’s message, “What are we doing tonight?”, you’re going to start thinking about your plans and miss what your teacher is saying.  , As you know, summer school is a condensed version of a class that is normally a semester or even a year long. Your teacher will be cramming a ton of information into each class—in some cases, missing one day can be equivalent to several days, a week, or even two weeks of school.Your school probably has a policy that if you miss a certain number of days, the course won’t count, and you’ll have wasted your time (and money—they probably won’t refund the cost of the class, either). Make sure you arrive on time to your classes as well. Some schools will count excessive tardies as absences (so being late four times might count as an absence). Too many tardies or absences and you may lose credit for the course.  , If you already know people in your class, that’s great! Otherwise, try introducing yourself to the person sitting next to you and ask to exchange numbers. Now you have someone to contact when you’re confused about homework or due dates, a possible study buddy, and maybe even a friend you’ll keep after school is over.If you make friends in your class, it’s going to make it a little easier to get through the day. You’ll have someone to commiserate with during lunch and an automatic partner on any group work.  , When you’re trying to focus, the last thing you need to be worrying about is hunger pangs or a lack of energy. Bring some “brain food” to class so you can stay focused.   Bring some squares of dark chocolate, which provides energy in the form of caffeine and antioxidants that increase brain function.Walnuts or other foods with omega 3’s improve concentration and help your brain process information.Blueberries can improve your short term memory. Bring these for snack or to eat at lunch.Make sure you stay hydrated, too. Dehydration can affect your concentration and memory and can make you tired and moody, too., It may count toward your grade, for one thing, but participating in class can also make lectures more interesting. If you are participating in class, you must listen and think critically about the material. It will keep you alert and engaged.Studies show that by hearing, seeing, and participating, you are more likely to remember and understand the material than if you are passive.Don’t be afraid of answering incorrectly. It’s better to get something wrong when your teacher can help guide you toward the right answer than getting it wrong on a test. Sit closer to the front and increase the likelihood you will participate and stay engaged. Students who sit in the front of the class tend to be more attentive and answer more questions.","['friends', 'people', 'classes', 'concentration', 'snacks', 'phone']"

That way, even if you have to deliver the baby yourself, help will arrive soon if you experience complications. The dispatcher should also be able to either talk you through the delivery or connect you to someone who can.   If the mother has a doctor or midwife, call that person too. The medical professional can often stay on the phone and help guide you through the process.; , The first stage of labor is called the “latent” stage, where the body is getting ready to deliver by dilating the cervix. It can take a long time, especially if this is the woman's first child.The second, or “active” stage occurs when the cervix has completely dilated.Women may not experience as much pain or discomfort during this stage as later stages. If the woman is fully dilated and you can see the baby's head crowning, she's in stage two. Wash your hands, skip to the next section and get ready to catch the baby. Unless you have been trained to do so, don't try to examine the cervix. Just watch to see if the head begins to appear.  , Time the contractions from the beginning of one to the beginning of the next, and note how long they last. The further along labor is, the more regular, stronger, and closer together contractions become.Here's what you need to know about contractions:   Contractions that are 10 minutes apart or less are a sign that the mother has entered labor.Physicians recommend that you contact the hospital when contractions are 5 minutes apart and last 60 seconds, and this activity has been going for an hour.If this is the case, you probably have time to make it to the hospital if you live close to one. First-time mothers are likely to give birth when contractions are three to five minutes apart and last 40 to 90 seconds, increasing in strength and frequency for at least an hour.If the contractions are two minutes or less apart, buckle down and get ready to deliver the baby, especially if the mother's had other children and they were fast labors. Also, if the mother feels like she's going to have a bowel movement, the baby is probably moving through the birth canal, creating pressure on the rectum, and is on its way out. If the baby is preterm, you should contact the mother's physician and emergency services at any signs of labor.  , Remove any jewelry, such as rings or watches. Wash your hands thoroughly with antimicrobial soap and warm water. Scrub your arms all the way up to your elbows. If you have the time, wash your hands for five minutes; if you don’t have time for that, wash them thoroughly for at least one minute.Remember to scrub in between your fingers and under your nails. Use a nail brush or even a toothbrush to clean under your nails.Wear sterile gloves if available. Don’t wear things like dishwashing gloves, which are likely loaded with bacteria. To finish (or if you don't have access to soap and water), use an alcohol-based hand sanitizing product or rubbing alcohol to kill off any bacteria and viruses that may have been on your skin. This helps prevent giving the mother or the baby an infection.  , Get set up so that you have everything you'll need within easy reach, and so the mother is as comfortable as possible. There will be a mess afterwards, so you may want to have the birthing area somewhere you don't mind getting messy.Collect clean towels and clean sheets. If you have clean waterproof tablecloths or a clean vinyl shower curtain, these are excellent at preventing blood and other fluids from staining furniture or carpeting. In a pinch, you can use newspapers, but they are not as sanitary. Get a blanket or something warm and soft to wrap the baby in. The infant must be kept warm once it’s delivered. Find a few pillows. You might need them to prop up the mother as she's pushing. Cover them with clean sheets or towels. Fill a clean bowl with warm water, and get a pair of scissors, a few lengths of string, rubbing alcohol, cotton balls, and a bulb syringe. You may find that sanitary napkins or paper towels are helpful to stop the bleeding later. Get a bucket in case the mother feels nauseated or the need to vomit. You may also want to get a glass of water for the mother. Labor is hard work.  , She may feel panicky, rushed, or embarrassed. Do your best to remain calm and reassuring to help her relax.   Ask the mother to undress from the waist down. Provide her with a clean sheet or towel to cover up, if she'd like. Encourage her to breathe. Avoid hyperventilation by speaking in a low, soothing voice and verbally directing her breathing. Encourage her to inhale through her nose and out through her mouth in an even, rhythmic manner. If you're still having trouble, hold her hand and take deep, slow breaths along with her.Reassure her. This is probably not the birthing experience she had in mind, and she might be worried about potential complications. Tell her help is on the way, and you'll do the best you can in the meantime. Remind her that people have given birth outside of hospitals for thousands of years, and it's more than possible to come through it safely. Validate her. The mother may feel scared, angry, giddy, or any combination of those feelings. Validate whatever she is feeling. Don’t try to correct her or argue with her., She might want to walk around or crouch down during this stage of labor, especially when a contraction hits. As she starts to transition to the second phase, she might want to settle into a position to give birth or cycle through a few different ones. Switching between positions may help the labor progress more smoothly, but let her decide what’s working for her body.Here are four standard positions, and the pros and cons of each:Squatting. This puts gravity to the mother's advantage, and can open the birth canal 20%-30% more than other positions. If you suspect the baby is breech (emerging feet-first), suggest this position as it gives the baby room to rotate. You can help the mother in this position by kneeling behind her and supporting her back.All-fours: This position is gravity-neutral and can ease back pain, and the mother might instinctively choose it. It can provide pain relief if the mother has hemorrhoids. Position yourself behind her if that's the case.Side-lying: This leads to a slower descent through the birth canal, but can lead to a more gentle stretching of the perineum and may reduce tearing.Have the mother lie on her side, with her knees bent, and lift the top leg. She might also need to prop herself up on an elbow. Lithotomy position (lying back). This is the most common position used in hospitals, with the woman lying flat on her back and her legs bent at the knee. It allows maximum access for the caregiver, but it puts a lot of pressure on the mother's back and is not considered ideal.It also may make contractions slower and more painful.If she seems to prefer this position, try putting a few pillows under her back to ease the pain.  , Don't encourage her to push until she feels an unstoppable pressure to do so — you don't want to waste her energy and make her exhausted too early. When women are ready to push, they may feel increased pressure near their lower back, perineum, or rectum. It may even feel to her as though she is ready to have a bowel movement.When she is ready, though, you can help guide her through the pushing.   Ask the mother to curl forward and tuck her chin. This curved position will help the baby through the pelvis.When pushing, it can be helpful if the mother holds her knees or legs with her hands and pulls her legs back. The area around the vagina will bulge out until you see the top of the baby's head (crowning). As soon as the baby crowns, it's time for the mother to push in earnest. Encourage her to focus her abdominal muscles to push down, as you might do when you’re trying to urinate faster or have a bowel movement. This can help avoid straining or directing the pushing force upward toward the neck and face.Three to four pushes, lasting 6-8 seconds each, are considered appropriate per contraction. However, it is important to encourage the mother to do whatever comes naturally to her.Keep encouraging deep, slow breathing. Pain can be controlled to different extents through mental relaxation and by concentrating on deep breathing instead of panicking or being distracted by everything that is going on. Different people have different levels of mental control, but deep, slow breathing is always a benefit during childbirth.Understand that the woman may urinate or have a bowel movement during labor. This is normal and is not a cause for concern. Don’t even bother mentioning it -- you don’t want to embarrass the mother., This step isn't complicated, but it's important. Pay extra attention to these tips:    Do not pull on the baby's head or the umbilical cord. This can cause nerve damage.If the cord is wrapped around the baby's neck, which is fairly common, gently lift it over the baby's head or carefully loosen it so the baby can slip through the loop. Do not pull on the cord. It’s natural -- and in fact desirable -- for the baby to pass through the pelvis face-down. If the baby’s face is facing toward the mother’s back, don’t worry. This is actually the best position for delivery.If instead of the head emerging you see the feet or buttocks coming first, you have a breech birth. See instructions for that situation below.  , When the baby's head rotates to one side (which it will probably do on its own), be prepared for the body to come out with the next push.   If the baby's head does not rotate to one side, ask the mother to push again. The baby will likely rotate spontaneously. If the baby's head doesn't rotate without help, gently turn it to one side. This should help a shoulder emerge with the next push. Don't push it if you feel any resistance. Deliver the other shoulder. Gently lift the body toward the mother's stomach to help the other shoulder come through. The rest of the body should follow quickly. Keep supporting the head. The body will be slippery. Make sure you're still providing enough support for the baby's neck, which isn't strong enough to support the head on its own., Hopefully, all goes well and you've successfully delivered a healthy baby by now. If the delivery seems stalled, though, here's what you can do:   If the head comes out and the rest of the body doesn't come out after she pushes three times, have the mother lie on her back. Instruct her to grab her knees and pull her thighs toward her stomach and chest. This is called the McRoberts position, and it's very effective at helping push the baby out.Have her push hard with each contraction. Never push on a mother's abdomen to try to help deliver a stuck baby. If the feet come out first, see the section on breech birth below. If the baby is still stuck and paramedics are still nowhere near the scene, you could try to guide the baby's head gently downward toward the mother's rectum. This should only be attempted as a last resort, and should not be attempted at all if medical attention will be arriving soon.  , Hold the delivered baby with two hands, one supporting its neck and head. Tilt the head down at about a 45-degree angle to allow the fluids to drain. The feet should be slightly above the head (but don't hold the baby by the feet).   You can also wipe any mucus or amniotic fluid from the nose and mouth area with clean, sterile gauze or cloth., Ensure full-skin contact, and cover them both with clean towels or blankets. The skin-to-skin contact encourages a hormone called oxytocin, which will help the mother deliver the placenta.Position the baby so that it's head is still slightly lower than the rest of the body, so fluids can keep draining. If the mother is lying down and the baby's head is on her shoulder and its body is on her breast, this should happen naturally., It should be crying slightly. If it's not, you can take a few steps to help make sure the airway is clear.   Rub the body. Physical touch will help the baby breathe. Rub over it's back firmly with a blanket while it's still on its mother's chest. If that's not helping, turn the baby so that it's facing the ceiling, tilt the head back to straighten the airway, and keep rubbing the body. It might not cry, but doing this ensures that the baby gets the air it needs.Rubbing vigorously with a clean towel can also help stimulate the baby to breathe. Manually clear fluids. If the baby gags or turns blue, wipe fluids out of the mouth and nose with a clean blanket or cloth. If that doesn't do the trick, squeeze the air out of a bulb syringe, put the tip in the nose or mouth, and release the bulb to suck the fluid into the bulb. Repeat until all the fluid is cleared, emptying the bulb between uses. If you don't have a bulb, you can use a drinking straw. If nothing else has worked, try flicking the soles of the baby's feet with your fingers, or gently popping its bottom. Don't slap the baby.If none of this helps, perform infant CPR.  , If it happens, a breech birth is a circumstance where the feet or buttocks enter the pelvis first instead of the head coming out., Have her sit at the edge of a bed or other surface and pull her legs to her chest. As a precaution, put down pillows or blankets where the baby is likely to fall.  , You'll see its back and bottom hang down and you'll want to grab it, but don't. You want to avoid touching the baby until the head is delivered because your touch could stimulate the baby to gasp while the head is still submerged in amniotic fluid.Try to make sure the room is warm, as a drop in temperature could also cause the baby to gasp., Once the head is delivered, grab the baby under the arms and bring it up to the mother. If the head doesn't come out in the push after the arms come out, have the mother squat and push.  , Delivering the placenta is the third stage of labor. It will arrive anywhere between a few minutes to an hour after the baby is delivered.The mother will probably feel an urge to push after a few minutes; this is helpful.Put a bowl close to the vagina. Right before it emerges, blood will come out of the vagina and the cord will get longer. Have the mother sit up and push the placenta into the bowl. Rub the mother's stomach below her belly button firmly to help slow down the bleeding. It might hurt her, but it's necessary. Keep rubbing until the uterus feels like a large grapefruit in the lower belly., If the cord isn't stretched too tightly by doing so, encourage the mother to breastfeed as soon as possible. This will help stimulate a contraction and encourage the delivery of the placenta. It may also help slow bleeding.If breastfeeding isn't an option, stimulating the nipples can also help stimulate delivering the placenta., As the placenta is delivering, don't tug on the cord to hurry it along. Let it come out on its own as the mother pushes. Pulling on it could cause severe damage., Once the placenta is out, place it in a trash bag or a container with a lid. When and if the mother goes to a hospital, the doctor might want to inspect the placenta for any abnormalities.  , You should only cut the umbilical cord if professional medical attention is hours away.Otherwise, leave it alone and just make sure it's not pulled tight.If you do need to cut the cord, first feel the cord gently for a pulse. After about ten minutes, the cord will stop pulsing because the placenta has separated. Don't cut it before then.Don't worry about pain. There are no nerve endings in an umbilical cord; neither mother nor child will feel pain when its cut. The cord will, however, be slippery and difficult to handle.Tie a string or lace around the cord, about three inches from the baby's belly button. Tie it tightly with a double knot. Tie another lace about two inches away from the first one, again using a double knot. Using a sterile knife or scissors (that have been boiled in water for 20 minutes or wiped down with rubbing alcohol), cut between the two laces. Don't be surprised if it's rubbery and tough to cut; just take your time. Cover the baby again when the cord is cut.  , Cover them both in blankets, and encourage the mother to keep the baby on her chest. Replace any wet or dirty bedding, and move them to a clean, dry area.   Control pain. Put an ice pack on the mother's vagina for the first 24 hours to ease soreness and pain. Offer her acetaminophen/paracetamol or ibuprofen if she's not allergic. Give the mother something light to eat and a drink. Avoid carbonated drinks and fatty or sugary foods, as these could cause nausea. Toast, crackers, or light sandwiches are good options. The mother may want to rehydrate with an electrolyte-containing sports drink.Put a diaper on the baby. Make sure it's below the umbilical cord. If the cut cord smells bad (signaling an infection) clean it with alcohol until it doesn't smell anymore. If you have a small hat available, put it on the baby so it doesn’t catch a chill.  , Sometimes, unexpected deliveries can cause hemorrhaging after delivery. It occurs in up to 18% of all deliveries. To help prevent this, you can firmly massage the uterus. If you see significant blood flow after the placenta is delivered, do the following:Place one (clean) hand inside the vagina. Place your other hand low on the mother's abdomen. Push down with the hand placed on the abdomen as you push against the uterus from the inside with the other hand.You can also make firm, repetitive squeezing movements with on hand on the mother's lower abdomen without placing a hand inside the vagina., Instruct and if necessary help the mother pour warm water over the vagina every time she urinates in order to keep the area clean. You can use a clean squeeze bottle to do this.If she needs to have a bowel movement, have her place a clean pad or washcloth against her vagina while she pushes. Help the mother urinate. It is good for her to empty her bladder, but due to blood loss, it may be best to have her urinate in a pan or on a cloth you can move from under her so she does not have to get up.  , Once delivery is complete, proceed to the nearest hospital or await the ambulance you called.

The red section, ""The thief,"" is the subject of the sentence, or the one doing the action. The purple section, ""smashed,"" is the verb, or action. The blue section, ""the window,"" is the object: something is happening to it. Keep reading for more explanation, and look back at this example sentence to follow along.  , In an active sentence, the subject is whatever does something. It can be a person, a place, a thing, or even an idea. Here are some examples, with the subject in red:   Every morning, the sun rises.  The tall woman will brush her teeth.  Your bravery saved the town.  , In active sentences, the verb describes what the subject does. It can also describe what the subject did in the past, or will do in the future. Here are some examples, with the verb colored purple:   The tree grew very tall. My enemy is planning his attack.  , In many active sentence, but not all of them, an action is done to something else. Here are examples, with the object colored blue:   The dog ate the meat. The explorers discovered a new river.  , If you're not sure whether something is the subject or object, find yourself the verb and ask yourself ""What is (verb)-ing?"" to find the subject.Ask ""What is being (verb)ed?"" to find the object. Here's an example of a tricky sentence, step by step:   ""Everything in the world irritates her."" Find the verb. The only word that describes an action is ""irritates"", so ""irritates"" must be the verb. Find the subject. What is irritating? ""Everything in the world"" is irritating, so the entire phrase ""Everything in the world"" is the subject. Find the object. What is being irritated? The person described as ""her"" is being irritated, so ""her"" is the object.  , ""The ball is thrown by the athlete."" In this passive sentence, the subject is ""The ball"". The verb, ""was thrown"", describes what happened to the ball. The agent, the thing that did the action, is ""the athlete""., The subject of a passive sentence is having something done to it. This can be any noun: a person, place, thing, or idea. Here are some examples, with the subject written in red:    This essay was written last year.  The delicious dinner was cooked by a professional cook.  Elephants are protected from hunters by international law.  , In a passive sentence, something happens to the subject. The verb is the action that happens. It begins with a ""to be"" verb (for example, ""is,"" ""was,"" ""were,"" ""has been,"" ""will have been""), then a verb in a past tense.Here are some examples with the verb colored purple:   The city was destroyed by the meteor. All the ice cream had been eaten already. The music was played beautifully.  , Many passive sentences do not include the agent at all. If an agent is present, it describes what did the action. It usually comes at the end of the sentence, after the word ""by."" Here are some examples, with the agent colored brown:   The child was raised by her mother. World War I was started by an assassin.  , Remember, a passive sentence is about a subject that something is happening to. Find the verb and ask ""What (verb)?"" to find the subject. To find the agent, if there is one in the sentence, rephrase the sentence to ask ""Who is (verb)ing? Here's a difficult example, step by step:   ""None of them had been so badly treated by their own teacher before."" Find the passive verb. This sentence might sound confusing, because the writer has added some adverbs in the middle of the verb! The full verb is ""had been (...) treated"". If it makes the sentence easier to follow, you can treat the verb as ""had been so badly treated."" Find the subject. What had been so badly treated? None of them had been so badly treated. ""None of them"" is the subject of the sentence. Find the agent. Who had treated ""none of them"" so badly before? Their own teacher had treated ""none of them"" so badly before. ""Their own teacher"" is the agent of the passive sentence.  , Passive verbs include a form of ""to be"" as well as a past tense verb. For example, ""was bitten"" or ""been blessed."" This is one of the easiest ways to tell a passive sentence apart, but the next step is also useful for figuring out difficult sentences, and becoming familiar with how passive and active sentences work.  , Read the sentence, think about what it means, and try to describe the topic as an active sentence: ""someone that did something."" If the order of words is the same as the original sentence, the sentence is active. If you had to change the order, the sentence is probably passive. Here are some examples:   ""The flower bloomed every night."" This sentence is about ""a flower that bloomed."" You didn't have to change the sentence to say that, so it's an active sentence. ""The river was crossed by the oxen. This sentence is about ""oxen that crossed a river."" You had to change the order of the nouns (river and oxen), so the original sentence is passive. ""The book was written two hundred years ago."" This sentence is about ""Someone that wrote a book."" You had to add a whole new noun (someone) to guess at who did the writing! The original sentence is definitely passive.  , For example, ""This cave painting was created thousands of years ago."" is a good passive sentence. It focuses the attention right on what you want to talk about, the cave painting. The active version of this sentence ""Someone created this cave painting thousands of years ago,"" adds unnecessary words (someone) and makes the topic of the sentence (""this cave painting"") harder to find. Here are additional examples:   ""I can't text right now. My phone is being repaired."" is more useful than ""I can't text right now. The electronics store staff is repairing my phone."" ""Our son Robert was delivered at County Hospital last night!"" tells your family the news it wants to hear right away. ""The doctors at County Hospital delivered our son Robert last night!"" puts the focus on the doctors, whom Uncle Joe probably doesn't care about.  , If someone did something embarrassing, you can use a passive verb to avoid calling attention to him.For example, say ""The lamp was broken."" instead of ""John broke the lamp"" if you want to tell everyone that you need a new lamp, without making John feel bad. (Even the active sentence ""Someone broke the lamp"" may start an argument over who did it.)   This use comes up often in politics and news announcements. Keep an eye out for a celebrity, politician, or company spokesman that says ""Mistakes were made."" so they can avoid admitting that ""I made mistakes."", In most cases, an active verb makes a sentence more forceful and easier to follow. When you write a passive sentence, stop and try to rewrite it as an active sentence. It's not always necessary, but it often forces you to improve your writing and think harder about what you're trying to say.For example:   ""Slaves were treated badly in the early US."" can be rewritten as ""___ treated slaves badly in the early US."" Depending on your point, you might use the subject ""slave owners,"" ""the judicial system,"" or one of many other nouns. ""Cancer has been called the most dangerous threat to senior citizens."" makes a claim without referring to a source. Rewrite this as ""___ calls cancer the most dangerous threat to senior citizens."" If you are not sure what the subject of this new active sentence is, you might not have enough evidence to make this claim.

This can help you figure if your cat needs to see your vet or if there may be another issue. Signs your kitten may have a broken leg include:   Reluctance to put weight on the leg Limping Swelling Pain or tenderness Limb deformity or unusual bends in the leg Rapid breathing Broken skin and/ or a visible boneNot eating or grooming Crying, howling, moaning, or growling; , No matter how sweet your kitten is, it may bite or scratch you because of the injury. Take great care when examining your kitten’s leg to minimize the risk of biting or scratching.Maintain a safe distance between the kitten’s mouth and your face. Avoid attempting to hug it. Examine the leg slowly, carefully, and as gently as possible. Reassure your kitten in a soft voice. Stop looking for signs if your kitten becomes agitated.  , Once you’ve checked your kitten’s leg, call your vet’s office. Explain to the office staff that your kitten may have a broken leg to get an appointment as soon as possible. If your vet isn’t available, take your kitten to an emergency clinic to ensure it gets prompt care.Calling ahead can also alert the vet that you are coming so they can prepare to treat your kitten as quickly as possible.   Give as much information as possible about your kitten’s symptoms. Ask any questions you have, such as what type of first aid to provide and the best way to transport kitten to the office.  , Before you take your kitten to the vet, stabilize its leg with a splint or bandage. This can reduce the risk of further injury or pain. Only stabilize the leg if your kitten allows it.Place a towel or blanket gently over your kitten’s head to prevent it from biting. Make a splint with items such as the cardboard center of paper towel or toilet rolls, rolled up newspaper, or towels.Put the splint next to the broken area. Use a bandage, pantyhose, or surgical tape to keep the splint in place. Add padding around the splint to reduce your kitten’s discomfort. Avoid pushing any exposed bone back through the broken skin. In this case, place some sterile gauze or a sanitary napkin over the area and then splint it.  , The only way to safely treat a kitten’s broken leg is with veterinary care. After you’ve stabilized the leg and informed the vet that you are coming, take your kitten to the office for treatment.Wrap your kitten in a thick towel or place it on a rigid surface for the car ride.This can minimize your kitten’s discomfort the risk of further injury.Place your kitten in a crate, carrier, or open box to keep it from moving around the car. Put it in the back passenger side seat so that you can watch your kitten through your rearview mirror. Use a seat belt around the front of the crate or carrier to secure it., You’ll need to seek prompt veterinary care if your kitten’s leg is broken. Veterinary care is the only way to confirm a broken leg. It also ensures that your kitten gets proper treatment to heal the leg.Let the vet know any symptoms your kitten has and how the injury occurred. For example, say, “Snowball has been limping for a couple of days. I’m not sure how she got hurt. She limps and holds her right leg up when she walks.”Answer any questions your vet may have about the injury or your kitten.  , Your vet will perform an examination of your kitten. This may include further testing such as X-rays. The exam and tests help the vet figure out exactly where the break is and develop the best treatment plan.Recognize that the vet may touch or press certain points of your kitten’s leg to feel if they’re swollen, sore, warm, or out of place. The vet may also place your kitten on the ground to see it walk. Your kitten may also undergo an X-ray or have an ultrasound or MRI to detect internal damage.  , Your vet will suggest a course of treatment for your kitten’s broken leg. The type of treatment will depend on the break’s severity and your kitten’s overall health. Follow any instructions your vet provides for the kitten’s treatment, including giving your kitten antibiotics. Your vet may consider treating your kitten with:A cast or splint Surgery, especially if the surrounding tissue is damaged Amputation for very severe breaks  , Simple breaks in one spot on your kitten’s leg or breaks that haven’t torn tissue often require immobilization with a cast or splint.Most immobilization treatments take 4-6 weeks to heal.Observe if the vet uses a rigid cast or more secure splint on your kitten’s leg.Casts are constructed with plaster and splints may be plastic, plaster or aluminum. Ask your vet if extra padding can make your kitten more comfortable. Put a sling around the leg for up to 10 days if your kitten’s vet prescribes it. This can keep your kitten from moving and walking. Avoid getting the cast or splint wet to allow the break to heal. Leave any casts or splints in place until the vet removes them.  , If your kitten has a very severe break, your vet may suggest surgery. This can stabilize the bone, joints, and surrounding tissues, which will help your kitten heal properly. In especially severe breaks, amputation may be necessary.Authorize any recommended pre-surgical tests to make sure your kitten is healthy enough for surgery. Ask the vet what type of surgery is best for your kitten. It may be using pins, wires, or screws to stabilize the leg. It may also be amputation. Follow any post-operative instructions from the vet. This includes restricting activity for 2-4 weeks, a course of antibiotics or pain medication, and having pins and screws removed.  , A broken leg can be very traumatic for your kitten. Give your kitten as much rest as possible while it is injured. Rest aids healing and minimizes pain or discomfort.Restrict your kitten’s movement, especially jumping, as much as possible.  , One way to help restrict movement and comfort your kitten is creating one area in which to sleep, eat, and use the litter box. It can be an entire room or in a crate. This can ensure your kitten doesn’t need to move often and doesn’t waste energy that is better spent on healing.Place a warm blanket in the area, which can provide warmth and comfort to your kitten. Consider putting it in a space that allows you to lay down with your kitten. This can give your kitten extra comfort. Make sure your kitten has clean food and water in the area. Your kitten may not want to eat or drink much until it starts feeling better. Put a small litter box or bathroom pad in the area. Take your kitten to it every hour so that it doesn’t have to put any weight on the leg.  , Your kitten may be scared or cry because of the break or treatment. Pick up your kitten or sit by the blanket and gently pet it. This can calm your kitten and provide reassurance.Stroke your kitten’s head, neck, and under the chin. Avoid the broken leg and any spots that are sensitive. Your kitten may also not want to be pet. If this is the case, give it some space until it is ready for contact again.  , In addition to touch, talking can also provide your kitten comfort and reassurance. Any you’re your are with your kitten or checking in on it, give a few comforting words.Maintain a soft voice so you don’t scare your kitten. Include your kitten’s name and offer praise while you talk. For example, “I know you’re hurting and scared, Sam? You’re being such a good kitten.” Consider gently stroking your kitten when you talk to it.

If it's soaking wet, you'll just end up damaging your hair and the curling process won't work. It can be just a little bit damp as well.       ; , You need an ordinary duel-sided flat iron to curl your hair. A 1 inch (2.5 cm) iron will be perfect for the job. Just give it a minute or two to fully heat up. If it has settings, pick a setting in the middle so the iron curls your hair the right amount -- if the setting is too high, your curls may end up looking a little bit dented.  , Sectioning your hair can help you isolate parts of your hair. This can make it a bit easier to curl your hair, especially if there's a lot of it, but it can take longer. If you're sectioning your hair, you'll need to clip or pin back the top part of your hair so you can reach the bottom strands first. If you're not, then you can start with any of your strands. As you curl more hair, you'll be sectioning less and less of it.  , You can start about 3-4 inches (7.6-10.1 cm) down your hair. If you curl it from the very top, your hair will look too poofy.  , Once the hair is in your iron, just fold it backward, away from your face, and hold the position for a few seconds.         , Now, either glide the iron down your hair or just release it and move it down 2-3 inches (5 - 7.6 cm) before you fold it forward, in the opposite direction that you folded it the last time.         , Continue moving the iron down and moving it forward and backward until you approach the bottom of the strand. You can leave a 2-3 inches (5 - 7.6 cm) of hair untouched at the bottom to create a natural and flowing look.         , Just repeat this process on all of the 1-2 inch (2.5 - 5 cm) strands of your hair until you've created beach waves on all of the strands. If you've sectioned off your hair with a clip or tie, just take more chunks of hair out of the clip until they're all down.          To avoid having all of your curls clump together, you can alternate between starting by moving the iron forward first and backward first as you make your way along the strands. That way, each strand will be curled in the opposite direction. You also don't have to start curling each strand in the exact same place. When you reach the outer parts of your hair, you can clip the top part of the hair you're not ironing to the side -- so if you're curling the top-most right strand, you can clip the top left strands to the side of your head so they don't get in the way.  , Look at the sides of your head and put up a mirror to the back of your head to make sure that you've evenly curled your hair. If one side is a lot curlier than the other, just try to make some more beach waves on the other side for balance.  , This will help you preserve the beach waves for longer.

Mix the two together well to form a paste.It helps to mix the baking soda with warm water so the two blend more easily together.; , Once you’ve mixed up the baking soda paste, use clean hands or a rag to carefully apply it to the grill grate. Make sure to cover the entire surface, paying special attention to the dirtiest spots, and let the paste sit on the grate for at least 20 minutes.It’s best to remove the grate from the grill before you apply the paste. That will allow you to cover both sides so you don’t miss any spots.  , If you haven’t cleaned your stainless steel grate in a while, it may need a more intense cleanser to freshen it. Apply a generous coat of oven cleaner spray over both sides of the grate. Place the grate inside a plastic garbage bag, and allow it to sit overnight.You can use the oven cleaner if the baking soda paste doesn't work. It's not necessary to do both unless your grate is extremely dirty and the baking soda leaves residue behind. Any oven cleaner will work to clean the grate, but you may want to choose a cleanser that is designed for use on both ovens and grills.  , After you’ve let the baking soda paste or the oven cleaner sit on the grate for the designated time, use a wire grill brush designed for stainless steel to scrub the entire surface. Make sure to run the brush between and along the sides of the grate to remove all of the cooked-on residue.Check your grill brush to make sure that it’s in good condition before using it. There shouldn’t be any bristles coming out.  , Once you’ve given the grate a good scrubbing with the brush, use your garden hose to spray it down with warm water. Make sure to remove all of the cleanser and dirt residue, and then dry the grate with a clean towel. Return it to the grill so you’re ready for the next barbecue.If the grill grate is particularly dirty, you may need to repeat the cleaning process more than once to fully remove all of the dirt and food residue.  , When your stainless steel grill grate is clean, you’ll want to keep it that way. Allow the grill to cool down for 5 to 10 minutes after using it, but while it’s still warm, use your grill brush to scrub the grate down to remove any food debris.To limit residue on the grate, always preheat your grill before placing food on it. That will help keep items from sticking to the grate. Be sure to oil your food before placing it on the grate to help keep anything from sticking to the surface.  , The flame tamers sit directly on top of the burners to form a barrier between the burners and the grate. Food debris can sometimes build up on the tamers, so you should remove them and use a small, dry wire brush to remove any residue. Wipe them down with a clean piece of paper towel afterward.Make sure that your grill is cool and not turned on before cleaning any of the interior components. If you’re not sure where the flame tamers are in your grill, consult the owner’s manual. They are also sometimes known as heat tents or vaporizer bars.  , When you take out the flame tamers, the burners will be underneath. Food buildup on the burners can led to uneven heating and burner failure. Clean tube, flat, u-shape, and cast burners with a small, dry wire brush, paying special attention to the burner port area where the gas comes out.If you have ceramic burners, don’t clean them with a brush. Turn the grill on for 10 minutes to burn off any food residue, and once the grill is turned off and cool, use tweezers to remove large food debris. If you’re not sure what type of burners your grill has, consult the owner’s manual.  , The venturi tubes supply the gas to the burners, and can easily get dirty. Remove the entire burner assembly according to the instructions in the owner’s manual, and rub it and the tubes down with a cloth dampened with soapy water. Run a clean, damp cloth over the tube to rinse it.The venturi tubes are narrow tubes that have a series of small holes along the sides and/or ends. They may be curved and connected to the the burner assembly, or they may be straight and easy to detach from the burner assembly. Consult your owner's manual to see exactly what your grill's venturi tubes look like and where to locate them.  , Clogs in the venturi tube can cause your grill not to work properly, but it’s easy for insects and other debris to build up inside. Use a small wire brush to clean the holes on the tube to ensure that there aren’t any clogs before replacing the tube and burner assembly.Consult the owner’s manual to determine the proper way to put the tube and assembly back. Your grill won’t work properly if it isn’t in place, and it can be very dangerous to lit the grill. A paperclip or small piece of wire works well to clean the holes in the tube too. You may want to run water from your garden hose through the tube to determine if there are any clogs.  , It’s best not to use stainless steel cleaners or polishes on the grill because they’re not designed to be used on surfaces that get very hot. Instead, fill a bucket with warm water and add some liquid dish detergent to create a warm, soapy solution.Never use an acidic or abrasive cleanser on stainless steel. They will damage the finish.  , Dampen a microfiber cleaning cloth with the soapy solution that you mixed. Run it over the entire surface of the grill’s exterior, making sure to rub with the grain of the stainless steel to avoid scratching it.Be sure to use a microfiber cloth to wash the stainless steel exterior. Other fabrics may scratch the finish.  , If there are stubborn areas where dirt is stuck on, wet a sponge in the soapy solution. Rub it over the areas, but be sure to move in the direction of the grain to prevent scratches in the stainless steel.While a soft sponge is fine to use on a stainless steel grill, don’t use a scouring pad or steel wool. They will scratch the surface.  , When you’ve finished cleaning the exterior of the grill, spray it down with your garden hose. Make sure to use warm water, though, to get all of the soapy residue off the stainless steel., After you’ve rinsed off all the dirt and soapy, wipe down the grill with a towel to dry it. Use a microfiber cloth, though, and move in the direction of the grain for the best finish.When the grill is dry, you may want to follow up with stainless steel cleaner wipe to give it a more polished appearance.

"['engage more with your coworkers', 'maintain a positive attitude for your students', 'note the impact you are having on your students', 'try to keep an open mind when you are criticized', 'find sources of inspiration', 'avoid negative discussions about teaching']",How to Love Teaching2," Having a positive work environment can also make a big difference in the way that you feel about your job. If you are not too close with your coworkers, then you might consider spending more time getting to know them. Some things you can do to get to know your coworkers better include:Attending social functions, such as meeting up with other teachers for happy hour or going to a barbeque at someone’s house. Eating lunch with other teachers in the teacher’s lounge instead of alone in your classroom. Asking other teachers questions about their lives, interests, and teaching.  , Your students will look to you each day to set the tone in the classroom. One way to help keep your students in good spirits is to set a positive tone for the class every day. Some things you can try include:Putting an inspirational quote on the board. Telling a joke for the day. Greeting each of your students with a smile when he or she enters your class in the morning.  , Sometimes you might feel like you are not making a difference, which may get you feeling down about teaching. To help yourself stay positive, try making a list of all of the ways that you are having an impact on your students’ lives. Some things that you might list include:Being a source of encouragement for a child whose parents rarely provide any encouragement. Teaching vital skills to students that will help them to find jobs and succeed in life. Providing a positive, safe space where students can share honestly and be themselves., All teachers have to be evaluated throughout their careers. These evaluations are meant to help you find ways to improve and be the best teacher you can be. Try to stay open minded when you are criticized or advised to change something about your teaching.Even if you are an experienced teacher, try to use your evaluations as opportunities to broaden your knowledge and become even more experienced. For example, if you are criticized for going too quickly when you lecture about something, then you might look into ways to pace yourself better keeping in mind that this will benefit your students.  , If you are down on your job, then you might also find it helpful to seek out daily sources of inspiration. Try setting aside 10 to 15 minutes every day before you start your day to get inspired.For example, you might read an inspirational quote every morning, journal about someone you admire and whose behavior you would like to model through your teaching, or just watch a video online that inspires you.  , While it is fine to want to vent now and then, if you find that you are surrounded by negative discussions of teaching, then this could be wearing on you.To stay positive about your job, it is important to focus on the positives and avoid conversations that are just about criticizing your profession.   If a conversation becomes negative, then try changing the subject. Try saying something like, “Yeah, that sucks. Oh, I just remembered. Did you see the local news last night? There was a really cool story about one of our students!” If a coworker is always complaining or talking negatively about teaching, then you might want to try to distance yourself from him or her. Try eating lunch with a different group or go for a walk on your lunch breaks instead.

"['look for changes on the skin of your palms', 'assess the function of your fingers', 'identify any risk factors you may have', 'prepare for your appointment', 'allow your doctor to inspect and test your hand', 'do a tabletop test', 'assess how the condition is progressing', 'try steroid injections', 'get enzyme injections', 'discuss the option of surgery with your doctor', 'use stretching in combination with other treatments']",How to Diagnose Dupuytren's Contracture," The first sign of Dupuytren's contracture is a change to the skin on your palms. It will cause lumps and pits to develop on the surface of the hand. These lumps and pits are tough areas and they usually form very gradually.This condition commonly affects both hands but may be more severe in one or the other.; , As the condition progresses it will impact your ability to straighten out your fingers. If your ring and pinkie finger are curling up and it is difficult to straighten them out completely, you may have Dupuytren's contracture.You may also be able to feel thick cords developing under the skin between the palm and one or two of your fingers. These cords are what is causing the loss of finger function.  , Dupuytren's contracture does occur more often in men of Northern European descent who are over the age of 40. Additionally, it often runs in families, so if you have relatives with the condition you are more likely to get it.There are also other risk factors, such as smoking and diabetes. If you are a smoker or if you have diabetes you have a higher chance of getting this condition. Knowing your risk factors for this condition can help you to assess whether it is likely that you have it. For example, if you have none of the risk factors for Dupuytren's contracture then any symptoms that you have may be caused by a different condition.  , Before you see your doctor you should know what they will ask you, so that you can be prepared to answer. First, you should be able to tell your doctor about all of your symptoms and the risk factors you have for Dupuytren's contracture. You should also try and remember when your symptoms started and if they have changed over time.When making the appointment to see your doctor tell the receptionist about your symptoms. This will allow the doctor to do a little research about conditions that might be causing your symptoms before meeting with you.  , In most cases, a doctor can diagnose Dupuytren's contracture just by looking at and feeling the hands. They will look at the surface of the palms and feel around deep into the palms.When inspecting the hands, the doctor will be feeling for the thick cords inside the hands that are causing the fingers to curl and tighten.  , Your doctor may have you do a tabletop test to assess the extent of your Dupuytren's contracture. With this test you will simply place your palms against the top of a table to see how flat you can get your fingers.During the tabletop test, if the joint closest to your palm is curved more than 40 degrees or the joints further down the fingers are curved more than 20 degrees, then the condition is considered advanced. With fingers this curled, your doctor will likely suggest surgery., In cases of Dupuytren's contracture that are not progressing very quickly and do not inhibit movement or function, it is likely that your doctor will suggest simply keeping an eye on your symptoms. Until the symptoms get bad enough to impact your life, treatment is usually held off.There is no non-invasive treatment for Dupuytren's contracture. This means that all treatments involve injections or surgery in the palms.  , If your condition is early in its progression then you can try steroid injections. They are strong anti-inflammatory medications, so they can help break up nodules early in their development.Steroid injections are more helpful in the early stages of this disease because they cannot break down more thickened tissue and they will not straighten out fingers once they have curled up. Steroid injections will need to be done repeatedly. They are usually done monthly but with a break of several months after three to six treatments., If the condition is impacting the function of your hands, then you can try enzyme injections. These injections are designed to improve the function of your fingers, allowing you to straighten them more.Enzyme injections are more helpful for those that have advanced Dupuytren's contracture, as they work to release the tension that is curling the fingers in. As with all treatments for Dupuytren's contracture, this treatment may not result in full functionality. Also, there is a risk that the symptoms could return even if they are minimized by the treatment initially.  , If your condition is advanced and injections are not helping to minimize it, then your doctor may suggest surgery, and you will be referred to an orthopedic hand specialist if you haven't been already. The surgeries used for this condition include open surgery to remove portions of the thickened bands and needle aponeurotomy, which uses needles poked into the palm to break up the tightened tissue.Needle aponeurotomy can be done in a doctor's office, while open surgery needs to be done in a surgical room. Also, open surgery requires more time to recover. Before surgery, the surgeon should discuss realistic goals and possible risks of the procedure. These include the fact that Dupuytren's contracture cannot be eliminated completely and even if symptoms are minimized, they may return over time. Additionally, there are risks associated with any surgery, including infection at the incision site and a bad reaction to medications that are given.  , When getting other treatments, your doctor may suggest specific stretches to do to increase their effectiveness. While stretching on its own may not do much to increase the flexibility to fingers affected by Dupuytren's contracture, it can be useful when used in combination.Be sure to discuss with your doctor what stretches you should do and when to do them after treatment. While stretches can be done relatively quickly after injection treatments, you should wait until your doctor says it's okay to do stretches after surgery.

"['spend time in a park', 'go to a local petting zoo', 'check at libraries and museums', 'play in the water', 'visit a farm to pick berries', 'take a group of kids fishing']",How to Plan a Play Date for Your Blind or Visually Impaired Child3," There are numerous activities at your local park that can provide sensory stimulation, education, and enrichment for your blind or visually impaired child. A play date at the park also is a great idea if your child has a friend without significant vision impairment.You might pull up plants and examine the roots with your child, or catch bugs. They also may have fun exploring playgrounds, swinging on swings or running their hands over the equipment to see how it's put together. If you live in the United States, you might try NPR's directory of accessible playgrounds nationwide. Just visit www.playgroundsforeveryone.com and type in an address to begin., Because petting zoos focus on the senses of touch, smell, and hearing, they can be great places for a blind or visually impaired child to explore the world and connect with different kinds of animals.The animals at petting zoos typically are very calm and tame, and will allow your child to explore them. Talk to your child about the animal they are touching, the part of that animal the child is touching, and what that animal does. When the child touches a different animal, talk about the differences between the two.  , Many libraries and museums have play-date type activities specifically designed for blind and visually impaired kids. These events can help your child explore their community as well as giving them the opportunity to meet other blind or visually impaired kids their age.Your local library or community center may have a bulletin board where information about activities and events are posted. You also may be able to find this information on the library's website. If your city government has a community events page on its website, you also may be able to find information there. Ask at local museums, especially children's museums, to find out if they have special events or specific days for blind or visually impaired kids.  , If your child enjoys the water, backyard water slides, wading pools, or fountains can provide a fun activity for a play date, especially on hot days. You don't have to get fancy – often a simple garden hose is enough.Keep in mind that if there are too many elements, they can get overwhelming. Try to limit your water play activities to one or two things. If your child doesn't like cold water, you might try running the hose from the kitchen sink so you can use warm water. If you make a slide in the backyard, you can use other liquids on the surface, such as whipped cream, so the kids can enjoy different sensations. Just make sure the liquid you use isn't too slick.  , If you live in or near a more rural area, you may be able to find a working berry farm where you can take your blind or visually impaired child along with a friend. Picking berries engages your child's senses of touch, hearing, and taste.This also can be an educational experience, because the child will learn where berries come from and how they are harvested. Call ahead to the farm before you go and let them know you will have a child who is blind or visually impaired. They may be able to offer specific accommodations, or may have special events for blind and visually impaired kids.  , Fishing is another activity that is both fun and educational. While you'll typically have to help with things like baiting the hook and removing the fish from the line, blind or visually impaired kids can still actively fish themselves.Catching a fish can give your child a sense of accomplishment. The process also teaches your child where fish come from and how they are caught for eating. Holding and touching a fish presents a unique sensory experience for the child, who will be able to feel the muscles in the fish and the flapping gills. If you go somewhere that doesn't require catch-and-release, you also have the opportunity to take the caught fish home and cook them. This will give the child a better sense of how food gets to their plate.  ","['water', 'museums', 'berries', 'local petting zoo', 'group', 'time', 'farm', 'kids fishing', 'park', 'libraries']"
"['skim the material', 'format your outline', 'write the outline', 'annotate your outline', 'be flexible', 'follow instructions']",How to Do a Chapter Outline1," An outline is a useful way to help you summarize information. Your first step to understanding the chapter is to read the material. Skimming means to read quickly and somewhat superficially.Focus on key terms. Many textbooks will put these significant words in bold print to help you quickly locate them. Do not spend too much time trying to read each word. On your first read through, scan the information to get a sense of what the chapter is about. Skim the chapter, reading the introduction and conclusion. Also read the first sentence or two of each paragraph. You are trying to figure out what the main points of the chapter are.; , Once you understand the basic concept of the chapter, it is time to prepare your outline. Most outlines are formatted using a combination of numbers and letters. Typically, the main points are denoted with roman numerals, and the sub points are marked with letters.For example, if you are writing an outline for a chapter about the American Civil War, you want to start by organizing your outline with the main points. It might be something such as: I. The Origins of the Conflict II. Significant Battles III. Impact on the North IV. Impact on the South V. Reconstruction. Once you have your main points, you can add sub points. For I. The Origins of the Conflict, you could add A. Slavery B. State's Rights Make sure that the points of the outline are based on the main points of the chapter. You could consider using the subheadings of the outline as your main points.  , Your outline will include additional components. After you have a format, you can work on writing the introduction. The introduction for your outline should be one paragraph long.The most important thing to include in your introduction is the thesis statement. The thesis is the argument, or main point, of the chapter. For example, the thesis in the chapter on the Civil War might be, ""The Civil War was a victory for the North because of more material resources, such as metals, and a larger population base."" Rewrite the thesis in your own words, and include it in your introduction. Your introduction should also give a brief overview of the significant points in the chapter. The introduction should be at the beginning of the outline. Once that is finished, you can fill in the numerals and numbers with your main points.  , An effective outline will be succinct. You do not need to rewrite the entire chapter. However, you will want to add enough information to each of your points to give you a clear idea of what you are trying to comprehend.An annotation is a comment or explanation. Include an annotation for each of your sub points. For example, you could annotate I. The Origins of the Conflict, A. Slavery, by saying something like, ""The South was resistant to reforming society without 4 million slaves. This was also an ideological cause of the war. The annotations should provide enough information to be useful, but not enough to overwhelm you when you are trying to review your outline. 2-3 sentences is about the right length.  , It's a good idea to have a pretty clear picture of what you want your outline to look like. However, you should also be open to making changes. Remain flexible while you're working on your outline so that you can shape it to best fit your needs.   Leave room to add points. Maybe you originally planned to have only 5 main points, but you realized there are actually 6 topics that you need to cover. Go ahead and add an additional point. Just make sure that what you add truly does need to be a key point. If it would work just as well as a sub point, it's probably best to make it one. You can also remove material. Maybe your initial impression is that submarine warfare was a major factor in the outcome of the Civil War. If you later change your mind, you can remove that point.  , Sometimes your instructor might assign an outline as a graded assignment. It is a useful way to help you learn new skills. Your outline can also help your teacher tell if you are focusing on the right concepts.Complete all of the requirements. If your teacher asks for an 8 point outline, then your outline should have 8 points. Ask for clarification. If you have questions about how to format your outline, ask your instructor for some specific guidelines.  ","['material', 'outline', 'instructions']"
"['determine the purpose of your valuation', 'describe exactly what is being valued', 'choose the proper valuation method', 'hire help', 'make a checklist', 'compile financial statements', 'get corporate documents', 'create useful guides', 'allow for a business visit', 'estimate how much money the business can earn', 'determine the availability of assets', 'identify intangible assets', 'consider the nature and history of the business', 'determine the economic and industry outlook', 'use a market-based method', 'choose an income-based method', 'utilize an asset-based method', 'combine multiple methods']",How to Prepare for the Business Valuation Process," People request business valuations for various purposes and each purpose will demand a different valuation process and result. The need to valuate a business might result from wanting to buy or sell a business, gift and estate tax purposes, stock liquidations and transfers, divorces, stock plans, going public, and obtaining financing.   For example, if you are going through a divorce, the valuation process is often set out in statutes. While you may have to use these statutes for the purpose of valuing a business upon divorce, it may not take account of various factors that might be important if you wanted to buy or sell a business. In addition, one party to the divorce may want a higher valuation in order to get his or her ""fair share."" In another example, if you are valuing a business to sell it to a family member, you might not be concerned with obtaining the greatest value possible. Instead, your value will be based on complying with minimum tax requirements.; , Before a business can be properly valuated, you need to know exactly what is at stake. If the entire business is being sold, the entire business will need to valued. If only a few pieces of real property are going to be sold, those pieces of real property will need to be valued. If you are going to offer stock options to certain employees, the value of the stock will need to be determined.  , After determining why and what you are valuing, scan through the possible valuation methods to help you understand what type of information you will need to gather moving forward. While you do not need to choose your valuation method immediately, having an idea of what you want to do will help you prepare for the process.   For example, if you are using a market-based method, you will need to gather information about comparable businesses in your area. If you are using income-based methods, you will need to look closely at your past and present financials in order to determine likely future income. If you are using an asset-based method, you will need to gather information about all of the assets and liabilities the business has on their balance sheet., If you are unsure how to navigate the business valuation process, or if you want professional help to get you the best valuation possible, you can hire valuation consultants, appraisers, business brokers, and lawyers. All of these professionals will help you gather and analyze data, make strategic decisions that can influence value, and actually valuate the business.   Valuation consultants will go through the entire process by your side. They will help you determine the what and why, select an appraiser, interact with the appraiser, gather documents, and analyze those documents.Appraisers will actually valuate the business. Business brokers will help you sell your business if that is why you want the business valued. Reputable brokers will have connections in your market and can help you sell your business quickly and for a fair price.Lawyers will help you comply with any legal requirements you might run into. For example, if you are valuing your business for estate tax purposes, a lawyer will be able to assess possible tax liabilities based on different valuations.  , After assessing your valuation needs, the appraiser you are working with will ask you for various documents to help them valuate the business. As documents are being requested, keep a list of them and check them off as documents are produced. Due to the shear number of documents needed to create an accurate valuation, your list may stretch pages., The financial information needed will include balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and interests the business has in other companies. All of these documents should evidence at least the past five fiscal years. Additionally, be prepared to provide accounts payable/receivable, prepaid expenses, inventory lists, existing contracts, stockholder lists, compensation schedules, budgets, and financial projections  .  All of these documents will be especially helpful if you are going to use an income-based method of valuation., Corporate documents help appraisers understand how the business is structured. By obtaining this type of information, appraisers can begin to consider comparables in your industry. For example, if your business is a C corporation with 10,000 shares of stock available publicly, an appraiser will look for other C corporations with similar attributes when valuing your business.   Corporate documents will include articles of incorporation/partnership, bylaws, amendments, corporate minutes, existing buy/sell agreements, options to purchase stock, and rights of first refusal., In addition to gathering already available documents, you might consider creating documents to help assist others in the valuation process. For example, you might draft a short history of your business including whether you have had any offers to buy in the past, what makes your business unique, and where you stand in relation to other businesses in your industry. You might also create a list of competitors, including their size and location. If you have any intellectual property, make a list of relevant patents, inventions, copyrights, and trademarks., Some appraisers and other interested parties might ask to visit your business in person. You should allow this to happen so long as it is feasible. When individuals visit the business they are valuing, they will walk around and observe the operation. They will also conduct interviews with a wide range of personnel including employees and executives., There are countless business and industry factors that will influence the value of your business. If you understand these factors, you can attempt to increase your business's value by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain factors. The number one factor that influences the value of your business is how much money your business can earn (i.e., how much cash can your business generate). The more earning potential you have, the higher your business's value will be.For example, a highly profitable business with a large future earning potential can use income-based valuation methods to inflate the business's valuation.  , The second most influential factor is your business's asset availability. The more assets you have available, the higher your value could be. However, this is only true if your ratio of assets to liabilities is as high as possible. For example, if an appraiser is using an asset-based valuation method and you have a lot of assets and very few liabilities on your balance sheet, your business's value is going to be high., Some factors that add to the value of a business cannot be liquidated and sold like regular assets. However, these ""intangible"" assets can add incredible value to your business. Intangible assets are any assets that are not physical in nature, including, but not limited to, goodwill, intellectual property, brand recognition, and an assembled workforce. For example, many companies might not have remained as successful as they are today were it not for their established, recognizable brand name or logo.Consider the value of ""Coca-Cola"" versus an unknown soda brand. The value of Coca-Cola is going to be exponentially higher in part because Coca-Cola is a known brand with a lot of business prestige.   Intangible assets do not add to the book value of a business. This is because book value, which refers to the dollar amount of a business's net assets held on its balance sheet, only includes directly measurable assets. Market value is a separate assessment of business value that incorporates different analyses of intangible assets, earnings potential, and other aspects of the market. In practice, it refers to the total value of outstanding stock shares for a publicly-traded company., The value of your business will increase or decrease based on where your business is located, how long it has been in existence, how good your reputation is, and if equipment is new or needs to be replaced.For example, your business's value will be higher if it is located in Los Angeles, California as opposed to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In addition, your business will be valued higher if you have very little competition. In another example, assume you own a dental practice you ware having valuated. Your dental practice will be valued higher if all of your dental equipment (e.g., chairs, lights, x-ray machines) is new (as opposed to old).  , Your business's value is unavoidably linked to economic and industry conditions. For example, if the economy is doing well and buyers are looking to purchase businesses, the value of your business will be higher. On the other hand, when interest rates go up and money gets tight, the value of your business will go down.   Certain industries will also rise and fall with the times. For example, when the threat of terrorism and war is high, the value of weapons manufacturers goes up.  , When the time comes, a qualified appraiser will synthesize all of the information you provided and work to valuate your business. If the appraiser uses a market-based method, he or she will find multiple sources of comparable information and make adjustments to create a valuation. For example, an appraiser may utilize public and private sources to research and collect business transaction data. They will analyze the similarities and differences between your business and the comparables and will create a valuation.This method will not work with every business. For example, small, closely held companies cannot usually use market-based valuation methods because it is hard to find true comparables., If your appraiser is using an income based-method, he or she will calculate the probable future income of your business and capitalize that income to create a value. To do this, the appraiser will adjust your revenues and expenses in order to create a normalized income stream. They will then capitalize this normalized income stream (i.e., determine its present value) and come up with the value of your business.   This method works really well for highly profitable businesses with high potential future earnings., When your appraiser utilizes an asset-based method, he or she will adjust each asset and liability on your balance sheet to create a fair market value for each one. Those fair market values are then added together to equal your business's valuation.   This method ignores earnings and should therefore not be used to value income producing businesses (e.g., businesses that sell products or offer services). This is an appropriate method for businesses that manage income producing assets., Appraisers may combine multiple methods together to create hybrid valuations. In doing so, appraisers can take account of multiple facets of your business in order to create the most accurate valuation possible. For example, one popular hybrid method is the ""excess earnings"" method. Using this method, your business's earnings over the norm will be calculated and capitalized. This value is then added to the fair market value of your assets to determine an overall value.","['market-based method', 'income-based method', 'proper valuation method', 'useful guides', 'intangible assets', 'history', 'much money', 'purpose', 'industry outlook', 'business', 'valuation', 'financial statements', 'nature', 'availability', 'help', 'multiple methods', 'assets', 'corporate documents', 'business visit', 'asset-based method', 'checklist']"
"['understand the difference between soluble and insoluble fiber', 'substitute soluble fiber heavy foods with insoluble fiber heavy foods', 'use dried beans', 'rather than canned beans', 'in your meals', 'avoid cauliflower', 'broccoli', 'and cabbage', 'add fiber to your diet slowly', 'eat 20 to 35 grams (1.2\xa0oz) of fiber a day if you are an adult', 'drink water with every meal']",How to Decrease Gas Caused by Fiber in Diet1," It’s important to understand the two forms of fiber, and which foods contain soluble or insoluble fiber.Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like material, which can lower your cholesterol and blood glucose levels. It also slows down your digestion and is more likely to cause gas. It is found in foods like oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables. Consume more water to help absorb soluble fiber. This is important when taking any fiber supplement as well. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water. It promotes movement in your digestive tract, so it accelerates your digestion. As a result, it causes you to have less gas than soluble fiber. Insoluble fiber is found in foods such as whole wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, green beans, and potatoes.; , It’s important to balance your fiber consumption so you eat both insoluble and soluble fiber sources. This will help you stay healthy and get enough fiber in your diet.But to cut down on gas, try substituting certain soluble fiber foods with insoluble fiber foods.For example, oat bran contains mostly soluble fiber, and wheat bran contains more insoluble fiber. So, regular wheat bran cereal or bran muffins may cause less gas than oat bran cereal or oat bran muffins., Beans are known to be major sources of gas, but dried beans may cause less gas, post meal. Soaking the dried beans overnight before you eat them can lessen the impact of beans on your digestive system. , These foods are great sources of fiber, but they can cause gas and bloating. If possible, limit your consumption of these foods to once a month, or substitute these foods for other vegetables that are less gas-inducing.Leafy green vegetables like spinach, collard greens, and lettuce are mostly packed with insoluble fiber, so they are a good source of nutrients and should cause less gas. Avoid raw vegetables, as they are harder for your body to break down and can lead to gas. Steam or cook vegetables before you eat them., The bacteria in your stomach and small intestine need time to catch up with your fiber consumption. Adding too much fiber too quickly can cause gas, bloating, cramps, and diarrhea. Increase your fiber intake about 5 grams (0.2 oz) per a day, over a period of 1-2 weeks, to allow your body time to adjust.You may experience bloating and gas at the beginning of your fiber intake. But over time, your body will adjust to the fiber and you should see a reduction in bloating and gas.Remember to increase fiber with water at the same time. Increase water intake anytime you add fiber to your diet to prevent constipation.  , The recommended fiber intake for older children, adolescents, and adults is no more than 35 grams (1.2 oz) of fiber a day.Younger children will not be able to eat enough calories to achieve this amount of fiber in their daily diet. But you should introduce whole grains, fresh fruits, and leafy greens to your child’s diet so they can build up their tolerance for fiber over time.  , Water helps to push the fiber through your digestive system. Staying hydrated also prevents the fiber from hardening and obstructing your intestine. Dehydration and a build up of fiber in your body can lead to some uncomfortable moments in the bathroom.You should also stay hydrated if you drink coffee throughout the day. Caffeine is a diuretic that pulls fluids from your body and makes you urinate. This can lead to dehydration. For every 1 cup of caffeinated fluid you consume, you should drink 2 glasses of decaffeinated fluids. Too much caffeine in your body, coupled with a fiber rich diet, can lead to constipation and gas.","['grams', 'beans', 'meals', 'canned beans', 'meal', 'oz', 'fiber', 'drink water', 'difference', 'diet', 'cauliflower', 'day', 'insoluble fiber', 'cabbage', 'insoluble fiber heavy foods']"

Above all, your will to live and to ""beat the odds"" will sustain you even when your situation seems utterly hopeless. This basic principle holds true for every situation in which a person is forced to live in a dangerous or outright hostile environment. It doesn't matter if you're in a combat zone, lost in the jungle, or if you've crashed your plane into the side of a mountain or find yourself in an abusive relationship, sheer determination is what separates the survivors from the ""statistics"".; , A warm, dry place not only keeps you out of the elements and gives you a somewhat secure place in which to plan your next move, but also provides many psychological benefits.  , It is imperative that you remain calm and think! If you let panic overrule common sense and critical thinking, then you set yourself up for a series of mistakes in a situation that leaves little room for error.  , Take stock of yourself and your surroundings. Surviving for a long period of time in adverse conditions means conserving your resources and knowing where and how to gather more. Resources can also include allies (anyone available to you who is trustworthy and willing to help). Don't isolate yourself, accept assistance from allies if it is available. This applies especially if the ""enemy"" is a human or large animal.  , In most survival scenarios the elements (i.e. heat, cold, predators, terrain, etc.), along with hunger and thirst are the antagonists. In other cases, such as combat or an abusive relationship, the ""enemy"" is an actual person or group. In all cases you must learn as much as you can about what or whom you are dealing with.  , This is the tricky part because of the danger inherent in both of these courses of action. If you are relatively sure that someone at least has some idea of where you are then you might want to stay put so you will be easier to find. If you are unsure, then your best course of action might be to strike out on your own and move toward a location that will offer you the best chance of being rescued. You can literally ""what if"" yourself to death about this so trust your instincts and make a decision. Right or wrong, at least you will be doing something to save your own life.  , There are many ways to do this. One way is to come up with three workable plans incorporating the information and resources gathered in steps three through six and then work through a list of pros and cons for each plan. Pick the most feasible of the three and file the other two away as back-up plans. However, it is vitally important that you remember to remain flexible! No matter how good your plan is, it is likely that you will have to adjust to unforeseen circumstances.  ","['shelter', 'enemy', 'stick', 'situation', 'resources', 'plan']"
"['know that shading give objects depth', 'think about the light sources', 'note the edges of the shadow', 'map your shading before beginning', 'focus on gradual transitions', 'blend your shadows', 'practice shading simple objects', 'learn the different types of shading']",How to Get Good at Drawing3," Shading is what makes a drawing pop and prevents it from feeling flat. A big part of the illusion of three-dimensions in good drawings is the shading. But shading is tough to master, especially when you are trying to shade something from your imagination or memory.   Shading can imply lines as well. Think about the two small ridges between your nose and upper lip. While you could draw lines for them, that would make them unrealistically pronounced. Try shading them in instead, darkening the areas around them lightly to make them “appear” in the middle of the dark patches.  , Shadows are created because they are exposed to less light then other parts of the scene. Where the light is coming from, what type of light it is, and even the time of day will all affect your shadows. Shadows are created on opposite sides of the light. For example, if you place a ball down and shine a light on it from the right, the left side of the ball will appear darker. This is where you would shade if you were drawing the ball.  , The edge of the shadow is how quickly it disappears. Think of trying to make a shadow puppet—when your hand is close to the light and the wall, there is a hard edge where your shadow and the light meet; but when your hand is farther away you shadow softly fades into the light. Note however, the all shadows have a slightly soft edge. The difference between shading and contour drawing is the fading at the edges.Direct light, like spotlights and clear, sunny days, creates dramatic shadows with hard edges. Indirect light, light far away lights, multiple lights, or cloudy days, create softer, muted shadows with faded edges.  , Make soft, gentle lines around the edges of your shadows before starting them so that you know where you are going to.   Map out the highlights: where is the light the strongest? Is there any glare? Sketch out the shading: where does the shadow on each object start and stop? Contour any hard shadows. Are there any dark shapes created by the light, like a person’s shadow in the sun?  , Shading is the art of gradually changing the amount of light from one area to the other. Start lightly, shading in the entire object with your lightest pencil strokes. Keep going over the drawing by filling in the darker areas slowly, one shade at a time.  , This is the best way to make realistic, gradual shadows on any drawing. Using a tissue, your finger, or light marks with your pencil, blend the darker areas into the lighter ones by rubbing from dark to light. Most pencils will blend only slightly, while drawing with charcoal allows you to dramatically blend your shadows with your fingers.  , Set up a basic “still life” to practice shading. Simply place several common, easy to draw objects (a ball, small boxes, water bottles, etc.) under a bright light and turn it on. Draw the contours of the objects, then practice shading them in exactly how you see them.   As you get more advanced, add in clear objects, complex shapes, or a second light to practice more difficult shading techniques. Shade in an old children’s coloring book, which are usually simple contour lines, for advanced practice.  , While the most realistic form of shading is an even, gradual blending (“smooth” shading), there are a variety of shading styles for different artists and styles of work. For example, many cartoons use cross-hatching or dots to indicate shading. The basic principle, however, is the same – more marks equals darker shadows. Test our multiple types of shading to find what works best for you.   Hatching: Single, straight lines create shadows. More lines make darker shadows. Cross-hatching: Crisscrossing diagonal lines make up your shadows. The farther apart the lines are, the lighter the shadow is. This works well when shading something with lines, like hair or fur.Stippling: A collection of small, black dots make your shadows. Adding dots makes it look darker, to the point where you may not be able to tell that there are dots on the darker edges. Circular Shading: Making small, overlapping circles around with your pencil, you trace out your shadow. The longer you spend in one area overlapping circles, the darker it will become. This is often the best way to shade with colored pencils.","['shadows', 'shading', 'shadow', 'different types', 'gradual transitions', 'objects depth', 'edges', 'light sources', 'simple objects']"

You can pull it straight back or leave a part if you prefer. Tie it into a ponytail. Because you will be working with multiple ponytails and it can get a bit confusing, this will be referred to as Ponytail #1.      ; , Grab the entire ponytail and bring it toward your face. It will be hanging right in front of your eyes, but don’t worry – it’s only temporary! Clip your ponytail here so that you can work with the rest of your hair without it getting in the way.        , Grab hair on either side of the first section. Bring it towards the back, securing it with a hair elastic into Ponytail #2. It should be directly below the base of Ponytail #1., Split the ponytail right down the middle so that you have a left and right section. Pull Ponytail #2 straight through the two sections of Ponytail #1 so that it’s going toward your face. Just like you did with Ponytail #1, secure Ponytail #2 toward your face with a hair clip so that it is out of the way., Section more hair from the sides, bringing it to the back of your head. This time, include all of the hair from Ponytail #1 as well. Use a hair tie to create Ponytail #3, right below the base of Ponytail #2.        , Just like you did before, divide this ponytail into two equal sections of hair. Take Ponytail #3 up through those two sections and clip it forwards again. Now, you will probably start seeing the pattern you use to create this “braid.”        , Again, gather your hair from the sides of your head and pull it to the back. Include the hair of Ponytail #2. Secure this ponytail with another clear elastic. Once that ponytail is secured, unclip Ponytail #3 from the top of your head. Split Ponytail #3 into two sections, bring Ponytail #4 up through the middle, and clip it to the top of your head.        , Once you’ve reached your neck, secure all of the hair (except the clipped up section) into a low ponytail. Let down the clipped section so that you’re left with two ponytails, which will be used to create the tail part of your braid., After you’ve “braided” to the nape of your neck and secured your hair into low ponytails, you want to go back and create the volume that makes this braid so big. Gently pull on the loops of hair you created when you split each ponytail into two sections. You want to loosen them carefully so they aren’t pulled tightly against your head.        , After you’ve pulled on the loops in order to loosen up the strands of hair, gently pull them outwards to add volume. In other words, the loops should be loosened up so that you can pull them wide. The larger your loops become, the thicker and more voluminous your hair will look in this braid.        , This step is optional. After you’ve tugged and fluffed the loops so that you’re satisfied with how they look, it can be helpful to secure them a bit with some hairspray. This will help hold your braid in place all day, and it can also help reduce flyaways.        , As you begin the tail of your braid, you should be starting with two low ponytails at the nape of your neck. You will be finishing the tail of your braid using the same method you used for the beginning of your braid. Pull the lower ponytail through the two sections of the upper ponytail, clipping it out of the way.         Clip your lower ponytail carefully so you don’t mess up the section of your braid that is already completed. You can even hold it in your mouth if that is easier than using a hair clip.  , After you’ve pulled your lower ponytail up through the two sections of the upper ponytail, bring these two sections back together. Secure them into a ponytail with yet another elastic. Unclip or let go of the clipped up ponytail, which is now on top.        , Split the top ponytail into two sections. Bring the bottom ponytail through the two sections and clip it out of the way. Secure the two sections back together into a ponytail. Secure the end with one hair elastic and examine your work. Loosen up any pieces that look tight or flat, and you’re all set!

You can use this mixture to clean:Telephones, doorknobs, and other surfaces: spray on and wipe off Mirrors and glass: spray on and wipe dry with a rubber squeegee blade Freezer and refrigerator: soak a cloth with the solution and wipe the surface to clean and remove odors Microwave: fill a small bowl with the solution and microwave on high for two minutes, then wipe down the inside of the microwave; , This all-purpose cleaner recipe is more diluted than the disinfectant, but it’s still great for many cleaning jobs around the house. Just spray the cleaner on and wipe down things like counters, walls, toys, tables, blinds, and other surfaces. To make the cleaner, combine:3 cups (705 ml) of water 1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lemon juice 10 drops lemon essential oil  , A basic floor cleaner is more diluted than all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants. Make this cleaner as necessary when it’s time to clean the floors. This solution can also be used on counters, tiles, and for other minor cleaning needs around the house.   In a large bucket, combine ½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar and ½ gallon (1.9 L) of warm water.Soak a mop or sponge in the solution, wring out the excess, and wipe the floor. Allow the floor to air dry.  , Mattresses are difficult to clean because they can’t go in the washing machine, can't be taken to the dry cleaner, and are too large and unwieldy to wash in the normal ways. But you can make an odor-killing disinfectant with vinegar:   In a spray bottle, combine 1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar, ¼ cup (59 ml) of rubbing alcohol, and 10 drops of tea tree oil.Remove the sheets from the mattress and spray the solution over the entire mattress. Let the mattress air dry throughout the day.  , Polishing tarnished metals with cleaner is a smelly job that requires care because commercial metal cleaners are strong chemical solutions. You can make your own polish for copper, pewter, and brass instead. To make and use this paste:Combine 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, ½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar, and enough flour to make a paste Apply the paste to the tarnished metal with an old toothbrush or jewelry brush Leave the paste on the metal for about 15 minutes Rinse under warm water Buff the metal with a dry microfiber cloth  , A vinegar-based stain remover can be used to remove stains and tough dirt from carpets, clothes, upholstery, drapes, and even dishware. Simply spray the cleaner on the affected surface, let it soak for two minutes, and then blot the area with a cloth.   To make a stain remover for fabrics, combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid laundry soap, and 1 cup (235 ml) of warm water in a spray bottle.To make a stain remover for hard surfaces, combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid dish soap, and 1 cup (235 ml) of warm water in a spray bottle.  , Vinegar and baking soda cleaning pastes are great for carpets, tough dirt, baked on grime, stovetop grease, getting crayon off walls, pet accidents, and other hard-to-clean messes. Just stir together 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vinegar and ¼ cup (55 g) of baking soda until they foam and become a paste.To use this cleaner, apply a small amount to the affected area. Rub in the paste with an old toothbrush or non-abrasive scrubber. Blot the area with a damp sponge to remove dirt and excess cleaner. For carpets, vacuum when dry.  , Showers, tubs, and sinks are prone to mineral deposits, mold, mildew, soap scum, and other household cleaning nightmares. But you can use these two simple ingredients, baking soda and vinegar, to keep these surfaces sparkling and clean. To do this:Saturate a cloth or sponge with pure vinegar Sprinkle liberal amounts of baking soda on the sponge Scrub showers, shower doors, bathroom and kitchen sinks, and tubs with the sponge Re-soak the sponge and add more baking soda as necessary Rinse with clean water  , Clogged and slow-running drains are never fun to deal with, and commercial drain cleaners are dangerous and corrosive. Instead, try baking soda and vinegar to unblock your drains next time you're facing a clog. All you have to do is:Fill the affected drain with 1 cup (220 g) of baking soda Pour in 1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar Let the mixture bubble and foam for 30 minutes Pour a kettleful of boiling water down the drain to flush it out  , The acid in vinegar makes it perfect for dissolving the mineral deposits and other clogs that can block up shower heads, coffee makers, and even filters. To use vinegar in this way:Showerheads: Fill a plastic bag with vinegar. Wrap the bag around the showerhead and use an elastic to hold it in place, so the showerhead is soaking in vinegar. Let it soak overnight. In the morning, remove the bag and rinse the showerhead with water. Coffee maker: Fill the coffee maker’s water reservoir with vinegar and run the machine through a brew cycle. Dump out the vinegar. Run the machine again with just plain water to rinse it out. Humidifier filters: Remove the filter from the humidifier. Fill a large shallow pan with vinegar and submerge the filter. Let the filter soak for one to two hours, or until the deposits and clogs dissolve or come loose.  , Sticker residue can seem nearly impossible to remove from certain surfaces, especially if the sticker was there for a long time. To remove a sticker with vinegar, peel off as much of the sticker as you can with your fingers. Then, apply vinegar to the area with a paint brush or sponge. Let the vinegar soak for 10 minutes, and then scrape the residue with a plastic scraper., You can increase the cleaning and washing power of your dishwasher and washing machine by adding vinegar to their regular cycles. Not only will you have cleaner dishes and clothes, but you'll also get the stain-removing and deodorizing benefits of vinegar.   For the dishwasher, add 2 cups (470 ml) of vinegar to the bottom of the dishwasher before starting the cycle. For the washing machine, add 1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar directly into the drum during the rinse cycle to help break down stains and soften clothes., Cutting boards can harbor bacteria and organisms that can make you and your family sick. To kill these and keep your cutting boards clean and disinfected, dampen a cloth with vinegar and wipe the cutting board after each use. Allow to air dry before using again., Mold and mildew can form easily in the bathroom and other areas that are often damp. To prevent mildew from growing on your shower, sink, and tub walls, wipe them down with a squeegee after each use and then spray the walls with plain vinegar.   To prevent mildew on the shower curtain, shake off excess water after a shower and then spray the curtain with vinegar., The toilet is another place in your house where dangerous bacteria can linger, so vinegar can come in handy here too. To clean and disinfect the toilet, pour 1 cup (235 ml) of straight vinegar into the toilet bowl and let it sit overnight. Scrub the bowl in the morning and flush to rinse it out.You can also spray straight vinegar on the toilet seat and around the outside of the bowl. Let it sit for about 30 minutes, and then wipe the surface with a damp cloth or rag.  , Litter boxes can stink and can harbor bacteria, so it’s important to keep them clean. Every time you change the litter, dump the old litter, rinse the pan, and fill the bottom with ½ inch (1.3 cm) of vinegar. Let the vinegar sit for about 15 minutes. Rinse out the pan with clean water.Let the litter pan air dry before filling it with fresh litter.

"['identify your goals', 'make a study plan', 'begin studying well in advance', 'gather your materials', 'choose a study location', 'go to office hours', 'organize a study group']",How to Study for Finals1," Before you begin studying, it is important to identify what your goals are. Set a target grade for each exam and think about what you will need to do to achieve that grade.   Be realistic; consider how well you've been doing all year, how good your understanding of the material is and window of time you have to study. Don't set your goals too low either. Try to push yourself and set your mind to achieving your full potential.; , Making an effective and realistic study plan is a vital component of doing well in your finals. By planning out your study, you can ensure that you will have all the necessary materials covered by the time the exams roll around, thus minimizing stress and maximizing productivity. Here are some things you will need to consider:   Create a time chart of your current activities. Factor in classes, work, time spent with family and friends, etc. This will allow you to see how much free time you have available for study. Develop a study schedule that works with your timetable. Use time between classes, commute time and any other free time to slot in some extra study. Keep in mind that an hour of study every day will be more productive than a 5-hour block once a week. Determine your study goals. You shouldn't just write vague guidelines like ""study biology"" -- your study plan needs to be specific. Break down your study material into specific topics and tasks and fill these into your study schedule. Give 20-minute slots to small, bite-size chunks of information and commit to the idea that you will know that information inside out by the end of those 20 minutes. Stick to your schedule. A study schedule is no good if you don't stick to it. That's why it needs to be realistic. Factor in breaks and potential distraction when planning, so there will be no excuses when the time comes. If it helps, think of the study schedule like a job. You have no option but to do it. Consider that studying for a certain subject might take longer than you thought, so put in some extra time into your schedule.  , This may seem like a bit of a no-brainer, but the earlier you start studying, the more prepared you'll be come exam time. Starting early ensures that you will have time to cover all the necessary material, time to do practice exams and maybe even time to do some extra reading, which will give you an edge on the day. By beginning to study well in advance, you will also feel less stressed out and anxious and have more confidence in yourself.   Ideally, you should make studying part of your weekly routine throughout the school year, not just coming up to exams. You should prepare for classes by doing the required readings, along with some extra reading around the topic under discussion. Engage with your professors, ask questions about anything you don't understand and take extensive notes, as these will be an invaluable study tool later. After class, review the material and rewrite or type out the rough notes you took during class. This will help you to retain the information much better when it comes to exam time. Do not procrastinate. Everybody is guilty of procrastination at some point, but coming up to finals you should make a serious effort to avoid it. View your study schedule as being set in stone. By actually doing your study when you say you're going to do it, you minimize the risk of cramming the week or night before the exam. Tempting as it may be to put off study until the last possible moment, cramming so close to the exams is an ineffective way to study. Cramming lowers the chances of you actually retaining any information and dramatically increases stress levels. So do not procrastinate!  , Gather and organize all of the materials and resources necessary for you to ace your exams. Get together your class notes, old tests and assignments, class handouts, past exam papers and relevant textbooks.   Use folders, highlighters and sticky notes to organize the material and make important information easily accessible. Read through your class notes and underline any key words, formulas, themes and concepts. Your class notes are a valuable study resource as they are more succinct than textbooks and will give you some clue as to what the professor is most likely to emphasize in the exam. Ask to borrow a classmates notes to compare with your own if you feel there are gaps. Find some different textbooks from the ones you normally use. An alternative textbook may provide extra information that will make you stand out from the rest of the class, or it might phrase a definition in a way that enables you to fully understand it for the first time.  , Choosing the right location is an important aspect of effective study. The ideal study location will differ from person to person. Some people might prefer to work at home, where they can grab a cup of coffee or a snack whenever they feel like it. Others prefer to work in a library, where they are surrounded by other focused individuals and have minimal distractions. You need to find what works for you. It may be a process of trial and error until you find the setting that works best for you, or you may find that a combination of different locations makes the process less monotonous and easier to stick to.  , Office hours are a service that most students are either too lazy or too afraid to avail of. However, most professors or T.A.'s are delighted to see students taking an interest and will be more than happy to answer any questions or address any concerns that you might have.   Just by making the effort to go to office hours, you are giving the professor a favorable impression of yourself, which might influence their thinking when grading your exam. Discussing the course material with your professor may also give you some clue as to what he/she considers to be the most important topics on the course, and thus the most likely to come up in the exam. He or she may also be able to steer you in the right direction when it comes to exam technique and what they will be looking for in the exam.  , Study groups can be a great idea for people who have trouble motivating themselves to study. Choose a group of people you like and work well with and organize a 2 or 3 hour study session once a week. In a group setting, you can can bounce ideas off other people, work through difficult problems together, and ask questions that you would be afraid to ask a professor. You may also be able to divide the workload between you.   For example, if you are studying from a textbook with long, complicated chapters from which only key information is needed, you could try taking a chapter each and summarizing its contents for everyone in the group. This way you can get through a lot of information in a relatively short space of time. When working in a study group, it is important that everyone in the group is at a similar level and has a similar work ethic. Otherwise the study group won't work, as one person may end up doing all the work, or another might be completely left behind. Don't feel bad if you need to pull out of a study group that's not working for you. Doing well is what's most important.

"['try the ""withdrawal method', 'use the ""calendar method', 'track your fertility using physiological markers.one way to track your fertility is to use physiological markers such as basal body temperature measurements', 'and/or observing cervical mucus discharge', ""to help pinpoint the specific days when the woman's fertility peaks"", 'understand that natural methods still pose a risk of pregnancy']",How to Prevent Pregnancy Without a Condom2,"""One way to diminish the chances of pregnancy without using a condom is to try the withdrawal method. This method consists of the man removing his penis just prior to ejaculation, so that the sperm do not have a chance to travel up the woman's vagina in a way that may lead to pregnancy.   The challenge with this method is that some sperm may leak out prematurely (prior to ejaculation and thus prior to withdrawal of the man's penis), which is what makes this method only 78% effective at preventing pregnancy.  ,""Technically, there are only a few days each month when a woman can actually become pregnant. Most women have a 28 day cycle, which starts on the first day of her period. On average, ovulation occurs on day 14, but a woman can be fertile for several days before and after ovulating.   If a woman has sex significantly before or after her most fertile days, her chances of becoming pregnant are much lower. The downside to the calendar method is that not all women have exactly 28 day cycles. There is quite a bit of variability between women, and one woman may even find that her own menstrual cycles are not completely consistent from month to month. It is for this reason that this method is only 76% effective at preventing pregnancy, without the use of a condom. If your cycle is consistently more or less than 28 days, subtract 14 days from the END of your cycle and consider this the start of your most fertile few days. The second half of a woman's menstrual cycle (following ovulation) tends to be much more consistent than the first half of the cycle (prior to ovulation).  , You can then avoid having sex on those days when the woman's fertility is high.   With the ""basal body temperature"" method, a woman measures her temperature first thing in the morning and before eating every day. It will rise 0.4-1.0 degrees Fahrenheit following ovulation. Therefore, it is advisable to use a condom, a spermicide, or another non-hormonal form of birth control from the first day following the woman's period to three days after her basal body temperature has risen. With the ""cervical mucus"" method, the woman observes the characteristics of her cervical mucus discharge. There is typically no mucus discharge immediately following a period, mild and sticky secretions in the days after that, greatly increased mucus secretions that are more wet and clear in the days surrounding ovulation, and no noticeable secretions following the end of her ""fertile period"" all the way until the beginning of the woman's next menstrual cycle. Therefore, during days when cervical mucus is abundant, clear and wet, it is important to avoid sexual intercourse as this is when a woman's fertility is at its peak., Both the withdrawal method as well as the calendar method are significantly less effective than the medical methods of contraception. It is important not to rely on these techniques if you are truly seeking to avoid a pregnancy. Here's why:   If you are a man and you inadvertently get a woman pregnant, in most places she has 100% choice as to whether or not to proceed with the pregnancy (or whether to get an abortion). This may mean that, by getting a woman pregnant, if she chooses to keep the baby you are now responsible financially to help out, and may take on the responsibilities of co-parenting duties as well. Both men and women are impacted by unintended pregnancies. Having the responsibilities of supporting a baby before you are ready can significantly impact (and potentially get in the way of) other plans you may have, regarding career, relationships, or any other sphere of life. If you are the woman and you inadvertently become pregnant, you may be faced with the challenging decision of whether or not to keep the baby or to proceed with abortion, if this is legal in your area.

These kinds of accidents can cause serious damage. If your livestock injures someone in this manner, then you can expect to be sued. Accordingly, you should meet with a lawyer as soon as possible. Don’t wait until the lawsuit is filed.   You can get a referral to an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Once you have a referral, you can schedule a consultation. Many lawyers now offer free or reduced-fee consultations. Take relevant documents, such as police reports and photographs, to the attorney.  , You should also think about hiring the lawyer to represent you. If costs are a concern, then discuss different billing arrangements with the lawyer. For example, she might be willing to represent you for a flat fee instead of the usual billable hour.   Also, the lawyer might be willing to do only the work that you give her. This is called “limited scope representation.” For example, you might handle all of the pre-trial work yourself but hire a lawyer to represent you at trial. Ask the lawyer during your consultation if he or she offers this service.  , If you run a farm, then you should be carrying insurance to cover accidents caused by your livestock. Take out your policy and find the contact number.   You shouldn’t delay contacting your insurer. Your policy usually contains a deadline for reporting claims. You should report them as soon as possible.  , Once a lawsuit is filed, the plaintiff will send you a copy of the complaint and the summons. Go through each document carefully to see what facts the plaintiff alleges in support of the lawsuit.   You will probably be sued for “negligence.”Negligence means that you were not reasonably careful in how you penned up the animal. This is a fact-specific inquiry. The jury will need to look at how you restrained your livestock—with a fence, by keeping them in a locked barn, etc.—and whether these actions were reasonable.  , You can defend against a negligence claim by arguing that you were sufficiently reasonable in the care you took to restrain the animal. For example:   The fences you installed were in good working condition and were sufficiently high to keep the animal from escaping. The day of the accident, the fence might have failed because of damage caused by a storm. You weren’t responsible for the animal escaping. Instead, someone else (like a vandal), broke the fence or otherwise released the animal.The injured person helped cause the injury. For example, if someone sneaks onto your property and frees an animal, then he is responsible if the animal then stomps on him.  , You will need to draft an answer and file it with the court before the deadline stated in the summons. You should get an answer form from the court where the lawsuit has been filed.  , If you have an attorney, then the attorney can represent you. A trial typically consists of jury selection, the presentation of witnesses and evidence, and opening and closing statements. If you hire an attorney, then the attorney can handle the trial.   You might not be able to hire a lawyer. Accordingly, you will need to represent yourself. For information on how to defend yourself at trial, see Represent Yourself in Court (U.S.).  , Your testimony at trial can be critical. In particular, the jury will want to know what you did to restrain your animals. You can expect the plaintiff’s lawyer to cross-examine you about your actions. To make an effective witness, remember the following:Show respect for the seriousness of the situation. Dress professionally, as you would for a job interview, and treat everyone politely. Speak clearly and simply. Don’t provide additional information unless the lawyer asks for it. Always answer out loud, using whole words. Don’t mumble, shrug, or say “uh huh.” Look at the lawyer asking questions but then turn to the jury when you answer.  , If you lose at trial, you might want to appeal. You should discuss an appeal with an attorney. To bring an appeal, you need to pay to have court transcripts created. You also need to pay a filing fee, which can be expensive.   If you choose to file, then don’t delay. After the verdict is announced, ask the court clerk for a Notice of Appeal form. You can always choose not to file the form if you meet with an attorney and decide an appeal is not worthwhile.  ","['lawyer', 'complaint', 'insurance company', 'behalf', 'defenses', 'trial']"

For non-iPhone users, your photo manager app may appear among your other app icons or in a scrolling bar at the bottom of the screen. Inside your photo app, you’ll find all of the photos you’ve taken or saved, along with the various subfolders they’ve been grouped into—selfies, Panoramas, Instagram photos, etc.; , Sort through your stored photos to find the ones you want to remove from your device. You can either browse your entire gallery (known as the “Camera Roll” on iPhones) to see them all laid out in one place or explore different subfolders if you have them separated. Tap a photo to select and enlarge it.Selecting a photo will also allow you to find out more about it, such as the file size and type and the date it was taken or saved.  , Once the photo is displayed on the screen, look for the delete option in the upper or lower righthand corner. On most devices, this appears as an icon in the form of a trash can. Tap this icon to select the photo for deletion.Most devices will ask you to confirm whether or not you want to delete the photo. Simply choose “delete” to move forward with the process, or “cancel” if you’ve changed your mind. Choosing to delete a photo doesn’t actually remove it from your phone. Instead, it sends it to a “recently deleted” folder, where it can be either be recovered or permanently erased.  , If you’re trying to delete several pictures at once, you can save time by batching them together. Pull up your photo manager app so that you’re looking at an overview of all your pictures. Hit the trash icon or “select” option on your screen, then tap each photo you want to remove individually. After you’ve finished selecting the photos, your phone will erase all of them at the same time.This function is useful if you want to hand pick which photos stay or go, or you’re trying to destroy all evidence of a bad selfie session. Be careful not to accidentally select a photo you want to keep.  , Deleting a picture only removes it from your photo gallery. To erase it from your device once and for all, go back to the main screen of your photo app and look for the “recently deleted” folder. All the photos you’ve deleted will remain here for a certain amount of time before they’re erased automatically. To speed up this process, tap the “select” option and either choose which photos you want to delete permanently or hit “delete all” to clear the photos out of your storage.It’s impossible to recover a photo after it’s been erased from the deleted files folder, so be certain you can live without it. Photos will usually stay in the “recently deleted” folder for 30 days before they’re automatically deleted.","['device', 'photos', 'photo manager app', 'photo', 'trash', 'icon', 'select multiple photos']"

Philosophy papers require skillful argument and rational thought, which takes time to develop.Try to begin developing your ideas for your philosophy paper as soon as you get the assignment. Jot down your ideas and use some of your spare time to think about what you want to write about.; , Before you begin to develop your ideas for the paper, make sure that you have carefully read all of the materials that are related to the assignment. If you read the materials, but do not remember much or do not understand part of what you read, then you should reread the texts before you attempt to work on your paper.Having a solid understanding of the concepts covered in your readings is essential to create an effective paper. Otherwise, your explanation of the philosophy may be flawed or your argument may not hold up.  , Some professors distribute assignment guidelines while others simply describe the assignment in class. Before you start working on your paper, make sure that you have a clear understanding of what your professor is asking you to do.If any part of the assignment is unclear, ask your professor for clarification.  , It is important to keep your audience in mind as you plan your paper and as you write your paper. Your professor is your primary audience member and your classmates might also be part of your audience.You can also think of your audience as a person who has some knowledge of philosophy, but who does not have the same understanding as you do. Therefore, if you introduce a special term or concept, you will need to define it for your audience.  , With philosophy papers, it is best to use quotes from the text only when it is absolutely necessary. The goal of your paper is to explain and evaluate a philosophical argument in your own words. Therefore, you should not rely too heavily on quotes or even paraphrased passages from your sources.Only use a quote when it is necessary to support your point of view. Make sure to provide a citation for every quote or paraphrase that you use from a source. Include the author’s name as well as a page number.  , All philosophy papers need to have a strong thesis. Your thesis states your position for the paper and you will need to make sure that you stay focused on your thesis and support it throughout your entire paper. Keep in mind that a strong thesis states your position as well as why you hold that position.For example, if you plan to refute Aristotle’s idea that beauty is related to virtue, then you would have to provide a brief explanation of why. One reason that you may cite might be that beautiful people are not always virtuous. In this case, your thesis might be something like, “Aristotle’s concept that beauty is related to virtue is false because beauty is often found in those who lack virtue.” You will need to place your thesis at the end of the first paragraph in your essay.  , An outline can help you to stay on track as you draft your paper and ensure that you include everything that you need to include.Try making a simple outline that includes:   ideas for your introduction your thesis main points of your explanation main points in your evaluation along with supporting evidence potential objections and your refutations ideas for your conclusion  , Writing in a flowery, overly complex way will not make you appear to be more knowledgeable about philosophy. It is better to write in your own voice and use simple, direct language to get your point across. Imagine that you are explaining the concept to a friend and making an argument for why you agree or disagree with this concept. What would you say? What examples would you use?Try to avoid padding your work with extra words. This makes it hard for your readers to understand what you mean. Look up new words before you used them. If you like to sue the thesaurus feature ow Word when you write, just make sure that you are looking up the meanings of these words before you include them. The thesaurus does not always provide suggestions that are grammatically correct or equivalent in meaning to the original word.  , Your introduction is important because it gives readers a first impression of your paper. The introduction is your chance to grab your readers’ attention and to provide a preview of your argument. That is why it is important to use your introduction wisely.Avoid introductions that provide a sweeping overview of your topic, such as “Since the dawn of time…” or “All people everywhere have wondered….” Instead, jump right into the topic. For example, you might lead in with something like, “Aristotle often draws a line between beauty and virtue in his work.”  , After your introduction, you will need to explain the philosophical argument or concept that you are planning to refute or support. Make sure that you present the philosopher’s ideas in a clear, objective manner.Do not add or leave out any details that might provide you with an advantage when you start to evaluate the philosophy. Otherwise, your professor may consider your argument to be less effective. Stick to the relevant details of the argument. Do not explain things that you do not plan to argue against in your paper unless they are absolutely necessary for understanding your point., After you have provided a clear explanation of the philosophy, you will need to move on to your evaluation. Your evaluation should work to support your thesis at all times. Do not go back and forth between positions or contradict yourself at any time. Stick to your position no matter what.One great way to support your thesis is by using examples that you draw from personal experiences or that you create. For example, if you are arguing that beauty and virtue are unrelated, then you might give an example of a convicted criminal who many consider to be beautiful.  , A good argument should also acknowledge and refute any objections you’re your opponents might have. Try to identify the strongest objections that an opponent might use to refute your argument and develop responses to these objections.Don’t worry about handling every single objection. Focus on handling the three biggest objections that your opponents might raise. For example, if you are arguing that beauty and virtue are not related, then you might identify an objection that some studies have demonstrated that some men are less attracted to women with undesirable personality traits, despite their beauty.  , Conclusions are also important because they provide an opportunity for you to summarize, clarify, and emphasize one or more important parts of your paper. Try to conclude your paper in a way that will help your readers to see the relevance and significance of your paper.For example, you might explain what your paper has established or how it has added to a philosophical conversation.If your paper is about Aristotle’s concept of the relationship between virtue and beauty, you might discuss how your findings demonstrate the modern separation of image and personality.  , Revising is easier if you can take a break from what you have written for a few days. After you return to the paper again, you will have a fresh perspective that should help you to improve the content of your work more easily than if you had attempted to revise it right away.   If possible set aside your paper for at least three days, but keep in mind that even setting aside your paper for a few hours before you revise is better than nothing.  , Revision is not about fixing typos and grammatical errors. Revision is about seeing what you have written with new eyes and being willing to make major changes, additions, and deletions if it will improve the content of your paper.When you revisit your paper, read it with a focus on the content. Do your arguments hold up? If not, how might you improve them? Are the concepts in your paper clear and easy to understand? If not, how might you clarify these concepts?  , Having someone else take a look at your paper can also help you to improve your work. Someone who is not too familiar with philosophy may also help you to identify areas where you could offer more helpful details.   Try asking a classmate or friend (preferably someone who you know to be a good writer) to take a look at your paper and give you some feedback. Many universities also have writing centers where students can make an appointment and get some feedback from a trained writing tutor. This can also help you to develop effective strategies for revising your own work. You can also make an appointment with your professor if he or she is willing to provide feedback before you submit the paper. Just make sure that you request an appointment at least one week before the paper is due. Otherwise, your professor may not have time to meet with you.  , Proofreading is the final step in the writing process where you check for minor errors and correct them as needed. These little errors can distract your readers, so take time to proofread your work before you submit your final draft.To proofread, go through your paper and correct any typos, grammatical errors, or other minor flaws before you print and/or submit your work. Try reading your paper out loud or reading it backwards one sentence at a time. Mark any errors you find with a highlighter or pencil.

"[""listen for the person's knock and announce"", 'resist the urge to open the door', ""look at the person's uniform"", 'ask the person to show their badge and other identification', 'call the police if you have any doubts']",How to Spot Someone Impersonating a Police Officer2," When a police officer comes to your door, they are usually required to knock and announce their presence.In addition to knocking, police are supposed to state their purpose for being there and announce that they are officers of the law.Impersonators may or may not know about these rules, and therefore an impersonator may not knock and announce themselves as an officer. If someone in a police uniform knocks on your door and does not state their purpose for being there, do not open the door.  , Even if someone in uniform knocks and announces their presence, do not immediately open the door. Ask the person outside to describe the purpose of their visit, and start a dialogue without opening the door. If it is a real officer, they should have no problem explaining their visit and having a conversation through the door until you can verify their identity.   If the person at your door is an impersonator, once you open the door, the barrier between yourself and the impersonator will be gone. Once this happens, the impersonator can get inside where they may want to commit a crime.  , While talking to the person through the door, examine the uniform they are wearing.The clothes themselves should be clean and unwrinkled. Uniforms with stains and uniforms that do not fit properly are good indications of a fake. Also, look for a hat, which is a requirement for police officers. The uniform will always include a badge, name tag, and service tags.The badge will be made out of metal and will never be plastic or flimsy. Service tags indicate the years of service an officer has had on the force.Look for a utility belt with all of the tools of the trade.These tools include a flashlight, firearm, handcuffs, taser, bullet magazines, and pepper spray.The utility belt itself is usually made of woven leather.All officers will carry a radio, so be sure the person you see has one.Try to identify the officer's citation pad., Once you have examined what the person is wearing, or while you are doing so, ask to see the officer's identification. A trained officer should comply with this request promptly and professionally.The officer should have a badge, identification card, and even a photo ID.While an impersonator may be able to fake a badge, it is much more difficult to fake a photo ID and police identification card. If the person cannot show you these things, they may be impersonating an officer.  , If you have any doubt after examining and speaking with the officer, call the police.Dispatchers will know whether an officer has been sent to your home and if they are currently there.The dispatcher will send out a real officer if there is any doubt as to what is unfolding.   Real officers should never be upset if you choose to call the police to verify their identity. This verification process is easy and pain free for the officer, so they should be happy to let you make the phone call. If anyone asks that you not call the police, they may be impersonating an officer.  ","['badge', 'urge', 'doubts', 'uniform', 'person', 'identification', 'door', 'police']"
"['save your money', 'create a budget', 'identify areas where you can reduce spending', 'create an emergency savings fund', 'take advantage of a workplace 401(k) if you have one']",How to Become Rich Someday1," Saving money is one of the most important skills on the path to wealth. While the saying ""a penny saved is a penny earned"" is true to an extent, in reality, a penny saved may equal a dollar earned over time if you properly invest your saved money.   Saving money requires one thing — to spend less than you take in. This is easier to do if you have a solid income (which is why investing in education is important), but it is important to remember that it is possible to save money regardless of your income, even if the amounts are small. Try to start by saving 10% of your paycheck each month. While this is a recommended goal, if this is not possible, simply save what you can, with the goal being to add something to your savings each month.; , A solid budget is the first step on the path to wealth. It helps you to identify all your expenses, and therefore control and reduce them. This, in turn, allows you to save your money which gives you capital to invest with.   On a sheet of paper or in a word processing document, list all your income for the course of a month in one column. At the bottom, add up the sources to determine a total. In another column, do the same for expenses. Make sure to include everything. One helpful way to do this is to examine your bank statement and credit card statement. Add all the expenses in the column together to determine the total monthly expenses.  , Look closely at the expense column to find areas to reduce spending. Your goal should be to create more ""space"" between the total number in the income column, and the total number in the expense column.   One way to do this is to examine the difference between ""wants"", and ""needs"". A need is essential, whereas as a want is option. Look to your ""wants"" each month to find reductions. For example, you may want a brand new phone with a 3GB data plan, while you only need a basic phone with a simple 1GB plan. Consider looking at your needs as well, and examining how to reduce them. For example, rent is a need, but you may be able to find a more affordable apartment in a cheaper area of town, or downgrade from a two-bedroom to a one-bedroom, for example.  , Before you invest at all, always have an emergency savings fund prepared. Experts recommend having at least three months of living expenses set aside in case of a job loss, medical emergency, or unexpected expense.   After an emergency fund is prepared, you can then focus on using your savings to build your investment portfolio.  , About half of American workplaces have access to something called a 401(k), which is a special plan whereby some money is deducted every month from your check and invested. Often, your employer will match all or a portion of your contribution.   The benefit of a 401(k) is that your money can grow tax-free (normally taxes are charged and collected annually on invested money which makes it grow slower). In addition, money you contribute is tax-deductible. This means if you contribute $5,000, you won't pay income tax on that money. Inquire at your workplace if a 401(k) plan is available, and make sure to take advantage of it, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is an excellent way to get started on a path to wealth.  ","['areas', 'money', 'budget', 'advantage', 'spending', 'emergency savings fund', 'workplace']"

The launch driver handles the operation and maintenance of the vessel, in addition to providing passengers with friendly service and useful information. Duties include:   Starting up the boat at the beginning of the day, making sure to check routine fluids including:  The level and condition of the engine oil (should be at the proper level as indicated on the dipstick and not too dirty). The level of the coolant (should be visible when the cap is removed) (warning: never check coolant after running the engine, because hot coolant could spray out under pressure, causing injury). The condition of the transmission fluid (should be dark red and translucent – if it is white and milky, salt has penetrated the transmission housing and must be flushed out before the transmission is engaged). The amount of fuel in the tank – you don’t want to run out while untied in open water!   Tying the launch boat off while picking passengers up at the dock/pier. Greeting the passengers warmly as they enter the boat and providing up-to-date weather information and harbor information. Assisting passengers with stowing additional gear aboard the boat if they require help. Navigating the waterways safely and in accordance with local navigational rules. Planning and executing an efficient drop-off and pickup route around the harbor. Approaching and landing safely on customers’ boats. Helping boaters who need battery jump starts, boat tows, and mooring assistance.; , In many ways, working as launch driver is a great occupation. Passing workdays under the sun and on the open water is relaxing and fun. Often, launch drivers receive benefits such as free boat services at the boat yard or yacht club they work for, discounts on marine products, and flexible schedules. Some launch drivers are fortunate enough to work where tipping is the norm and may make a handsome amount of money in cash.  , On the other hand, the job can include long hours, physically demanding days, and periods of high stress. Working outdoors may sound nice at first, but after twelve hours it can be quite taxing. Additionally, it is often the sole responsibility of the driver(s) on duty to remember on the go which customers have radioed requesting pickups, while simultaneously completing pickups already on their route. This can lead to stress, as sometimes a pickup can slip your mind and anger a waiting customer.  , Being a launch driver requires one to have organizational, logistical, and interpersonal skills.   You must be independent. Being a launch driver requires the confidence to take responsibility for the safety of passengers and respond to variable situations at a moment’s notice. You must be friendly. Although your main duty is to pilot the boat, it is important to remember to interact with the passengers and make them feel at ease. You must be responsible. Navigating varying weather, changing tides, and moving boats requires a risk-averse and conservative attitude.  , Be at least seventeen years of age (eighteen to carry more than seven passengers), an English speaker, and a US citizen. It also helps to be familiar with the basics of boat operation.  ,, Sea service hours prove to the Coast Guard that the applicant is familiar with local waters, weather conditions, and traffic patterns. Log these hours on form CG-719S (Sea Service).   For a USCG Limited Masters license (allows seven or more passengers aboard), 120 days (4+ hours per day) of self-documented sea time with 90 days in the last year are required. For a USCG Limited OUPV license (no more than six passengers aboard), 90 days (4+ hours per day) of self-documented sea time with 90 days in the last year are required.  , The physical makes sure that you are able to perform the duties related to maritime work. It is very similar to a regular doctor’s office physical, but focuses more heavily on vision. Colorblindness, for example, is a disqualifying factor because most maritime markers and buoys are red or green. Have the physician fill out form CG-719K (Physical).   Occupational centers such as Concentra are often fast and easy places to have a pre-employment physical done.  , You must be able to pass a DOT-5 drug panel that tests for marijuana, cocaine, and opiates, among others. The results should be logged on form CG-719P (Drug Testing).  , As the captain of the boat, you must be able to address basic medical situations if a passenger is injured.  , You must complete this class ensuring that you are knowledgeable regarding basic navigation, operation, and boat safety.  , After you pass the exam, you will be given certificate which you will include in your application packet.  , A TWIC is a TSA license. To obtain one, you must visit an enrollment center, be photographed, provide biometric information, get a background check, and pay a fee.  , The completed application should consist of forms CG-719B (Application), CG-719K (Physical), CG-719KE (Entry Level), CG-719P (Drug Testing), and CG-719S (Sea Service). Send them all to your local USCG office.   If your application is approved, you will receive a Merchant Mariner Credential that will allow you to start work as launch driver! Links for some of the aforementioned steps can be found at the bottom of the article.   , Launch driving, and maritime work in general, consists of a very close-knit community. Chances are, if you live in a coastal community, you may know someone who was or is a launch driver. Ask them to recommend you to their employer. This personal introduction can work wonders for quick employment.  , Look for opportunities to meet and interact with maritime professionals, recreational boaters, and dock-hands. These folks are always around the waterfront and will often be aware of job opportunities for the aspiring launch driver.  , Since most launch driving positions are provided by private companies, ask businesses that have established launch services if they have openings.   It is often best to ask about available positions during the off-season, because that is when many of the previous season's drivers leave to work elsewhere.  , Launch driving is a very niche profession. Since there are not many people qualified to drive launch boats, managers and business owners are often hard-pressed to find suitable employees. Approaching a business owner directly can seem daunting, but is often the quickest way to be hired as a launch driver.  , Master the basics of boat operation, maintenance, and customer service during the training period. You will often work without direct supervision as a launch driver. This means that you will need to prove to your employer that you can handle the demands of the job without constant guidance.

A dog that develops bloat at bedtime, if left untreated, will most likely pass away by the morning. Sometimes the deterioration is even more rapid, and the dog may pass away in less than 2 hours after first developing symptoms. Because of this, it is absolutely imperative that you call your vet immediately, as soon as you notice the following symptoms.The key symptoms are a distended abdomen and non-productive retching (vomiting without producing any vomit). These signs alone should trigger an emergency phone call to the vet. However, other signs can also occur, as discussed in the following steps.; , The abdomen (or belly) is the area behind the rib cage that extends back towards the pelvis. The stomach sits within the dome of the diaphragm, but if filled with air, it extends backwards into the belly. A gas filled stomach gives the physical appearance of a swollen belly.In some large breeds (St Bernards, Great Danes) the swollen stomach can be difficult to spot because of room for expansion within the dome of the ribs, therefore, an absence of swelling does NOT rule out gastric dilation. However, a swollen tummy is a significant sign. If in doubt as to whether the tummy is a normal size or not, take a photo of the dog from a sideways angle. Take another photo at 10 minute intervals for comparison. If subsequent photos show the body walls bowing outwards more than previously, this is significant and you should immediately contact the vet  , The swollen stomach is often full of gas or foam. When you place a hand on either side of the swelling and press gently, the area feels hard and not compressible.If you gently flick at the swollen area with a finger (like flicking a drum skin) you may get the impression of a drum like noise due to the trapped air inside the stretched stomach.  , When the stomach flips over it is effectively sealed off. Gastric contents cannot escape; this also means that saliva, food, and water cannot get into the stomach. Thus your dog may drool saliva because he cannot swallow it down.  , The distension triggers receptors in the stomach wall that tells your dog to vomit in order to empty his stomach. However, the twisted stomach is sealed off and although the dog retches or attempts to vomit, he brings nothing up other than drooled saliva.   This is a serious sign and if present, contact the vet immediately.  , As the stomach swells it presses forward on the diaphragm and displaces other abdominal organs backwards. This causes abdominal discomfort which may cause the dog to stand in a hunched position with his back arched.   This is a general sign of abdominal discomfort, rather than specific to GDV, but if seen in conjunction with other symptoms, it should raise concern.  , A dog with a dilated stomach feels uncomfortable and nauseous. This makes it difficult for him to get comfortable and he will pace and be restless.   Some dogs repeatedly turn and look at their flanks, whilst others may even try to kick their belly with a back leg.  , GDV causes distension of the stomach and is a painful condition. Dogs differ in how they show pain but typical signs include:   Vocalisation (whining, groaning, or crying) Dilated pupils A worried expression Changes in behavior such as increased aggression  , As the toxins build up, your dog may start to go into shock. This manifests itself as a weak pulse (the femoral pulse is located on the inner thigh, running parallel with the thigh bone.) A weak pulse can be difficult to detect because of low blood pressure within the vein and is easily lost when pressure is applied with a finger.   The heart rate starts to race and is above normal (greater than 100 beats per minute for a large breed dog, above 140 beats per minute for a regular or small dog). The dog's gums will also be pale (normal color is pink, much like our own gums). If you press a fingertip on the gum and then release, it takes longer than 2 seconds for the color to return (a sign of circulatory collapse) The dog may also have distressed or laboured breathing. He breathes more quickly (normal is below 35 to 40 breaths per minute) and takes shallower breaths than usual.  , Untreated, your dog may deteriorate, find it difficult to walk, and slump to the ground. As his abdomen becomes increasingly swollen, blood return to the heart is impaired by pressure from the stomach (which compresses the aorta and vena cava, much like putting your foot on a hosepipe) and the dog goes into circulatory collapse.

"['continue to brush and floss', 'let it fall out on its own', 'use over the counter pain medication or a topical gel', ""make sure you're eating well"", 'take care of adult teeth grow that in irregularly']",How to Take Care of Your Loose Teeth1," Even though it’s tempting to slack on oral hygiene when you have loose baby teeth, it’s important to take care of both your old and new teeth. Continue a normal brushing and flossing routine, and use mouthwash to rinse away any food particles that might get caught underneath your loose tooth. Otherwise, you run the risk of letting bacteria grow between your teeth and in any gaps under the loose tooth. This could lead to painful infections, or cause your adult tooth to decay as it grows under your loose baby tooth.It’s good to be extra gentle about brushing around the loose tooth or teeth, especially if your gums are sore. If you have a really loose tooth, then you can even harm the inner ligaments of your tooth if you use too much pressure. You don’t need to be too careful with baby teeth, however. They’re meant to fall out when the time is right, so you don’t have to baby them too much. If you are concerned, then you can always check on the age ranges for when a baby tooth is supposed to fall out, such as by asking your dentist or searching the internet.; , You should encourage the tooth to come out on its own by wiggling it and going about your normal routines. However, you don’t want to force it out, so don’t yank it out or chomp right down on really hard food. Your baby tooth will come out when it’s ready once the root holding it in has completely dissolved leaving room for the permanent tooth to come out.Removing a baby tooth before it’s ready can lead to infection, pain, and bleeding. It can also lead to eruption disorders of the permanent teeth. There could still be some root left and bacteria will grow in it.  , Losing baby teeth is usually painless, but sometimes they can have sharp edges that dig into gums as they wiggle. Adult teeth can also cause sore gums as they erupt. If you’re experiencing sore gums or any discomfort as your baby teeth fall out and your adult teeth grow in, ask a parent for kid-friendly pain medication.Ibuprofen or a gel that gently numbs your gums can help with teething pain, but if it gets worse you should go to a pediatric dentist.  , Chewing food when baby teeth are loose and with adult teeth growing in can be uncomfortable or painful. Even if you have a sore mouth, it’s important to keep up a good, well-balanced diet. Try eating vegetable soups, pureed fruits, and drink plenty of milk so your body stays strong while your teeth grow.Get more calcium in your diet, such as by drinking milk and eating yogurt and cheese. However, don’t worry about supplementing with fluoride as long as you use a fluoride toothpaste two times a day. This will prevent any enamel defects such as hypomineralization or fluorosis.  , Sometimes, adult teeth grow in behind baby teeth before they fall out, making a double row of teeth. This isn’t a major cause for concern, just make sure you take extra care to brush between the two sets of teeth. This will help remove plaque and bacteria that can grow in the space between them.Visit a dentist if you don’t lose the baby tooth or teeth in front of the adult tooth after three months.

There are three basic types of birdfeeders: ground, hanging, and window. To look at each type and make an informed decision, visit a local pet-supply store or birdwatching store, and speak with the sales staff.Ground feeders are planted in the ground and allow squirrels and chipmunks to access the food, in addition to birds. Hanging feeders can be suspended from overhanging tree branches. Window feeders attach to the wall of your house, outside of a window. This is probably the most practical type of feeder to use when hanging a feeder for your cats to watch.; , When deciding where to hang the feeder, choose a location near a window that birds can access easily. Find a window that’s at least 10 feet (3 meters) off of the ground on the outside of the house, as this height will keep the feeder safe from squirrels, foxes, or outdoor cats.To make sure that your cats will be able to see and observe the bird feeder, it’s important that, inside the house, the window is accessible to your cats. You should also make sure that this area is easy for you to access, because you will need to tend to the feeder regularly in order to refill and clean it.  , Once you’ve decided on a window to hang the birdfeeder in front of, make sure that the external window screen is secure and that the window itself closes tightly. By doing this, you’ll ensure that your cats won’t be able to press on the window and open it. Securing the screen will also ensure that birds won’t scratch or peck at it.Additionally, if you have children in the house, it would be wise to ask them not to open the window near the feeder. This will prevent birds from flying from the feeder directly into your house.  , When hanging an outdoor feeder, it’s a common problem for birds to fly into the window, mistaking the clear glass for open sky. To avoid this problem and spare birds’ lives, tape a bird-shaped silhouette on the window. This will deter birds from flying into the glass. Alternatively, you can hang a reflector to the outside surface of the glass; birds will see this and avoid flying into the window.Visit your local pet-supply shop, or a store dedicated to selling birdwatching products. Ask the sales staff what they recommend you put in your windows to prevent birds from flying into them.  , Although ground feeders come in a variety of models, most of them are attached to the top of a sturdy metal pole, which simply needs to be stabbed into the soil. Other models are made of wood or plastic and have a flat base or four legs, and can be placed on the ground. Set up your ground feeder on a flat patch of land near a window from which your cats can look out.  Be aware that, when feeding birds with a ground feeder, you’ll also attract a number of chipmunks, squirrels, and other small rodents. If you don’t want to attract these types of animals, ask a sales person at your local pet supply store to recommend a type of feeder that deters rodents.  , This variety of feeder is composed of the hanging feeder and a rope attached to the top. You need to find a large overhanging branch that’s near enough to your house that your cats can see it from a window. Then, using a ladder, climb up to the branch and tie the rope securely around the branch. Make sure that your hanging feeder is suspended at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) off the ground, so squirrels cannot jump up to it.Use safety precautions when climbing a ladder to attach the tie-rope. Never lean a ladder against a weak or dead branch. Have a friend or family member hold the base of the ladder for stability.  , These feeders typically have 2 or 3 large suction cups attached to the back, which you can stick to your window. Attach the feeder by dampening the suction cups (this will make them more adhesive) and sticking them firmly to the glass of a window. Hang the feeder low on the window so cats can easily see it, but so that it won’t obstruct your own view.  If you need to use a ladder to access a second- or third-floor window, have someone stand below you and stabilize the legs of the ladder.  , Of course, to attract birds, you’ll need to fill the feeder with seeds. Most types of bird seed are blends of grains: they commonly include sunflower seeds and millet, which appeal to a variety of bird species. Once you’ve filled the feeder, birds may be slow to start coming at first. However, as more and more birds discover your feeder, it may become quite crowded.Speak with the sales staff at a birdwatching store, and ask which types of seed they recommend to attract various types of birds in your area.  , The frequency with which you refill the bird feeder depends on how quickly the birds empty it, and how often you’re willing to pay for seed. If you refill the seeder as soon as the birds finish the seed, you may find yourself replenishing the seed a couple of times each week.However, if you let the feeder stay empty for too long or refill it infrequently, fewer and fewer birds will come back to the feeder.  , Once birds start to come to your outdoor feeder, you’ll need to show your cats the feeder and the birds. The outdoor bird feeder won’t do your cats any good if the pets don’t know of the feeder’s existence or location. Pick up your cats and bring them to the window overlooking the bird feeder. If there are birds at the feeder, this should arouse your cats’ curiosity.  If your cats have already discovered the bird feeder and are curious about the birds, you may not need to show your cats the feeder.  , This will give your cats an easy access point from which they can observe the birds.Depending on the height of the windowsill, a relatively low piece of furniture should do, such as a chest-high bookshelf or a low dresser. If the cats are unable to leap up to the window, they won’t be able to observe the birds at the feeder.  Alternately, if the window which overlooks the bird feeder has a sill large enough for the cats to comfortably rest on, you may only need to position furniture so that the cats have easy access to the windowsill. Move a chair or low table, so your cats can leap from that to the windowsill.  , Once your cats have found out about the bird feeder, they should enjoy regularly overlooking the birds and watching them fly and eat. However, your cats may also try to escape and run out to the feeder, where they will likely try to catch the birds. To prevent this, make sure that your cats don’t run outside.  Be careful when opening doors that lead outside, especially with your cats nearby. You can use your feet or body to block the door when you’re walking outside, or set up a gate across the opening of the door when you exit.

"[""don't be embarrassed"", 'keep it simple', 'try a pre-made note online', 'ask to talk to a female you both trust', ""ask him to schedule a doctor's appointment for you"", 'talk to someone else']",How to Tell Your Parents You Started Your Period2," Remember, menstruation happens to all girls; in fact, it even happens to some female animals. The important thing to remember is that the apprehension you are feeling will lessen over time.Know that your dad is mature enough to handle ""the period talk."" As an adult male, your dad not only knows what a period is, but has probably been expecting to have this talk with you for some time. Your dad may be slightly embarrassed as well. Take comfort in knowing that you're not the only one trying to get a handle on your emotions. Understand that your reaction is a normal one. Starting your period can be both confusing and emotional.  , Sometimes the easiest way to approach the situation is to just say, ""Dad, I got my period."" Keeping it brief and to the point will help you to avoid becoming emotional. Instead of building up to a big sit down conversation, try approaching the subject during down time such as when watching television or eating dinner.   By being direct, you avoid confusion and open the lines of communication between you and your dad. Your openness may ease his discomfort and he may become a valuable resource for information., Sometimes it's easier to write words than to speak them. But what happens if you can't find the right words to say or write? There are scripted notes online that can be addressed to anyone and that allow you to ease into the topic. With titles like ""guess what"" or ""we need to talk"" it sends a clear message to dad without the awkward talk.The great thing about this option is that it informs your parent, but puts the responsibility of initiating the conversation on them.Be sure to put the note in a place where your dad is sure to find it, and make sure he'll find it at an appropriate time. Giving the note to him when he's running out of the house for work isn't the best option.  , Sometimes it's just easier to talk to a female about female problems. If you don't have a mother or older sister around, tell your dad that you need to speak to a female about ""female issues"" you are experiencing.   Your dad may become curious or worried at this point. You can ease his curiosity by simply stating ""I started my period and I would rather talk to a woman about it."" You can make your dad feel like part of the process by asking for his advice about who to go to for help., As someone who is in charge of your healthcare, your dad will probably ask why you need to visit the doctor. At this point you can inform him that you are having a personal issue. This will either open the door to further communication or give your dad a clue that something is going on.   Your doctor is not only a great source of information, but they can also assist you in telling your dad about your period.A close alternative is the school nurse. You can always get feminine products from your school nurse while you're figuring out how to tell your dad. But don't hide it from him for too long. It is definitely something for which you don't have to be ashamed.  , What happens if your dad isn't someone you can trust or if he is embarrassed by the situation? You can always choose to confide in a trusted confidant like a family friend, relative, or a trusted neighbor.","['doctor', 'appointment', 'pre-made note online', 'someone', 'trust']"

You should take color photographs or video of your livestock. Make sure that your photographs or video show the full extent of the injury.   Also note any damage to your property. Someone might have released your livestock by damaging your fence. You want to document that as well.; , If you saw your livestock getting injured, you should write down your memories as soon as possible. By writing your memories down, you can remember them better. Also, you can refer to your notes at a later date to remind you of what happened.   Be sure to include all relevant details. If you saw a person harming your livestock, describe their appearance: height, weight, what the person was wearing, etc. If a dog attacked your livestock, write down a description of the dog: breed, size, color, and any distinguishing characteristics.  , You should call a vet to come out to your place and check your livestock. The vet can treat your livestock and save their lives. Even more, the vet’s records will come in handy when you file a lawsuit, since the records are proof of the injury.   Hold onto the vet’s bills. You can be compensated for any veterinarian treatments needed to treat the injury., In many states, injuring livestock intentionally is a crime.Because it is a crime, if your livestock have been injured, you need to contact the police. If the police find the individual responsible and prosecutors press charges, they may be found guilty and sentenced to jail time. In addition, they may have to pay fines.   If the person responsible is found guilty of a crime, it will also help your civil case. Therefore, it is important to contact the police and pursue criminal charges when possible.  , You might not immediately know who is responsible for your livestock’s injury. However, in order to bring a lawsuit, you need to identify someone as the defendant. Accordingly, you should ask neighbors if they saw anyone around the livestock and ask if they know the person’s identity. You also might want to call the police to investigate.   The defendant might have harmed your livestock directly. For example, if someone shot your horse, then he is responsible for the injury. Typically, you will rely on eyewitness testimony that someone directly harmed your livestock. The defendant might also have hurt your livestock indirectly. For example, if someone broke into your barn and left the door open, then he could be legally responsible if your animals escape and are injured. To help prove this kind of indirect injury, you should take photographs of your barn and the broken door. Also gather evidence of how close the road is to your barn. If the barn is close to the road, then a reasonable person should know that livestock would wander out to the highway if the barn door was left open. A defendant’s dog might also have hurt your livestock.The owner is responsible for an injury caused by his or her dog. You will typically rely on eyewitness testimony that the dog attacked your livestock.  , You should meet with an attorney before filing your lawsuit. In particular, you will want to discuss whether bringing a lawsuit is worthwhile. You can certainly sue for an injury, no matter how small. However, lawsuits are time-consuming, and you might not want to bother with a lawsuit if the injuries were not serious.To find a lawyer, you should contact your local or state bar association, which should run a referral program. After you get a referral, schedule a consultation with the lawyer. At the consultation, you can talk with the lawyer about your case. The lawyer might also give you pointers if you decide to represent yourself in court.  , There aren't any federal laws protecting livestock from injury.Therefore, you will have to sue under your state's livestock laws. However, you may still be able to file in federal court if you have diversity jurisdiction. To have diversity jurisdiction, you and the other party must be citizens of different states and the amount in controversy must be greater than $75,000.State courts can hear almost any case involving events that took place in that state. Think about the following when deciding where to file your case:Which courthouse is closer to you Which court has more favorable court rules Which court has more favorable judges Which court will have better jury pools  , If your lawsuit isn’t worth much money, you might want to sue in small claims. Small claims court has a maximum that you can sue for, which depends on your state. Typically, the maximum ranges from $5,000 to $10,000.If you choose small claims court, then you don’t need a lawyer. It is set up so that people can represent themselves. Many small claims courts also have non-traditional hours, which allow you to attend court in the evening or on weekends. However, some small claims courts don’t allow juries.And some don’t allow you to appeal if you lose your lawsuit. If having a jury or the right to appeal is important to you, then you might want to file your lawsuit in regular civil court.  , You start a lawsuit by filing a “complaint” with the court. A complaint identifies you and the defendant and explains the factual circumstances surrounding the livestock injury. In your complaint, you also ask the court for money damages as compensation.If you have a lawyer, he or she will draft a complaint and file it. Be sure to ask your lawyer for a copy of all documents filed in your case. Many courts now have printed “fill in the blank” complaint forms for you to use. If you are representing yourself, then stop into your court clerk’s office and ask for a form. If no form is available, then ask if they have a sample that you could use as a guide. If no sample is available, then think about hiring a lawyer.  , You should provide all requested information. Print neatly, using black ink. Alternately, you could enter the information with a typewriter. Each complaint form differs, but you will generally be asked for the same information:your name and address the defendant’s name and address how much you are suing for the facts surrounding the dispute (“who, what, when, where”)  , After you have finished the complaint, you should make several copies. Take the copies, along with the original, to the court clerk’s office. Ask to file the original.The clerk should stamp your copies with the date. Keep one copy for your records. You will serve another copy on the defendant. If there is more than one defendant, then each defendant gets a copy. You will probably have to pay a filing fee. The amount will vary by court. Call ahead to ask the court clerk the amount and acceptable methods of payment. If you can’t afford the fee, you may qualify for a fee waiver. Ask the clerk for a fee waiver form and fill it out., You have to give the defendant a copy of your complaint. The court clerk will also help you get a “summons,” which is a legal document commanding the defendant to respond to your lawsuit. You should ask the court clerk what are acceptable methods of service. Generally, you can make service in the following ways:Have the forms hand-delivered by anyone 18 or older who is not a party to the case. You cannot make service yourself. Pay to have the sheriff or a private process server hand-deliver the papers on the defendant. Mail the papers to the defendant. Someone (not you) should mail the papers first-class or certified mail to the defendant’s home address or, if the defendant is a business, then to the defendant’s business address.  , The person who makes service also has to prove that they made service. They can do this by filling out and signing a proof of service or affidavit of service. You can get this form from the court clerk and give it to the server.   After filling out the proof of service, the server returns the signed form to you. You must then file it with the court.Always keep a copy of every form you file with the court.  , After you serve the other party with the lawsuit and they respond, you will enter a period of discovery, which is a time to collect and exchange information about the case. Discovery can be time consuming and expensive. The process can take months, or even years, and it can often take up a majority of the case budget. During discovery you will gather facts, speak with witnesses, collect documents, and assess the case. You will do these things by utilizing the following discovery tools:   Informal discovery, which will include interviewing witnesses, collecting public documents, and taking photographs. Interrogatories, which are written questions that will be answered under oath. These can be used in court. Depositions, which are formal interviews with relevant individuals. They are taken under oath and the answers can be used in court. Requests for documents, which are used when you want access to documents that are not publicly available (e.g., emails, text messages, internal memos). Subpoenas, which are court orders requiring people to produce documents or answer questions., Throughout the legal process you (or your attorney) will be responsible for attending various pre-trial conferences. These conferences keep the judge apprised of updates. Some conferences will be about scheduling. Other conferences will help foster agreements (a.k.a., stipulations)., Once you have a good idea about how your case is likely to proceed (i.e., after discovery), the defendant may file a motion for summary judgment. In their motion, which will include affidavits and supporting evidence, they will try to show the judge that there are no disputed material facts and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   In other words, a judge will analyze their motion and make every factual assumption in your favor. Therefore, to defend the motion, all you have to do is provide evidence and affidavits that show the judge there are disputed issues. If you can do so, you will defeat the motion and move forward with your case., In a last effort to avoid trial, you should try to settle the case with the other party. To do so, sit down with the opposite side and discuss your concerns. Let them know what you need and why you need it. In return, the other party will tell you what they expect and why they believe what they believe. If you can find some common ground and find areas of agreement, you may be able to settle the case.  , You shouldn’t be late to your trial. The judge can dismiss the lawsuit if you are late. Plan to arrive at least fifteen minutes early so that you can find parking and pass through courthouse security.   Remember to dress professionally. You should look like you are going to a professional job interview.Do not bring food into the courtroom. You should also turn off all electronic devices before entering.  , If you have a lawyer, then your lawyer can handle the entire trial. You would then possibly testify and offer your advice to your lawyer, but your lawyer will handle all of the nuts and bolts of the trial. However, if you are representing yourself, then you will need to make an opening statement.   The purpose of the opening statement is to provide a sneak peek of your evidence. You shouldn’t argue or draw conclusions.Instead, simply tell the judge what you will show during the trial: that your livestock was injured and that the defendant took some action that caused the injury. For example, you could say, “As the evidence will show, at 5:30 pm on August 22, 2015, my neighbor, Allison Smith, heard barking coming from my property. And as the evidence will also show, Mrs. Smith watched as a 100-pound pit bull bit into a horse's leg.”  , Your evidence will consist of witnesses and documents. For example, you can introduce photographs taken of your livestock. You could also call the veterinarian as a witness.   If you don’t have a lawyer, then you should have written out a list of questions to ask the witness ahead of time. Remember to stick to the focus of the trial—what happened to your livestock and who injured them. You can only have people testify to what they saw or heard first-hand.Witnesses can’t testify to rumors, nor can they guess. For example, you can ask a neighbor if she saw a dog attack your livestock. But she can’t testify that someone told her whose dog it was. For more tips, see Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself.  , You may testify at trial as well. You can only testify about events that you have personal knowledge of. For example, if you saw the defendant hurt your livestock, you can testify as to what you saw and heard. To be an effective witness, remember the following:Listen closely to the question and only answer the question asked. Don’t volunteer extra information. Never answer a question you don’t understand. Ask the lawyer to clarify or rephrase. Always tell the truth. It is against the law to lie, and you will only hurt yourself if you are less than truthful. Never argue with a lawyer. Always project calmness.  , If the defendant has witnesses testify, then you or your lawyer will be able to ask questions during cross-examination. You should listen closely to what the witness says.   The defendant might testify, so you can cross-examine him. You should try to get helpful information from the defendant. For example, if the defendant’s dog injured your livestock, then you will want to get the owner to admit that he owns the dog. You can show him a picture of the dog and ask him whose dog is shown in the photograph. The witness should admit that it is his dog. You can use the same picture with all witnesses. For example, your neighbor might look at the picture and identify the dog as the one that attacked your livestock.  , After all evidence has been presented, you will need to deliver a closing argument. Your goal is to draw together all of the evidence to show that the defendant is responsible for the injury to your livestock.   Remind the judge of specific pieces of evidence. Your trial might have been spread over a couple days, and people can forget evidence submitted early in the trial. For example, you could say, “As you remember, you heard testimony from Mrs. Smith that a pit bull, about 100 pounds, started attacking the horse. And she identified the dog in this picture as the dog that attacked the horse.”  , If you have a jury, then the judge will read the jury its instructions before they retire to deliberate. If a judge is deciding your case, then he or she will probably deliver a ruling immediately from the bench.   In many states, you can win a lawsuit without a unanimous jury.You can typically win if at least three-fourths or five-sixths of the jurors agree with you.If your jury has 12 members, only nine or 10 would need to decide in your favor.

"['review your credit card bills', 'try to resolve the issue with the merchant', 'learn your rights as a consumer', 'learn the restrictions on chargeback claims and defenses']",How to Resolve a Credit Card Dispute1," You should carefully look over your statement every month to catch any instances of fraud or unauthorized charges. You may also be able to check your statement online, which can help you stay on top of your account on a daily or weekly basis. If you have a debit card, you should also check your online checking account balance on a regular basis.Save your receipts. You'll need your receipt in case you need to return an item, and having a receipt may help you cross-check how an item was rung up at the register.; , Whether you were over-charged for an item, rung up more than once for the same item, or believe you've been the victim of credit card fraud, contacting the merchant may be a useful first step. Some merchants are willing to work with customers to resolve credit card disputes in-store.In cases where a customer disputes the quality or condition of goods/services, the customer may even be required to make an effort to resolve the issue with the merchant before initiating a charge dispute with the credit card company, which emphasizes the importance of alerting the merchant as soon as possible.Be polite and courteous. Remember that it may not be the merchant's fault, especially in the case of fraud. Be polite and respectful, and you're likely to get a better reaction than customers who are angry and demanding.Even if you try to resolve the issue with the merchant, you should also let your credit card issuer know about the discrepancy. This is because in the case of fraud, the abuse may have originated within the store where the unauthorized charge took place., If a charge discrepancy arises, you have certain rights under the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA). However, some merchants may try to limit those rights. Some online retailers, for example, have sales policies that restrict a customer's right to dispute charges, and threaten to add list disputing customers on a chargeback abuser database. This violates both the FCBA and the user policies that most major credit card companies have in place.Consumers have the right to dispute any billing errors, erroneous charges, or fraudulent charges. Under the FCBA, credit card companies may not harm a consumer's credit or threaten to do so for refusing to pay disputed charges while the charges in question are being investigated. Credit card companies can not demand payment of disputed charges while those charges are being investigated. Credit card companies are also forbidden from filing a collection lawsuit against the consumer while a charge is being disputed. Consumers have a right to withhold payment for incomplete or unsatisfactory services until the claim is investigated and a decision is reached by the credit card company. A consumer wishing to stop payment must inform the credit card company of his desire to do so, and must be willing to make the payment if the investigation determines that the consumer was still responsible for making that payment. It is expected that the consumer will attempt to resolve the dispute with the party or parties who performed the unsatisfactory/incomplete services. The FCBA requires all disputed transactions to be investigated and resolved as quickly as possible, and is designed to protect consumers against fraud and abuse., Disputing a charge under the defense of ""claims and defenses"" allows you to notify the bank that issued your credit card of the unauthorized charge up to one year from the date of the statement that outlined that charge. If you meet the qualifications for a claims and defenses dispute, you may be eligible for a chargeback. But a chargeback, which is the reversal of a charge determined to be unauthorized, has certain limits and restrictions of its own. Knowing those restrictions is just as important as knowing your rights.The amount in dispute must be in excess of $50.If you have already paid your credit card debt down to zero, you can no longer dispute an unauthorized charge under the defense of ""claims and defenses"". If you have only paid back a portion of your bill, you may still dispute the remaining balance that you haven't yet paid.The disputed transaction cannot be with a merchant more than 100 miles from your residence or outside your state of residence. If, for example, you purchase an item with your credit card while on vacation out of state and realize upon returning home that the box was empty or contained the wrong item, you still have 60 days to notify your bank and exercise your ""billing errors"" rights. But because the item was purchased outside the covered region for claims and defenses, if you miss the 60 day window you are not eligible to file a claims and defenses dispute.You must make a good faith attempt at securing a refund or store credit from the merchant before you can dispute the charge with the bank that issued the credit card. Sending a written correspondence or a notice of cancellation to the merchant qualifies as an attempt at securing a refund or store credit.Be prepared for the possibility that a customer service representative may not be familiar with ""claims and defenses"" rights, and may attempt to refuse your dispute if more than 60 days have passed. In this case you should make it clear, either in your letter or through your phone correspondence, that you are invoking your ""claims and defenses"" rights under state and federal law, and that those rights are not limited to the 60 day restriction that ""billing error"" rights are.","['chargeback claims', 'rights', 'restrictions', 'defenses', 'consumer', 'credit card bills', 'issue', 'merchant']"

He can also recommend products and treatments that you can try to help clear up your skin., There are many, many products on the market (face washes, creams, pads, etc.) meant to help fight against acne, and it can be really hard to know which one will work best for you. These usually contain an active ingredient to help fight your acne. If you purchase a cleanser or other product that contains salicylic acid, but it doesn’t seem to be working after a few months of use, then try switching to another acne fighting ingredient.   Benzoyl peroxide is an ingredient that helps kill bacteria and keep pores clean; however, it is recommended that you not use a cleanser that has more than 2.5%. When washing your face, let it sit on the skin for about 15 seconds before rinsing. This way, it will have enough time to penetrate your pores.You can also use pads or leave-on creams with 2.5% to 10% benzoyl peroxide. Salicylic acid is another common acne fighting ingredient. It works by helping get rid of dead skin cells on the skin, which often trap bacteria, causing breakouts. Salicylic acid is available in cleansers and other leave-on products. Products containing retinoids can help fight acne, especially blackheads and whiteheads. Most retinoids are available by prescription, but you can get some (such as adapalene gel) over-the-counter. Apply retinoids at night as they can make your skin sensitive to the sun, and be aware you may experience dryness and slight irritation at first. Tea tree oil is a natural product which can also work great for getting rid of pimples; however, be aware that it may not work as quickly as some other products, but is great if you prefer to stick with natural ingredients. You can buy this either as an oil, which you can dab on a pimple, or there are also washes that include tea tree oil you can use as a cleanser., A multi-step will typically include a cleanser meant to wash away dirt and all of the pore-clogging things your face encounters throughout the day, a toner to swipe away any leftover dirt and/or dead skin cells, a spot treatment for the pimples you have, and, in many cases, a moisturizer.These multi-step systems are often sold together in one box, and may be the best option for mild to moderate acne sufferers because not only do they cleanse the skin, they help clear up the conditions that cause acne in the first place.  , Although it is very tempting when you have a big, pus-filled pimple on your face, do whatever you can to keep yourself from popping it. Popping pimples can lead to even more pimples, redness, inflammation, and even scarring that you might have to deal with for the rest of your life.If you are very focused on a pimple, try dabbing some tea tree oil on it. This way, you will feel like you’ve done something to deal with it, but you haven’t actually popped it. If you do pop a pimple, put a spot treatment on the pimple to disinfect it. These usually contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. You could also use tea tree oil, which is a natural disinfectant.  , Every single night, before you go to sleep, you should wash your face. Wash your face again when you get up in the morning. Do not wash your face using hand soap or shampoo! These types of soaps are formulated for a different type of skin, on a different part of your body and are unlikely to help the problem.Splash some lukewarm water on your face and neck to get it wet. Squeeze a pea-size amount of your chosen cleanser into your hand, and smooth it all over your face. Use the tips of your fingers to gently rub your skin. Remember to get along your hairline and neck, too! Rinse and dry. After you have cleansed, you need to rinse very thoroughly. Make sure that you get all of the cleanser off of your face. Gently pat your face dry with a clean towel. Don’t rub your face! This can irritate your skin more. If you are using a multi-step system, be sure to follow the instructions carefully, and apply all of the steps in order, each time you use the products.  , After cleansing, it is important to apply a good moisturizer. If you suffer from breakouts, try an oil-free moisturizer.You don’t need to overdo it here, just apply a thin layer all of your face and neck. Applying too much could clog your pores. You should also apply moisturizer in the morning after rinsing, but before applying any other products. Try a moisturizer with sunscreen for daytime use.  , A new skin care routine will not fix all of your problems overnight. Once you get into your new routine, stick with it! It will take about six weeks for a new product to start working on your skin, so use it every day, and hopefully you will see results soon.  , If you wear makeup, make sure to clean your makeup brushes every few weeks to remove any bacteria and old makeup that has built up.   You can clean your brushes at home by first rinsing the brushes under running, lukewarm water. Fill a small bowl with about one quarter cup of lukewarm water and mix in 1 teaspoon of baby shampoo. Swirl the bristles of your brush around in the soapy water, and use your fingers to gently massage the soapy water into the brush. Rinse the bristles thoroughly under running, lukewarm water. Pat the brush dry using a clean dry cloth, and then allow the brush to dry completely. Lay the brush on a counter top with the bristles hanging over the edge so that air can circulate throughout the brush.  , Lots of girls like to do each others makeup at sleepovers; however, if you do this and you share makeup with your friends, you could also be sharing lots of bacteria with each other. This can lead to problems with acne, and maybe even worse. Therefore, you should never ever share any of your makeup with your friends.   If you do like to do each other’s makeup, then bring your own makeup with you.  , Using a face mask once every week or two will help to exfoliate your skin and remove any build up in your skin. You can make your own mask, or you can buy one from the drugstore.   You could also ask an older sibling or your mom if they have a bottle of face mask that you could borrow if you don’t have any money to buy it. A good acne-fighting mask can be made by mixing 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, one tablespoon of honey, one egg white, and a drop or two of an essential oil such as lavender or rosemary in a bowl. Mix the ingredients well, smooth the mask onto your face, let it sit for 15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Finish by applying an oil-free moisturizer.  , The products and tools that are used during a facial open up your pores better than you can at home, which allows for the extraction of blackheads and dirt that are building up inside your pores.   Many spas offer programs designed specifically for teens, which may be shorter and/or less expensive.  , When we sleep, all of the oils on our skin tend to get into our sheets, this includes any bacteria and dirt we might have missed when washing. Therefore, it is important that you keep your sheets clean, especially your pillowcase. Try to wash your pillowcase in the washing machine at least once a week.   If your parents find this strange, try to politely explain to them that you are having trouble with pimples, and you want to do anything you can to get rid of them, including keeping your bedding clean. Although this may seem like a hassle, it might make a huge difference, and sleeping on fresh sheets can often be very enjoyable.  , It may be easier said than done, but try not to let yourself get too worked up about things, this includes your skin. Stress can lead to breakouts, so if you’re feeling stressed do something you enjoy to help you relax.Read a book, watch some TV, or go outside for a walk or run.  , Green tea is thought to be very good at fighting acne from the inside out. It has many antioxidants which aid in digestion and reduce inflammation.Don’t add sugar to your green tea if you can avoid it. This may counteract its benefits. If you need a bit of sweetener, try adding a small drop of honey. You can also try adding ice to your green tea.  , This can be whatever you want, whether it be yoga, swimming, running, walking, or playing basketball. Anything that gets you up and moving, and hopefully sweating a bit too.   Sweat can help keep your pores clean, and exercise can help reduce stress that may lead to breakouts.After exercising, you can take a shower to rinse the sweat off.  , What is happening on our skin can be a good health indicator. A lack of sleep can cause higher levels of stress.Make sure that you get at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night!  , Though it may not have a huge impact, there is some research that suggests that those who consume more dairy, are more likely to suffer from breakouts.If you normally drink a lot of milk, or eat a lot of yogurt, ice cream, and/or cheese, try reducing this amount as much as possible.   It’s ok to enjoy an ice cream every once in awhile, but eating or drinking dairy every day or every two days may increase your risk of breakouts. Talk to your doctor before you cut back too much on dairy — there are vitamins and minerals in dairy products that are essential to your health. Your doctor can help you strategize to make sure you get these vitamins elsewhere.  , Sugary sweets have also been linked to problems with acne. This can be tough, but if you are eating a chocolate bar or other candy every day, cut it out. Not only is it not good for you, and can cause health problems if you eat it too much, it may be causing those pimples on your face too.Again, remember that all things can be enjoyed every now and then. This isn’t a suggestion that you should never touch a piece of chocolate again. When you do eat some candy, really enjoy it. If you enjoy chocolate, try having a small piece of dark chocolate, which has antioxidants that are actually good for you (in small amounts).For example, if you buy a dark chocolate bar that is 100 grams, limit yourself to about a quarter of it (25 grams) at any one time.  , Refined carbohydrates are carbohydrates that have been processed. This means that this nutrient doesn’t exist in nature.While foods that have refined carbohydrates in them are usually very tasty, they are also very unhealthy, and may be another reason you are having a breakout.There are many foods that have refined carbohydrates. For example, ice cream, white bread, cookies, cakes, crackers, bagels, pretzels, pizza, chips, etc. This is only a small sample of foods that contain refined carbohydrates. Basically, if a food has been processed (e.g. comes in a package on a shelf in a grocery store), it likely contains these refined carbs. Don’t worry too much though! You can still enjoy a slice of pizza every now and then, but try to stick with eating fresh foods, such as fruits and vegetables as much as possible.  , Most people don’t drink enough water, and dehydration has numerous negative health effects; however, drinking water is also good for keeping skin clear because it helps to flush toxins from the body and increase circulation. Though research has not found a direct link between water consumption and acne, drinking more water helps boost blood flow to the skin.The amount of water needed by a girl between the ages of nine and 12 is about seven glasses, or 1.5 liters.If you are 13 or over, this number goes up to eight to 10 glasses, or 2 liters.","['water', 'morning', 'ingredients', 'face mask', 'drink green tea', 'stress', 'skin', 'acne', 'spa', 'drink plenty', 'intake', 'makeup', 'face', 'monthly facials', 'refined carbohydrates', 'use clean makeup brushes', 'bed sheets', 'sugary foods', 'dairy products', 'multi-step acne-fighting system', 'bed', 'pimples', 'dermatologist']"
"['hunt eidolon spawns in guild halls', 'hunt for mini-bosses', 'clear otherworld-port skandia dungeon']",How to Hunt Eidolon in Aura Kingdom3," You can get Key Fragments by hunting Guild Eidolon spawn during certain times. Every day, the Guild summons different kinds of Eidolons that players can kill. All who inflict damage on the boss will be given a reward, or if you're using a support character, being in a party will give you the same chance.    Eidolon Guild Spawns  Eidolon Time (EST) Notes   Kotonoha Monday - 12PM, 5PM, and 10PM Kotonoha wields powerful esoteric spells with ease, can recover your health, and will enable you to move faster. Quite ideal for Muses and Wizards.   Quelkulan Tuesday - 1AM, 3PM, and 8PM An electric element, Quelkulan too can recover allies’ health and remove negative statuses.   Aelius Tuesday - 12PM, 5PM, and 10PM Aelius is a Knight of the Sun, wielding fire property. He can help increase your defense, evasion, and accuracy.   Bel-Chandra Wednesday - 12PM, 5PM, and 10PM Bel-Chandra is proficient in all the dances, an Empress of Torment who wields electric property. Bel-Chandra increases the party's crit rate and crit damage. She also decreases the enemy's evasion.   Yarnaros Thursday - 1AM, 3PM, and 8PM Yarnaros wields the storm property. His attack skills cause devastating storm damage that may stun the enemy.   Gigas Thursday - 12PM, 5PM, and 10PM Gigas' skill attack may decrease the enemy's attack speed and accuracy. One of his skills inflicts lightning damage that stuns enemies.   Bahadur Friday - 1AM, 3PM, and 8PM Bahadur wields fire property. He increases your speed and critical chance.   Sigrun Friday - 12PM, 5PM, and 10PM An ice element, Sigrun can recover your health and stun enemies.   Tigerius Saturday - 1AM, 3PM, and 8PM Tigerus is an electric, or lightning, wielder. This Eidolon is good for Bards and tanks for luring because of the added speed.   Uzuriel Saturday - 12PM, 5PM, and 10PM Uzuriel wields the storm property and has skills that can decrease the enemy's defense and their evasion ability.   Vayu Sunday - 1AM, 3PM, and 8PM Wielding light property, Vayu is usually teamed up with tanks, such as Guardians or Berserkers. This is not a good Eidolon for Bards.   Eligos Sunday - 12PM, 5PM, and 10PM Eligos wields dark property. He inflects damage over time, boosts your Crit rate, and also increases your damage. His AoE ultimate is good for dungeon runs.   To get inside a Guild Hall, you need to be in a high level Guild. Remember, every Eidolon gives buffs or added damage depending on the job class of their owner.  , On every map, there are a couple of mini-bosses you can kill. Upon killing them, you will be able to pick up an urn to be brought back to the town. Trade it with the guard for a bounty box. Each box may contain Eidolon Key Fragments at random, but the chances are quite slim.   To hunt a mini-boss, just check your map and look for any mini-boss icon, indicating its location. Take note that mini-bosses spawn at different times but in the same place.  , Skandia can be entered when you reach level 50. Access portal for this dungeon is in Cacaktara map. Eidolons randomly appear in this dungeon. Defeating appeared eidolons can drop eidolons fragments or keys sometimes. Whenever you clear Skandia, you will be rewarded with Loyalty Points.   Loyalty Points can be used to buy Eidolon key fragments in Item Mall although they're quite expensive, ranging from 500 to 2,600 Loyalty Points per key fragment, depending on the Eidolon's level. In this dungeon, random Eidolon may spawn. You can kill Eidolon spawns for randomly dropped Eidolon Keys and Fragments; however, Eidolons spawning in Skandia is rare.

Reasons for FMLA leave include the birth of a child, a serious medical condition that renders the employee unable to work, or the need to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition. You can use the DOL's FMLA fact sheet to satisfy this requirement. This fact sheet is available for download at http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.htm. The DOL also has an employee guide that explains the FMLA and answers some frequently asked questions about eligibility, rights, and benefits. You can download the guide at http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/employeeguide.pdf. Either you or the employee may choose to substitute accrued paid leave in place of FMLA leave. If you require such a substitution to be made, this requirement should be included in your employee handbook.; , Because employees aren't required to indicate they are requesting leave under FMLA, your supervisory employees need to know what the FMLA covers and how to recognize those requests.Go over forms and required notices in detail so managers and supervisors know how to provide notice as required by FMLA, and the deadlines for providing that notice. Your managers and supervisors should know how to calculate the 12-month leave year for FMLA purposes. As an employer you can choose one of four methods, but you must apply the method you choose consistently – you can't choose one method for some employees and a different one for others.Generally, you may measure the 12-month period by using the calendar year, a fixed 12-month ""leave year"" period, a 12-month period measured from the date of an employee's first FMLA leave period begins, or a period measured from the first date an employees uses any FMLA leave.  , The DOL has posters providing basic information about employee rights under the FMLA that must be displayed in all covered workplaces.The poster explains the provisions of the FMLA and tells employees how to file a complaint with the DOL if their employer violates the act. You must display the poster in a place where employees and applicants can easily see and read it, and it must remain up even if you don't currently have any employees who are eligible for FMLA leave. You can download and print a copy of the poster at http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/fmla.htm. If you have employees who are not literate in English, you must provide the poster in the language in which they are literate.  , Under the FMLA, your payroll records must meet the same standards set in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).Payroll records must include identifying information, rate of pay, terms of compensation, hours worked, other compensation, and total compensation paid to each employee. When an employee returns from FMLA leave, he or she must be restored either to the same job or one that is virtually identical in terms of pay, benefits, and other terms of employment. Complete records must be kept for at least three years.  , When employees exercise their rights under FMLA, keep the documents in one place.Your file should include the dates and hours of FMLA leave taken, as well as any other employee benefits or leave hours used. Each employee is only entitled to 12 weeks of leave per 12-month period. You are responsible for keeping accurate records for each employee so you know how much leave he or she has available when a request is made. Include any written requests from the employee, as well as copies of all notices sent to the employee regarding his or her leave. You are allowed to request medical certification of the employee's condition. If you request medical certification you must give the employee 15 days to provide it. If you require period status updates or certification of the employee's fitness to return to work, include copies of these reports with your other FMLA paperwork. Any documents related to a medical certification or medical history of an employee or an employee's family members should be maintained as confidential records separate from other FMLA records.  , If you deny an employee's FMLA request, make sure the reasons for that denial are documented and any additional paperwork is kept.Employees may either file a private lawsuit or a complaint with the DOL if they are unsatisfied with your response to FMLA requests. You will need this documentation to defend your actions, particularly if you denied an employee leave. Keep in mind that the FMLA requires all notices to employees to be in writing, and to be delivered within a particular period of time. In the event an employee disagrees with your actions regarding his or her leave request, you will need to prove that you provided the proper notices within the deadlines established by the FMLA. #Update personnel files with details regarding benefits. Each employee's file should include details about the employer-provided benefits he or she has accrued.If the employee is receiving benefits such as insurance, these must be maintained while the employee is on FMLA leave. You can require the employee to continue to pay his or her portion of any premiums, and it is the employee's responsibility to make arrangements to do so. Maintain records of all premium payments to comply with this FMLA requirement. If the employee fails to pay his or her premiums as agreed while on leave, you and the insurance carrier have the right to discontinue coverage. If the employee fails to return to work after taking FMLA leave, you may be able to recover premiums you paid during the leave period.  , Although not required by the FMLA, requiring written notice enables you to document all requests accurately and maintain complete records.If the employee's need for leave is reasonably foreseeable, you may require 30 days written notice of any FMLA request. Where the need is not foreseeable, such as in a medical emergency, the employee still must provide you notice as soon as possible. Employee notice must include sufficient information for you to understand that his or her leave is covered by FMLA.  , If an employee requests leave that could implicate the FMLA, you only have a few days after receipt of the request to respond.Since employees are not responsible for indicating whether they intend to use FMLA, anyone who regularly accepts employee leave requests must know how to quickly review an employee request and determine whether the FMLA applies. Depending on the size of your business, you may want to consider designating a single manager or supervisor to handle all FMLA requests.  , Employees who don't indicate they are requesting leave under FMLA must be notified if you elect to designate it as such.Employees must be notified in advance if the leave they've requested is being counted against their FMLA time. Even if you later learn that leave the employee took previously qualified under FMLA, you can't go back and retroactively designate it as FMLA leave. Only one such notice is required for each qualifying reason within a 12-month period of time.  , Within five business days of the employee's request, you must send him or her an eligibility notice that outlines the employee's expectations and obligations, and the consequences for failure to fulfill any of those obligations.This notice generally must state whether the employee is eligible for FMLA leave, and if not eligible include at least one reason. For example, if you hire an employee in January and she requests leave to care for her mother in August of the same year, you would send her an eligibility notice stating she was ineligible for FMLA because she had not worked for you for 12 months. The DOL has a pre-printed form you can fill out and use to satisfy this notice requirement. You can download the form at http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh-381.pdf. The rights and responsibilities notice must include the amount of leave the employee has available under the FMLA, how much of his or her requested leave will count against the FMLA entitlement, and any requirements regarding certification of the employee's medical condition, payment of health insurance premiums, or substitution of paid or accrued leave.

"['know what ""ergo"" means', 'understand that ""ergo"" is a conjunctive adverb', 'note that “ergo” is considered an archaic term.while you can use ""ergo"" and may hear or read it on occasion', 'the term is generally considered an archaic one', 'meaning that is ""dated"" and no longer a common term in modern english', 'use ""ergo"" with a semicolon.usually', 'you will see “ergo” preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma', 'begin a sentence with ""ergo', 'be careful with commas', 'follow all applicable standard grammar rules.the sentence or sentences themselves must make sense concerning all other grammatical aspects', 'apply the term to both serious and lighthearted matters']",How to Use Ergo," The term ""ergo"" can be defined to mean ""as a result"" or ""for that reason.""Similar words include ""therefore,"" ""hence,"" ""consequently,"" ""so,"" ""thus,"" and ""accordingly."" You can use ""ergo"" when describing the relationship between a cause and an effect.  Example: I love reading; ergo, I have a large library at home.; , It can also be described as an adverbial conjunction. The two parts of speech are interchangeable and essentially describe words that share properties of both adverbs and conjunctions.   An adverb is a term that modifies a verb or an adjective. A conjunction word that is used to connect two sentences, clauses, or ideas. A conjunctive adverb is a word that modifies the verb of an independent clause in a way that demonstrates a connection to another independent clause.  Example: I love reading; ergo, I have a large library at home.  In this sentence, ""ergo"" modifies the verb ""have"" in the independent clause, “I have a large library at home.” It also connects the clause beginning with ""I have"" to the independent clause, ""I love reading,"" and indicates that the latter is a result of the former.    ,   This does not mean that you cannot use the term ""ergo."" It does, however, mean that you should be cautious about using it. Using it too often can seem forced, pretentious, or unnatural. Since there are other terms that can be used in the same way, like ""therefore,"" you may want to ask yourself if ""ergo"" is the best choice before you use it. In spite of the fact that it is an archaic term, ""ergo"" is still used more often than many archaic terms, which does grant it some form of modern relevancy.  Example: Instead of saying, “I love reading; ergo, I have a large library at home,” consider saying, “I love reading; therefore, I have a large library at home.”  , This is one correct way to use the word and tends to look the most natural.   Typically, you use the term to indicate how the information of one clause results from the information in the clause before it. Since the two clauses are independent, you need to bridge them together with some form of punctuation. As two independent clauses, they need to be separated with a semicolon rather than a comma.  Example: She had five cats at home; ergo, anyone allergic to cats never enjoyed staying at her house.  ,""If done correctly, you can also begin a sentence with “ergo.” The term should still be followed by comma, as it is when used with a semicolon.   Essentially, “ergo” is used in the same way at the beginning of a sentence as it is when used after a semicolon. You're simply splitting the two independent clauses into two separate sentences.  Example: She had five cats at home. Ergo, anyone allergic to cats never enjoyed staying at her house.  , The most common mistake people make when using “ergo” is the dreaded comma splice. This occurs when you replace what should be a semicolon with a simple comma.   Standard coordinating conjunctions can join sentences and clauses, but conjunctive adjectives cannot do so. As a result, punctuating ""ergo"" the same way you would punctuate a standard conjunction—""and,"" ""or,"" ""but""—cannot be done.   Incorrect example: Jim got caught in traffic on his way to work, ergo, he missed this morning's meeting.  Correct example: Jim got caught in traffic on his way to work; ergo, he missed this morning's meeting.  Correct example: Jim got caught in traffic on his way to work and missed this morning's meeting.   You can surround ""ergo"" with commas if you are using the term to further clarify the meaning of a sentence. If you remove ""ergo"" from the sentence, it must be able to stand on its own.   Example: Carol enjoyed the outdoors. She decided, ergo, to spend her vacation camping.    , You must also make sure that you use “ergo” in a way that matches its definition.   Always use “ergo” to express results or effect. You cannot use it to contrast, emphasize, illustrate, or describe the sequence of time because its meaning simply does not agree with those purposes.   Incorrect example: The two friends used to be inseparable; ergo, one moved away in the fifth grade, and the two lost contact after that.  Correct example: The two friends used to be inseparable; however, one moved away in the fifth grade, and the two lost contact after that.   As with all sentences, your subjects and verbs must agree with each other, all pronouns must clearly describe a previously mentioned noun, and the overall sentence must be parallel. Any rule you have learned concerning sentence syntax and grammar must still be followed here.  , Due to the fact that “ergo” is an archaic term, you will often see it applied ironically or in a tongue-in-cheek tone. You can still use it seriously, of course, but it stands out most in modern applications when used in a lighthearted way.    Example A: My neighbor Sally and the Queen of England are never in the same place at the same time; ergo, Sally must secretly be the Queen of England.  In this example, ""ergo"" is used to mockingly imply some degree of academic or serious thought even though the claim made is clearly preposterous. Using a ""prim and proper"" archaic term is a way of highlighting the sarcasm of the statement.    Example B: Robert had a stressful day at work; ergo, he went straight to sleep as soon as he got home.  In this example, ""ergo"" is used seriously. The grammar is correct, but one might expect to see something more common in its place, like ""therefore,"" ""as a result,"" or ""as such.""

Although you may be tempted to rush into print, you should consider confirming the facts of the story with a second source before publishing.   Sometimes people leak false stories because they have a vendetta against the person.You should corroborate the main facts of the story with a second independent source. Take good notes of your fact-checking and document all facts.Keep a log in which you write the date you contacted someone, the number you called, and details about what the person said.; , If you intend to publish a potentially defamatory statement, then ask the person for a comment.You don’t have to publish the response, though it could help you.If you write an article or book, you can share a draft with any real person you have written about. Ask them if they would recommend changes.  , Someone can sue you for disclosing private facts that are embarrassing. However, you can defend yourself if those facts are already in the public realm. Do research to see if the information you intend to publish has already been published.   Look at people’s social media accounts. These are often a treasure trove of personal information about someone. Document what you find. Print out web pages or download photographs that show the information has been publicly disclosed.  , You can always publish something if you get the person’s consent. Try to have them sign an interview release form.The release form should include the following information in the body of the release:   A grant of permission to interview: “I hereby give permission to to interview me and record my voice.” Permission to publish the information gathered in the interview: “I further hereby give permission for to use, reuse, publish, and republish the same in whole or in part for any lawful purposes in any and all media, including print, the Internet, and broadcast media, and to use my full name in connection therewith.”A release from liability: “I hereby release all right, title, or interest in and to all or any part of my tape-recorded or transcribed interviews and declare that they may be used without any restriction whatsoever and may be copyrighted and published by the said party or entities designated by said party.”A signature line. Remember that minors (those under 18) also need a parent or guardian to sign. Get a witness to sign. A release is always stronger if you have a witness sign it as well.  , You can protect yourself by describing the person in such a way that other people can’t recognize who you are writing about. Make sure that you change more than one or two details. For example, if you are writing about a professor of Russian literature at a local university, you shouldn’t just change her hair color. Instead, you should think about changing:age profession time place physical description  , You are protected from a defamation claim if you offer an opinion instead of a statement of fact.Some statements are obviously opinions—“he is the dumbest person in the world” is obviously an opinion since no one would assume that you know everyone in the world.   However, to protect yourself, make sure to preface your statements with “In my opinion…” In this way, you can flag to the reader that you are offering an opinion. You might draw your opinion from certain facts in the public record. If so, then provide a link or citation to those facts., You should always be careful before accusing someone of a crime.Unless you have public records showing a person was convicted in court, you should avoid using language like “crook,” “corrupt,” “cheat,” etc.You can also harm the reputation of businesses, so you should be careful before writing that a business has engaged in illegal or unethical conduct., You are safer using government sources than information from private citizens. If possible, take information from court records, public documents, or government reports. You are less likely to be sued for invasion of privacy if you gather information from these sources., You should be careful relying on confidential anonymous sources. If you are sued, then you face a choice—reveal your source (and break your promise of confidentiality) or not reveal your source and have the court assume you are lying. Neither is a good situation. If possible, identify your sources. Also quote them accurately.   Also make sure that you identify their position or title when you identify them in your article., You can be sued for misleading or false headlines and captions.Although the body of the story might describe the facts more fully, headlines and captions themselves can be misleading.  , If you are writing a novel, then you might want to include a disclaimer. For example, you should include the following disclaimer in a work of fiction:   “This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, and incidents are the products of the author’s imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual events, locales, or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental.”Using a disclaimer does not provide 100% protection. However, it can help establish that a reasonable person would understand your work was fictitious. You can also provide a disclaimer if you are writing a memoir. For example, you should state that you are writing about your memories and that other people might have conflicting memories.  , The truth is that anyone can sue you for almost anything, no matter how frivolous. Being sued does not mean that you will lose the lawsuit. In fact, you have strong First Amendment rights to protect you. You can win many lawsuits even if sued.   For example, authors almost always win defamation suits involving fiction. Over the past 30 years, nearly every lawsuit brought for defamatory statements in fiction has been dismissed before ever going to trial.However, you might be very risk-averse. If you want to avoid any possibility of a lawsuit, then you shouldn’t write about real people. That is the only way to be 100% certain you won’t be sued.  , No matter how careful you are, you might still make errors in your reporting. If you are contacted about errors, you should issue corrections. If the error goes to the heart of a story, you might need to retract the story.   When someone calls, be polite. Avoid admitting an error.Instead, take down the person’s explanation for why the story is inaccurate and say you will look into it. By retracting a false statement, you can usually reduce the likelihood that you will be sued.Make sure a retraction is given sufficiently prominent position in your paper or on your blog. Don’t bury retractions so that they are hard to find., You should always meet with a lawyer if you have questions about whether or not to publish something about a real person. The lawyer can advise you about your risk of a lawsuit and also suggest ways of rewriting the material. You can get referrals by visiting your local or state bar association.   A bar association is a professional organization of lawyers. You can find your nearest bar association by visiting the American Bar Association website and clicking on your state.You also might want to talk to other writers. Ask if they have ever consulted with a lawyer and, if so, whether they would recommend their lawyer.  , Some organizations provide free legal services to journalists. You can find the nearest legal aid organization by visiting the Legal Services Corporation’s website and entering your address.   The Reporter’s Committee for the Freedom of the Press runs a Legal Hotline journalists can use. Call 1-800-336-4243 between 9:00 am and 6:00 pm Eastern Standard Time., Before publishing, you should have a basic understanding of defamation. Generally, you defame someone when you publish a false statement that injures the person’s reputation and you had no right to publish it.Accordingly, truth is an absolute defense to defamation. If you are sued, the person suing you will claim the statement is false, so you will need to rely on your fact-checking to establish that it is true. If you are writing about a public figure, such as a celebrity or a politician, then you can only be held liable for defamation if the statement is false and you either knew it was false or suspected it was false but were reckless in not checking its accuracy. This is called “actual malice.”Consequently, you can escape liability if the statement is false but you made an attempt to find out if it was accurate. You can produce your fact-checking log to show you tried to confirm the truth.  , Whereas defamation injures someone’s reputation, invasion of privacy causes unacceptable embarrassment by violating their right to be left alone. There are many different types of invasion of privacy claims a person could bring. They differ from defamation in one key way: you can be sued for invasion of privacy even if you didn’t make a false statement about someone.   You can be sued if you publicly disclose private facts about someone. The facts must have been private (not disclosed before) and they must be offensive to a reasonable person. Furthermore, the facts cannot be newsworthy.For example, showing video of a woman’s c-section birth without her permission probably constitutes invasion of privacy. You can be sued if you represent someone in a “false light.” For example, illustrating a story of child molesters with a stock photo can create a false impression that the person in the photo is a child molester.Unlike with defamation, you didn’t make an explicit, false statement that the person is a molester; however, you created that false impression in the reader’s mind. You can be sued if you appropriate someone’s likeness or name without permission. You can’t, for example, claim that someone endorses your product without their permission. You can’t say that a celebrity is a dedicated reader of your newspaper even if he is, in fact, a subscriber.

Aperture or stop. This is the adjustable hole through which light passes on its way from the subject, through the lens, to the film (or digital sensor). Like the pinhole in a pinhole camera, it blocks rays of light except those that would, even without a lens, tend to form an inverted image by passing through that central point to a corresponding point in the opposite direction on the film. With a lens, it also blocks rays of light that would pass through far from the center, where the lens glass may less closely approximate (usually with various easy-to-make spherical surfaces) the shapes that would focus it perfectly (usually much more complex aspherical surfaces), causing aberrations.  Because every camera has an aperture, usually adjustable, and if not, at least has the edges of the lens as an aperture, the aperture size setting is what is normally called the ""aperture"".    F-stop or simply aperture. This is the ratio of the focal length of the lens to the size of the aperture. This kind of measurement is used because a given focal ratio produces the same image brightness, requiring the same shutter speed for a given ISO setting (film speed or equivalent sensor light amplification) without regard to focal length.  Iris diaphragm or simply iris. This is the device most cameras use to form and adjust the aperture. It consists of a series of overlapping thin metal blades that can swing toward the center of a hole in a flat metal ring. It forms a central hole that is perfectly round wide open, when the blades are out of the way, and constricts by pushing the blades toward the center of that hole to form a smaller polygonal hole (which may have curved edges).  If your camera uses interchangeable lenses, or it is a ""bridge"" type digital camera, the lens will have an adjustable diaphragm iris. If your camera is a shirt-pocket sized ""point-and-shoot"" compact model, especially a lower priced model, it may have a ""neutral density filter"" instead of a diaphragm iris. Also, if the camera's mode dial includes ""M"", ""Tv"", and ""Av"", it almost certainly has an actual diaphragm iris; this applies even on small compact models. If the mode dial doesn't include these three settings, the camera might have a diaphragm, or it might only have an ND filter; the only way to know for sure is to read the specifications in the owner's manual, or read a detailed professional review (Google your camera's model name with the word ""reviews"", and you will probably find at least two or three reviews on the Internet). If your camera uses an ND filter, your ability to ""fine tune"" your settings and control depth of field and bokeh effects will be limited to whatever the fixed aperture of the lens provides. NOTE on Mode Dial settings: ""M"" stands for ""Manual"" - in this mode you have to set both the shutter speed and aperture. ""Tv"" is shutter speed priority: you manually set the shutter speed, and the camera's exposure computer sets an appropriate aperture. ""Av"" is ""Aperture Priority"" - you manually set the f-stop (aperture) that you want, typically to achieve a specific depth of field, and the camera's exposure computer decides what shutter speed to use. Most SLR cameras only close down the iris diaphragm, making it visible from the front of the lens, during an exposure or when the depth-of-field-preview function is activated.    Stopping down means to use a smaller, or (depending on context) a relatively small aperture (large f/ number).  Opening up means to use a larger, or (depending on context), a relatively large aperture (small f/ number).  Wide open means to use the largest aperture (smallest f/number).  Depth of field is the specific front-to-back area, or (depending on context) the scope of the front-to-back area that appears fairly sharp. A smaller aperture increases depth of field and decreases the extent to which objects outside the depth of field are blurred. The precise extent of depth of field is somewhat subjective because focus drops off gradually from the precise distance of focus, and the noticeability of defocus depends on factors such as subject type, other sources of lack of sharpness, and viewing conditions.  A relatively large depth-of-field is called deep; a relatively small depth-of-field is called shallow.    Aberrations are imperfections in a lens's ability to focus light sharply. Generally speaking, less-expensive and more-exotic types of lenses (such as superwides) have more severe aberrations.  Aperture has no effect on linear distortion (straight lines appearing curved), but it often goes away toward the middle of a zoom lens's focal-length range, and pictures can be composed to avoid drawing attention to it such as by not putting prominent obviously straight lines such as on buildings or horizons close to the frame edges, and it can be corrected in software or by some digital cameras automatically.    Diffraction is a basic aspect of the behavior of waves passing through small openings which limits the maximum sharpness of all lenses at smaller apertures.It becomes increasingly apparent past f/11 or so, making a great camera and lens no better than a so-so one (albeit sometimes one exactly suited for a specific need such as great depth of field or a long shutter speed where lower sensitivity or a neutral-density filter is not available).; , Depth of field is, formally, the range of object distances within which objects are imaged with acceptable sharpness. There is only one distance at which objects will be in perfect focus, but sharpness drops off gradually in front of and behind that distance. For a short distance in each direction, objects will be blurred so little that the film or sensor will be too coarse to detect any blurring; for a somewhat greater distance they will still appear ""pretty"" sharp in the final picture.The pairs of depth-of-field marks for certain apertures next to the focusing scale on a lens are good for estimating this latter measure..   Roughly one-third of the depth of field is in front of the focus distance, and two-thirds is behind (if not extending to infinity, since it is a phenomenon relating to the amount by which light rays from an object have to be bent to converge at a focal point and rays coming from far distances tend toward parallel.) Depth of field drops off gradually. Backgrounds and foregrounds will appear slightly soft, if not in focus, with a small aperture, but very blurred or unrecognizable with a wide aperture. Consider whether they are important and should be in focus, relevant for context and should be a little soft, or distracting and should be blurred.  If you want great background blur but do not have quite enough depth of field for your subject, focus on the part that will draw the most attention, often the eyes.   Depth of field generally appears to depend on, in addition to aperture, focal length (longer focal length gives less), format size (smaller film or sensor size gives more, assuming the same angle of view, i.e., equivalent focal length), and distance (there is much less at close focus distances). So, if you want shallow depth of field, you can buy a super-fast lens (expensive), or zoom in (free) and set even a cheap smaller-aperture lens wide open. The artistic purpose of depth of field is to deliberately have the entire picture sharp or to ""crop depth"" by diffusing distracting foreground and/or background. A more practical purpose of depth of field is to set a small aperture and pre-focus the lens to the ""hyperfocal distance"" (the closest at which the depth of field extends to infinity from a given distance; see a table or the depth of field marks on the lens for the aperture chosen) or to an estimated distance, to be ready to take a picture quickly with a manual-focus camera or a subject moving too fast or unpredictably for autofocus (in which case you'll need a high shutter speed too).  Remember that you normally won't see any of this through your viewfinder (or on your screen as you're composing. Modern cameras meter with the lens at its widest aperture, and only stop down the lens to its selected aperture at the moment of exposure. The depth-of-field preview function usually allows only a dim and imprecise view. (Disregard any odd patterns in the focusing screen view; they will not appear in the final picture.) What's more, viewfinders on modern digital SLRs and other autofocus cameras don't even show the true wide-open depth of field with a lens faster than f/2.8 or so (it's shallower than it looks; rely on autofocus, not subject to this limitation, when possible). A better option on digital cameras is to simply take the picture, then play it back and zoom in on your LCD to see if the background is adequately sharp (or blurred) enough.  , A flash burst is normally so short that the flash component of an exposure is affected only by aperture. (Most 35mm and digital SLRs have a maximum ""flash-sync"" flash-compatible shutter speed; above that only a fraction of the frame would be exposed due to the way in which their ""focal-plane"" shutter works. Special high-speed-sync flash modes use a rapid burst of weak flashes, each exposing a fraction of the frame; they greatly reduce flash range and so are rarely helpful.) A wide aperture increases maximum flash range. It also increases effective fill-flash range by increasing the proportionate exposure from a flash and reducing the time during which ambient light is allowed in. A small aperture may be needed to prevent overexposure in close-ups due to a minimum output below which a flash cannot be reduced (indirect flash, which is inherently less efficient, can help in this situation). Many cameras can adjust the balance of flash and ambient lighting with ""flash exposure compensation"". A digital camera is best for complex flash setups because the results of instantaneous bursts of light are inherently non-intuitive, even though some studio flashes have ""modeling lights"" and some fancy portable flashes have modeling-light-like preview modes.  , All lenses are different and are better shot at different apertures for optimal performance. Get out and shoot something with lots of fine texture at different apertures and compare the shots to figure out how your lens behaves at various apertures. The object should be all essentially at ""infinity"" (30 feet or more with wide-angles to hundreds of feet with tele-lenses; a distant stand of trees is generally good) to avoid confusing defocus with aberrations. Here's some hints as to what to look for:    Nearly all lenses have lower contrast and are less sharp at their widest aperture, especially towards the corners of your image. This is especially true on point-and-shoot and cheaper lenses. Consequently, if you're going to have detail in the corners of your pictures that you want to keep sharp, then you'll want to use a smaller aperture. For flat subjects, f/8 is typically the sharpest aperture. For objects at varying distances a smaller aperture may be better for more depth of field.  Most lenses will have some noticeable amount of light fall-off wide open. Light fall-off is where the edges of the picture are slightly darker than the centre of the picture. This can be a good thing for many photographs, especially portraits; it draws attention towards the centre of the photograph, which is why many people add falloff in post. But it's still good to know what you're getting. Falloff is usually invisible after about f/8. Zoom lenses can vary depending on how far in or out they are zoomed. Test for the above things at a few different zoom settings. Diffraction makes almost every lens's images softer at f/16 and smaller apertures, and conspicuously softer at f/22 and smaller. All of this is just something to think about for optimum clarity of a picture that already has as good a composition--including depth of field – as possible, and which will not be much more grossly marred by insufficient shutter speed causing camera-shake or subject blur or noise from excessive ""sensitivity"" (amplification). Don't waste film investigating this – check your lenses on a digital camera, check reviews, and in a pinch assume expensive or prime (non-zoom) lenses are best at f/8, cheap simple ones such as kit lenses are best at f/11, and cheap exotic ones such as superwides or lenses with wide or tele adapters are best at f/16. (With an adapter lens on a point and shoot, stop down as much as possible, perhaps by using the camera's aperture-priority mode – look in its menus.)  ,    Bokeh, a Japanese word often used to refer to the appearance of out-of-focus areas, especially highlights because those appear as bright blobs. Much has been written about the details of those out-of-focus blobs, which are sometimes brighter in the middle and sometimes a little brighter at the edges, like donuts, or some combination of the two, but at least one author rarely notices it except in bokeh articles. Most importantly, out-of-focus blurs are:  Much larger and more diffuse at wider apertures. Soft-edged at the widest aperture, due to the perfectly round hole (the edge of a lens, rather than an iris blade). The shape of the diaphragm opening, when not at the widest aperture. This is most noticeable at wide apertures because they are large. This might be considered unattractive with a lens whose opening does not closely approximate a circle, such as a cheap lens with a five- or six-bladed diaphragm. Sometimes half-moons rather than circular toward the sides of images at very wide apertures, probably due to one of the lens elements not being as huge as it would have to be to fully illuminate all parts of the image at that aperture, or weirdly extended due to ""coma"" at very wide apertures (which is pretty much only an issue when taking pictures of lights at night). Prominently donut-like with mirror-type tele lenses, due to a central obstruction.    Diffraction spikes forming sunstars. Very bright highlights, such as light bulbs at night or small specular reflections of sunlight, will be surrounded by ""diffraction spikes"" making ""sunstars"" at small apertures (they are formed by increased diffraction at the points of the polygonal hole formed by the iris). These will either have the same number of points as your lens has aperture blades (if you have an even number of them), due to overlapping of opposite-sides' spikes, or twice as many (if you have an odd number of aperture blades). They are fainter and less noticeable with lenses with many, many aperture blades (generally odd lenses such as old Leicas).  , Most importantly (in terms of aperture at least), Control your depth of field. It's as simple as this: a smaller aperture means more depth of field, a larger aperture means less. A larger aperture also means more background blur. Here's some examples:   Use a small aperture to force more depth of field.  Remember that depth of field becomes shallower the closer you get.If you're doing macro photography, for example, you might want to stop down far more than you would for a landscape. Insect photographers often go way down to f/16 or smaller, and have to nuke their subjects with lots of artificial lighting.  Use a large aperture to force a shallow depth of field. This is great for portraits (much better than the silly automatic portrait scene modes), for example; use the largest aperture you have, lock your focus on the eyes, recompose and you'll find the background is thrown out of focus and is, consequently, made less distracting. Remember that opening the aperture like this will cause faster shutter speeds to be chosen. In bright daylight, make sure you aren't causing your camera to max out its fastest shutter speed (typically 1/4000 on digital SLRs). Keep your ISO low to avoid this.  , If you're photographing lights at night, have adequate camera support, and want sunstars, use a small aperture. If you want large, perfectly rounded bokeh spots (albeit with some incomplete circles), use a wide-open aperture.  , Use a relatively large aperture and fast shutter speed if necessary to mix flash with daylight so the flash isn't overwhelmed., If depth of field is not of primary importance (which would generally be the case when pretty much everything in the picture is relatively far from the lens and will be in focus anyway), the shutter speed will be high enough to avoid blur from camera shake and the ISO setting will be low enough to avoid severe noise or other quality loss (which would generally be the case in daytime), you don't need any aperture-related gimmicks, and any flash is powerful enough to balance with ambient light adequately, set the aperture that gives the best detail with the particular lens being used.  ,","['aperture-related special effects', 'flash', 'special effects', 'terminology', 'interaction', 'instantaneous lighting', 'aperture-priority mode', 'lenses', 'aperture', 'optimal sharpness', 'optimum technical image quality', 'depth', 'basic concepts', 'lens aperture', 'field']"
"['check applicable laws and regulations to make sure you qualify', 'gather information about your claim', 'fill out the appropriate form', 'submit the form to the appropriate agency', 'follow any other local procedures', 'file a lawsuit']",How to Claim for Damages1," Your city or county has specific laws that determine what claims you can file against the city or county government.   All city and county governments have deadlines for filing claims. For example, if you have a personal injury claim against Los Angeles County, it must be filed within six months of the occurrence that gave rise to the claim. A property damage claim must be filed within one year.The applicable deadline typically can be found by reading your state's statute of limitations law.Deadlines for filing a claim for damages or a lawsuit against the local government typically are far shorter than they would be if you were suing a private business or individual.; , Before you start filling out the form, make sure you have any necessary documentation or other evidence that supports your claim.For example, if your car was damaged when you drove over a pothole in a city street, your evidence might include photos of the damage to your car or an estimate from a mechanic for the cost of repairs. Estimates, receipts, or police reports all must be included to help establish your damages as part of your claim., Your city or county typically will have a form available for you to file a claim for damages.You can get a claim form by visiting the city or county government website, or by calling or visiting your city or county clerk's office.Follow all instructions provided regarding the formatting and filling out of the form. For example, you typically will be instructed that hand-written answers should be printed legibly using blue or blank ink.If you're filing a personal injury claim, you may be required to fill out and file a medical release form in addition to your claim form., Once you've completed your form, you must submit it to the government agency or department responsible for your damages.   Before you send your form, double-check your information to make sure everything is complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge. You must sign your form under penalty of perjury and may be charged with a crime for submitting a false claim.The city government's website or the city's customer service line should be able to tell you where to submit your claim. For example, if you have a claim for damages against the city of Seattle, you must file your form at the city clerk's office in city hall.Forms for damages that occurred on city streets or on public transportation typically must be filed with the city or metropolitan transit authority., If your city or county has any additional requirements such as hearings or interviews related to your claim, make sure you follow up as necessary.   Once you file your claim, the city or a claim adjuster working for the city will review and investigate your claim.You may be contacted for further information during the process of investigation. Expect the city to take anywhere from 60 days to several months to send you a report on the investigation and a decision on your claim.In most cases, the city or county will resolve your claim over the telephone or through the mail, and you won't have any reason to meet with the claims adjuster or any other government staff in person., If the local government doesn't resolve your claim to your liking, you may have the ability to file a lawsuit in state court.For example, if you file a claim against Los Angeles County and your claim is rejected, you have six months from the date on your rejection notice to file a case in court.If you want to file a lawsuit against the city, you should consider consulting a private attorney to review your claim and go over your options with you. To file a lawsuit, you typically must pay fees ranging between $300 and $600 just to initiate your lawsuit. After you file your complaint, you will incur other costs as the lawsuit proceeds to trial, regardless of whether you hire an attorney.If you cannot afford the fees, you may be able to file a request with the court to have the fees waived.

To check your rabbit, gently roll the rabbit onto its back so that you can see the underside of the rabbit's back legs.Take care not to force the rabbit over, as this can damage their spine. You may find it helps to cover the rabbit's eyes with a towel as this has a naturally subduing effect. It's a good idea to sit on the floor when checking your rabbit, just in case they wriggle and you let go.; , There is a sliding scale of severity from fur loss right through to full thickness pressure sores with secondary infections.In its mildest form, the rabbit may lose the fur on the surface in contact with the ground, and the skin may look slightly red.If the problem has progressed a bit further, the area may become puffy or swollen, the skin may be obviously reddened or even cracked or scabby. Even further, it can develop into a sore or ulcer form. An ulcer is when the surface of the skin breaks open, often in response to pressure, such as is the case with bed sores., Unfortunately, once the surface of the skin is broken, this provides an entry route for bacteria and infections. To check for this, look for a weeping discharge, often consisting of pus, from the sore.The area may smell unpleasant. Usually there is significant swelling and large areas of skin loss from the lower surface of the limb. Once the discharge is cleaned away you may even be able to see underlying structures through the gap in the skin, such as tendons or ligaments.  , This rabbit will be very uncomfortable and reluctant to move around. Unfortunately this worsens the problem because the rabbit spends longer in one spot, which may be damp and contributing to the sore hocks. Thus a classic vicious circle develops.In some cases the infection spreads into the joints or even the bones. This is very painful and the rabbit will be reluctant to move. When it does move, it will be with an abnormal gait or a limp. The pain and discomfort may also stop the rabbit from eating.  , Keep the rabbit's claws short, so that the foot lies at a normal angle. Also give the rabbit a deep bed of soft straw, so that the injured area is cushioned a bit.   Be sure to keep the rabbit's cage or hutch clean as well. If the hock injury was caused by the rabbit sitting in urine, clean the area and make sure it is no longer sitting in its filth.  , If you discover your rabbit has sore hocks then seek veterinary attention. The vet will look at the hock area and assess whether the skin is damaged. If it is, the vet will also assess whether a secondary infection is present. If the answer is yes, the vet will investigate whether the infection has spread to the bones or joints, which may involve radiography of the affected bones.   The vet will examine the rabbit to check for health problems that could cause it to sit still for longer than normal. The veterinarian will also check the length of the rabbit's claws. Long claws raise up the paw, especially on hard surfaces, pushing the weight back onto the rabbit's hocks.  , The sores will need to be cleaned and wrapped, in order to prevent further irritation. Your veterinarian should show you the proper procedure for cleaning and wrapping the wound, as you will need to change the wrapping on a regular basis.Your veterinarian my prescribe a medication, such as an antibiotic, to apply to the wound. This will help kill any infection and allow the wound to begin healing., To understand how hock sores occur, it first helps to understand how rabbits move in the wild. They are constantly moving around from one patch of grass to another. Soil is relatively soft and allows the rabbit's claws to sink into the ground and the whole of the underside of the foot is in contact with the earth.This spreads the rabbit's weight evenly over a surface that is soft and forgiving.   Also, wild rabbits tend to be lean, so they are not carrying excess weight which presses down on the hock area.  , Contrast how a wild rabbit's hocks connect with the ground with pet rabbits. They move around over hard surfaces, such as carpet, laminate flooring, or lino. These surfaces do not allow the claws to dig in so the foot is naturally tilted up at the foot and down at the hock, adding pressure to the hocks.In addition rabbits kept in hutches for part of the time may be on abrasive surfaces such as mesh, which abrade and traumatize the skin to the lower limb.Also, wet bedding softens the skin and weakens its ability to form calluses and protect itself. Indeed, urine in straw macerates (softens) the skin further and dirty conditions predispose to infection.Pet rabbits may also be overweight, which adds extra pressure onto the rear limbs., Remove soiled areas of bedding from your rabbit's hutch on a regular basis. There should be no wet areas that the rabbit can sit in and damage its skin. Also make sure that your rabbit has a good surface to stand, and sit, on. It should not have to sit or stand on a wire flooring for long periods of time.Trim your rabbit's nails on a regular basis, so that its long nails don't press the hocks awkwardly onto the ground. Also, keep your rabbit at a healthy weight, so it is not carrying excess weight. Excess weight can put extra pressure on the hocks.

Fresh ginger is available at most supermarkets in the produce section. Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and is commonly used in cough remedies as an effective antihistamine and chest decongestant.Cut the ginger into very thin slices using a paring knife. Use a zester to get at least 1 teaspoon of lemon zest.  , Bring this to a boil over high heat.You will know when the pot is at a full boil when you have a constant stream of large bubbles coming to the surface and a good deal of steam. Once the pot has come to a full boil, reduce the heat to low.  , Then remove the ginger and cinnamon stick. The easiest way to remove the spices is with a strainer. Place a strainer into a clean saucepan. Pour the hot mixture through the strainer. The ginger and cinnamon will be left in the strainer and the liquid will be caught in the clean saucepan underneath.  , Bring this mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Honey has been studied in clinical trials. It has been proven to be as effective as cough syrup in suppressing coughs. You will want the sugar to dissolve. You can tell if the sugar is dissolved if you take a spoon of the liquid and cannot see any grains of sugar in it. Once the sugar is dissolved, you will use a candy thermometer to get this syrup to the hard-crack candy stage.  , You will use this to monitor the heat.The candy liquid will need to be heated to a high temperature in order to harden into lozenges. It is very important that you closely watch the temperature of the syrup so it doesn't burn onto the saucepan or become too hot to form hard cough drops. The goal temperature for hard-crack lozenges is 300-305 degrees Fahrenheit.  , It will rise quickly as you cook the liquid.As the liquid rises in temperature, it may darken. This is expected as the sugar in the syrup caramelizes. When the candy thermometer reaches 300-305 degrees, remove the liquid from heat. You will now add the final ingredients before pouring the mixture to cool in candy molds.  , As you add the juice, it may cause the hot liquid to splash. Stir completely to make sure the liquid is evenly mixed.  , You can use unflavored cooking spray to do so. Carefully pour the hot liquid into the molds. Take care to fill only the small candy mold and not to spill too much of the liquid over the top each. This recipe will make about 50 small lozenge sized pieces.  , This will take an hour or more.When the cough drops are cool, crack them out of the molds onto wax paper. To crack the drops out of the candy molds, tap the mold gently on a hard surface. The cough drops should fall out. You may have to bend the candy mold tray in order to get the cough drops out, similar to cracking ice.  , If you don't have superfine sugar at home, you can put regular granulated sugar in a food processor or blender. Process this until it is a finer consistency.Shake the jar to coat the cough drops with sugar. This will prevent them from sticking together. You can also use powdered sugar to coat the drops, but it tends to clump.  , You don't need to refrigerate them.Use them as needed. Since these don't contain any of the common drugs found in cough syrups, these are ideal if you want to avoid the side effects of over-the-counter cough remedies. The cough drops will have a pleasant, sweet taste of lemon, ginger, and cinnamon.  , There are several suggestions for herbal medicines that are effective at treating coughs and colds. Elderberry and elderflower has been used to relieve congestion. Slippery elm has been traditionally used by Native Americans to treat coughs and gastrointestinal conditions.Chamomile may be an effective treatment for coughs as it can help to reduce inflammation and mucus production.To make a strong tea, place a generous pinch of each herb into a cup of water in a saucepan. Heat the water and herbs to a simmer on high heat, then cover and reduce the heat. Let the tea steep for 15 to 20 minutes over the lowest heat. Strain out the herbs and reserve 1/2 cup of the tea for the cough drops.  , You can make DIY molds rather than using candy molds to make cough drops using sugar and a baking sheet.In a 9 x 13 pan or any cookie sheet, add a few cups of powdered sugar. Use your finger or a measuring spoon to make indentations in the sugar. This is where you will pour the syrup for your cough lozenges.  , Start by putting the 1/2 cup of herbal tea from Step 1 into a saucepan, then add 1.5 cups of honey and 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract.Use a medium to medium-high heat to heat up the ingredients. Stir constantly to make sure all the ingredients are mixed. Clip a candy thermometer on the side of the pan to monitor the temperature.  , You will want it to get to about 300 °F (149 °C). This will allow the liquid to harden into lozenges as it cools.The mixture may get slightly foamy as it heats up. If this occurs, give the cough drop liquid a stir. You will be able to tell once the mixture gets near to the correct temperature as it will thicken. This process generally takes about 30 minutes. Once the liquid is at a temperature of 300 degrees, remove it from the heat.  , Pour slowly and carefully.Pour the hot liquid into each of the small depressions in the powdered sugar on the baking sheet you prepared earlier. Alternatively, you can use a greased candy mold. If you don't have a candy mold or don't want to use sugar, you can pour the liquid onto a piece of greased parchment paper. Be aware that this is the messiest way to do this.  , Try not to disturb the cough drops as they cool.Once the drops have cooled, carefully move them out of their sugar molds. If using candy molds, crack the cough drops out of the molds. Coat the cough drops in powdered sugar. You can store these in single layers between wax paper in the refrigerator for about 3 weeks. You can also freeze them between layers of wax paper. If you choose to do so, they will last for several months.  , This recipe calls for slippery elm powder, cinnamon, honey, orange essential oil and lemon essential oil.You can buy slippery elm bark and the essential oils from most health food stores, herbal shops, or online herbal retailers such as Mountain Rose Herbs. Slippery elm contains a substance called mucilage. This becomes gel-like when combined with water or honey. This can help coat the mouth, throat, and digestive tract.Native Americans used this herbal remedy for centuries to calm coughs and gastrointestinal problems.Slippery elm has not been shown to cause any medical complications, unlike other herbal supplements. Little formal research has been conducted to show how effective it is at treating medical conditions. Remember that clinical studies have shown that honey is a very effective treatment for coughs. Cinnamon may also have some effectiveness at controlling a bad cough., Stir very thoroughly to combine.If the honey is too stiff has crystallized, try warming up the jar under warm water. This should thin the honey or reconstitute it. Sometimes this mixture is very dry and crumbly. If this is the case, you can add two more tablespoons of honey to make it easier to work with. When finished the mixture should resemble a soft dough. It may be sticky because of the honey.  , Use a dropper to make sure you get the right amount of drops for each.You will need 10 drops of orange essential oil and 6 drops of lemon essential oil. Mix these into the cough lozenge mixture thoroughly. You want to make sure they are incorporated evenly into the dough.  , These should be roughly the size of a teaspoon.Place these on a sheet of wax paper or parchment. You can lay this on a counter or a baking sheet. Place the lozenges in an area where they won't be disturbed. These cough lozenges may not be very attractive but they contain effective ingredients.  , You may need to leave them longer if you live in a humid climate.To store the lozenges, wrap them in wax paper.

However, if you don't plan to visit both parks, there are also options for just single-day visits. You can buy Disneyland tickets from their official site at https://disneyland.disney.go.com/tickets/. , Hotel accommodations for onsite hotels (such as the historic Disneyland Hotel, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa and the Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel) can be made on Disney's Disneyland website when you sign in. Any offsite accommodation bookings will need to be made separately, and there are many travel websites out there offering deals on air travel, car rental, and hotel stays., There are videos from the point of view of the rider available online for almost all Disney rides. Check YouTube and other similar resources. You won't find quite the same video resources for hotels and all Downtown Disney attractions, but you can find descriptions and photographs., Although this will vary by park (and whether or not there's a Early Admission option), the parks are generally open from 9AM to 10PM Pacific Time. However, some park events will force it to close much earlier or later than that on select nights.  Make sure you plan enough time to see it all. Your exact trip will vary depending on your goals and the ages/needs of those traveling with you. However, planning enough time for everything is crucial, if you want to see it all. If possible, schedule at least one night at each park so that you can experience both of Disneyland's nighttime shows: ""Wonderful World of Color"" at the Disney California Adventure park and ""Remember...Dreams Come True Fireworks Spectacular"" at Disneyland. If the nighttime fireworks aren't being shown, there are still some good light parades twice per night; these run between Fantasyland and a location near the Firehouse on Main Street, USA near the park entrance. Park maps can be found in their entirety at https://disneyland.disney.go.com/maps/.  , Besides your tickets, you'll need some money. Depending on the weather, you may want sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen, or perhaps a light rain poncho. Be sure that your belongings can be tucked away on rides., Anaheim is generally warm, but can have most misty-foggy summer mornings. Rain is rare but can be intense when it comes., If you are staying at an offsite hotel in Anaheim, there is the Anaheim Resort Transportation that is offered from many of hotel chains that is offered for more than half off the cost of parking near Disneyland. However, if you are coming from elsewhere or just plan on parking with your own car, Disneyland has their own parking structure just to the west of the Disneyland Resort and to the West of Downtown Disney. The address to the parking structure is 1313 S Disneyland Dr, Anaheim, CA 92802.The cost to park your car at this park is about $17, and even more for different types of vehicles., The tram will take you from the west side (parking lot entrance/exit) to the east entrance just before the bag check area nearest the walkway that connects the two parks.  However, if you'd like to walk to the park, you can take a walking path through Downtown Disney that will lead to this same entrance, or to the monorail which you can take you and your fellow guests from Downtown Disney into the park (with at least a valid park ticket (for first time entry) and ticket with hand stamp (for re-entry if you choose to leave and come-back)).  , Some rides offer FastPasses (which at Disneyland still come in the form of a paper ticket), but others don't, so plan and prioritize accordingly. Some attractions will be more swamped than others, so if you really want to ride a crowded one that doesn't offer a FastPass, head there right away to beat the crowd and make sure you get in, or aim for a less busy time.  Some rides in Disneyland come with warnings against riding them if you are pregnant or have health problems, but most are fairly safe and kid-friendly. At Disney California Adventure, however, attractions tend to be faster paced and induce more motion sickness. Not all rides there are appropriate for young children.  , At intervals throughout the day, you may want to take a break from lining up and riding the fast rides. Some of this downtime can be spent at some of the entertainment options around the parks.You can also enjoy the dining options, as well as shopping locations.If you are staying on site at a Disneyland hotel, they can deliver your purchases to you at the hotel, later on.  , Such attractions here include Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Enchanted Tiki Room (with it's incomparable Dole Whip stand) and Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Pirates of the Caribbean (with it's triple flumes that the Florida attraction can't match) and other special effects) and the Haunted Mansion attractions among the many other rides here that almost line up to those found in Disney's Magic Kingdom in Florida., This park tends to be forgotten until you have seen some of the attractions they offer here. If you've ever visited the parks in Florida and see that there's a wealth of rides that aren't offered in Disneyland, chances are a similar or comparable ride will be offered at Disney's California Adventure park here. In Disney's California Adventure park, you'll find rides such as California Screamin as well as MIckey's Fun Wheel (ferris wheel with some twists that make it unique), Radiator Springs Racers, Toy Story Midway Mania, Turtle Talk with Crush, Soarin Aroun the World and Muppet Vision 3D among the many excellent attractions here and even some unique rides near Paradise Pier that not even any other park would even plan to offer but show's the values of this beautiful state of California., This area is outside the Disneyland parks and doesn't require a ticket for entry. It offers a wealth of shops, as well as an AMC movie theatre and restaurants, including the popular wildlife-themed Rainforest Café. There are also lots of souvenir shops.","['disney', 'car reservations', 'tickets', 'tram', 'parks', 'flight', 'american', 'disneyland', 'shopping', 'downtime', 'california adventure', 'belongings', 'must-dos', 'attractions', 'attractions online', 'weather', 'park onsite', 'downtown disney', 'park', 'park hours', 'advance', 'online website', 'rides', 'hotel accommodations', 'parking structure']"

You need to learn how to control the pitch and tone of your voice.Sing from the stomach instead of the throat. Singing from the throat is like a speaker without a box. You don´t get the fullness of the sound. It will sound squeaky when you try to hit some good notes, especially the high ones. So, mainly use the throat as a conduit. Work on hitting high notes.Diaphragm pressure is the key to creating the heavier vocals used by rock singers.Your diaphragm controls the air that goes through your vocal chords. Some pressure in your diaphragm can push just enough air through your vocal chords to get that heavy grit out. Practice changing the pitch. Experiment with opening and closing your throat, lips, and teeth to see how much control you have over the sound. Closing your throat can add harshness or grit, while opening it can increase volume and improve timbre. Lips and teeth affect not only the character (what phonics you make) but also how the vibration of your vocal chords is translated into the air around you.; , As you become more controlled and proficient in using your voice, try to expand your musical vocabulary by learning about the basics of music and singing.   Vocal warm-ups, scales, intervals, and timbre are all helpful things to familiarize yourself with but remember the first rule of rock: do it your way. Choose your style of rock. Abandon musical lyricism, tone, and articulation. Rock singing should be rather ambiguous in rhythm, lyrics, and pitch. That is the essence of hard rock.  , Don't try to learn from a cd or machine. Get a great teacher. Many professional rock singers have done so. A voice coach will help you develop your voice and can give you tips in how to protect your voice.Rock has a vast array of voice styles and methods. An experienced coach can appropriately assess your improvement. A coach will help you improve your vocal range. There are no shortcuts. It takes a long time to learn to sing well. You might have natural talent, but that will take you only so far. You have to have a solid technique to have a stable career. That is why there are so many ""flash in the pan"" performers. They have no technique, and their voices crash and burn quickly.  , You do have to be able to hold enough breath to push a note loud enough for a microphone or audience to hear it.Focusing on core exercises such as abdominal, chest, and back muscles will help you tighten your core in order to focus on your breath. Cardio exercise such as biking, jogging, jump rope, and even brisk walking can improve the amount of breath you have for holding notes and can also help a lot if you're an active singer who does a lot of jumping around or headbanging while singing. Take care of your voice. While some singers can smoke and drink and sound like rock stars, that approach might not work for you. It's important to know the limitations of your own voice because nothing is worse than running your voice ragged before your band finishes its first set.  , Everybody has a different vocal range, but most male singers fall into the categories of either bass, baritone or tenor, while most females have either a contralto, mezzo soprano or soprano vocal range.   Some people have ranges that extend further than these categories. Learning your vocal range is very important because you need to know your limits. Learn how to scream. Develop a screaming-yelling style to your singing voice. Most rock singers do not utilize the same technique as pop stars do: instead of smooth transitions and mild sounds, they go for the more scream-like voice, making it sound more passionate. Try yelling parts of any rock lyrics without utilizing vocal notes and then replicating that feeling while singing.  , Singers have a bad reputation for being bad musicians. Don’t fall into that trap. Be a good to great musician. Anything less, and you're wasting your time and everyone else's.   Master the electric guitar. That’s a staple in rock bands. Or study piano. Also know how to read music; even better, know how to write music as well. Be realistic about your talent. If your voice isn’t what you want it to be, learn an instrument instead. Parents are rarely realistic about their children's talent. Have persistence and patience. Don't be in a hurry. It takes time. Perform in small venues until you are used to performing. Being a solid performer takes practice. Get a thick skin. Be prepared for what you might feel is vicious criticism. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t make it big right away. Expect to face a lot of rejection.  , If you want to become a rock celebrity with your band like blink-182, Angels & Airwaves, or NOFX, then you need to have songwriting chops.Each of those artists has written unique songs and did not get famous off of singing covers. Perform your own songs. Learn the music fundamentally. Your complete understanding of the notes and rhythms must be solid before you can work on stylizing your performance and songs.  , You’re not going to be a rock singer if you don’t get out there and play. Rock bands have many parts to them: Lead singer, drummer, bassist, guitarist.   There is no substitute for practicing a lot and then performing. Start out small: perform for family and friends. It would also help if you performed to a group consisting of an individual or individuals who know how to sing rock. After you perform, ask for suggestions and feedback. How can I become better? What do I need to tweak?  , If you're serious about becoming a rock star, you will have to create a demo recording so that producers can hear what you sound like when your voice is mixed on a professional quality CD. These are essential for those hoping to make commercial music.Use only your best songs on it - four to six at the most. The format used depends on who's getting it, and the type of equipment they have. Keep it simple. Start with your absolute best song.Make sure to label your demo. That way if it gets passed around, no one will forget that the great rock music on it belongs to you. Choose strong lyrics, and make sure the audio has strong clarity. You might want to think about getting an agent as well. However, be realistic; of the many thousands vying for stardom, only a few make it, so have a back-up plan and perhaps a day job.  , Rock is more than screaming. It’s about feeling. It’s about putting your opinions, emotions and beliefs into music. Sing what you believe and feel.   If you want to become a rock singer, sing with a passion. Let the words and the tune flow out of your heart. Let the pain, happiness, anger, sadness, anxiety, stress and hopefulness out. Let all your living emotions reach the maximum and explode from you. Let the music flow through your bloodstream. Listen to what you are making and enjoy it. Use your life in your music. Sing what you know so the emotions feel real.  , Rock aesthetics is built around the concept of individuality and rejection of conformity. Therefore, if you are setting out to emulate a singer or style you already like, you may set yourself back considerably in your learning process.   The beginnings and history of rock and roll (which over time ""split"" into what we now call rock and R&B) are replete with artists who made the most of a limited set of tools. Minimalism and sparse resources have always been a cornerstone of the genre. So first and foremost, trust yourself. You have the rock inside you, and no one needs to tell you how to let it out. Find what you do well, and stick with it. You may not have to ""try"" to make your voice unique. Try to sing in the way that is most comfortable for you. This is going to allow you to sing the strongest and longest your voice will allow. If you can only scream, then be the screamer in the band! If you can only hit falsetto notes, then play that into your style. If you feel like you can only sing really low notes, then stick to where your voice is comfortable. A lot of beginning rock singers waste their time trying to emulate their heroes.  , Try studying the vocal techniques of the singer in the song you are listening to. Is he/she singing putting more emphasis on the higher notes? The lower notes? Are the noises coming from the back of the singer's throat or from the front of the mouth?   Try mimicking specific notes and the way these are sung, as this will help you develop that rock technique. A lot of people say they want to learn how to sing rock but in the end of the day they never actually listen to rock music. Listening to rock music constantly can familiarize you with the beats.  , If you want to be a rock singer, you shouldn’t dress like a country singer. You need to master the look, while still keeping true to your own individuality.   Male rock singers often wear ripped jeans, ripped T-shirts, scuffed hair, black makeup around the eyes, spiked collars and spray painted black leather jackets. A typical female rock singer’s wardrobe might involve dark colors like black and purple, mini-skirts, T-shirts, leather jackets, boots, spiked bracelets, and long teased hair. Avoid pastels.  , The key is confidence. You need to be confident to project both voice and personality when on stage. This may be easier thought about than done––you may wish to join drama class or a club to help you to develop presence before testing yourself in the stage environment playing music.In some cases, depending on the band you're fronting, it may become more important to be a good entertainer than it is to be a good singer. It won't always be this way though, as it depends on the combination of singing and presentation of your band. You need to interpret the music on stage. Practice your posture. It may not seem like it, but good posture is essential to both good singing and great stage presence. Bad posture can cramp the sound leaving your body and can cause people to think you'd rather shrink to the back of the stage than take it front and center.

"['stay calm', 'laugh it off', 'stay in the present', 'spend some time thinking over past embarrassing situations']",How to Cope if You Pee Yourself Laughing in Public2," Remember that this is really not the biggest problem in the world to have. Everything is relative. If a little embarrassment is the worst problem you will ever experience, you’re lucky. If you become flustered and react intensely, this can spur a reaction in others, creating an uncomfortable situation for everyone. Instead, try to keep your cool.It’s possible that no one will notice or be able to see anyway. It might feel wet to you, but the pee stain may be barely visible to other people around you because of where it’s located. Try to stay relaxed and slip away. If someone does see, remain calm. People often react to embarrassment by becoming flustered, tearful, stuttering, and acting upset overall. This makes the people around you feel awkward as well, causing a tense situation. While it can be incredibly embarrassing to have an accident in public, staying calm can help smooth things over. If anyone notices, try to react with a smile and take it with a grain of salt. You can proceed to do things to help quell your embarrassment.  , How you respond to something can affect how other people around you respond to it, so your attitude can make the situation more or less embarrassing. Adopt a confident attitude, and try to laugh off the mistake.In hindsight, embarrassing events are easy to laugh off. People often share embarrassing stories at cocktail parties. In the moment, however, laughing can be hard. Try to remind yourself you will live down this moment. This may make you feel more comfortable laughing. Even if it feels uncomfortable, try your best to laugh it off. Say something like, “Can you believe I just did that? I guess your joke was really funny.” Speak with confidence, and downplay the significance of what just happened. Enlist a friend's help. If you're feeling sensitive, it may be difficult to laugh at yourself. Try to turn to a trusted friend and encourage him or her to laugh with you. Make a joke at your own expense and say, ""Am I right?"" If your friend joins in, the conversation can go from uncomfortable to fun and lighthearted.  , If you want to overcome embarrassment, work on moving forward. Instead of dwelling on what has just occurred, keep your mind in the present. You peed your pants, and now you must deal. Ruminating on the embarrassment will block your ability to smoothly cope with the situation.Try to silence the voice in your head. You may be inclined to think something like, ""I can't believe you just did that. How humiliating."" Try to ignore the words of self judgment. Instead, focus on what you can do now, in the present, to deal with the situation. Keep pulling your attention to the present as need be. Remind yourself you need to get to a bathroom, cover the stain, or laugh it off with those around you.  , You may feel you'll never live down peeing yourself in public. However, try to remind yourself of embarrassing things you've done in the past. This is probably not your first cringe-worthy moment. Remembering past embarrassments can help put things in perspective. You never thought you would get over certain fumbles, but eventually you did.Go over a list of your most embarrassing moments. Replay that uncomfortable first date, that awkward comment you made in English class, and so on. Try to recall your top five embarrassing moments. Think to yourself, ""I got over all of that and I will get over this as well."" Try to enlist your friends to help. Have friends share embarrassing stories as well. You may feel better about yourself if you realize everyone has experienced embarrassing moments.  ","['calm', 'past embarrassing situations', 'time']"
"['consider the incubation period', 'spot general signs of ill health', 'check your dog for lameness', 'monitor the lameness for three to four days', 'check to see if your dog has enlarged lymph nodes']",How to Recognize Lyme's Disease in Dogs1," The incubation period for Lyme's disease is 2 to 5 months. This means that it could take your dog several months to develop symptoms after he has been bit.If you find a tick on your dog, remove it and then monitor your dog for symptoms over the next several months.; , Dogs with Lyme's disease develop several non-specific signs of ill health. These signs include:   Fever: A dog's temperature is normally 37.9 to 39.0 Celsius. A dog is considered feverish if his temperature is above 39.5 Celsius. The dog may radiate an unusual amount of heat from his body. His paws and nose may feel hot to the touch. He may pant, even in a cool room, and his coat may look dull. Anorexia: This includes a loss of appetite. A dog that does not eat for several days is in no immediate danger, other than losing weight, but it is a significant general sign of ill health, especially in a normally hungry dog. Depression: This means the dog loses interest in things he would normally find exciting. This means he chooses to lay in his bed, rather than go for a walk or come running to greet you when you come in from work.  , Lyme's disease has a strong link to lameness. The Borrelia may grow in your dog’s joints or muscles. When this happens, your dog’s body will begin to fight the invasion, which will cause the area to become inflamed. This inflammation can lead to soreness, pain, and lameness. While lameness can occur for reasons other than Lyme's disease (such as arthritis, infection, sprains, and cancer), the symptoms commonly associated with Lyme's disease-induced lameness include:   Acute lameness: This is another way of saying a sudden-onset lameness. Your dog may have been fine the previous day, but wakes up the next feeling dull, feverish, and with marked lameness in one or more legs. Joint Pain: The affected joint(s) become swollen and warm. They are also tender or painful when touched. If in doubt, compare your dog’s lame leg to his other corresponding leg. The lame leg may look larger or feel hotter than the other. Walking Stiffly: If the joints in the spine are affected, your dog may walk stiffly with his back hunched and arched. When you stroke his back, he may flinch as if in pain.  , The lameness caused by Lyme’s disease often lasts for only 3 to 4 days, and responds readily to antibiotic therapy with oxytetracycline antibiotics. If left untreated the lameness may resolve but the dog is at risk of going on to develop later clinical signs of the disease (this is discussed in the next section).  , When the body mounts an immune response, the lymph nodes may become flooded with cells ready to fight infection, which causes them to physically enlarge. It is difficult for untrained people to feel these lymph nodes in their dogs, but if they are swollen you may be able to see quail's eggs sized bumps under the skin. When you run fingers over the bumps you will feel a smooth, round swelling.   Common sites of lymph node enlargement are the prescapular (in front of the left and right shoulders) and popliteal (at the back of the left and right knees).

To make it as an entrepreneur, you must be willing to work seven days out of the week. This will often involve long, sleepless nights of coming up with new ideas and working out solutions to problems that spring up along the way. Before you take on the challenge, be sure that you have the determination to stick with it.Your new distillery won’t be making any money in its infancy. Unless you have a benefactor or receive a sizable business loan, you’ll likely have to juggle the responsibilities of devising a business strategy while working other jobs to pay the rent. Speak to other entrepreneurs who have opened their own distilleries and ask if they have any helpful advice to share with you.; , There’s a lot of legal regulation surrounding breweries, distilleries and other businesses that manufacture and sell alcohol. First, you’ll have to obtain a distiller’s permit from the appropriate government agency. Following that, you’ll need to be approved for a liquor license and other applicable permits at the state or local level. Without the proper paperwork, you won’t be able to move forward with opening your distillery.Those living in the United States can visit the website of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to complete the application process for a distiller's permit, as well as request additional information and materials.The legal processes involved with starting a distillery are straightforward, but can be time-consuming. It’s best to get started as soon as you’ve made up your mind to pursue your goal., To be the best you can possibly be at what you do, you’ll need to become a walking encyclopedia of liquor-related knowledge. Sample as many liquors as you can, visit other distilleries and keep your eyes and ears open for new developments in the industry. Always be looking to expand your knowledge on both the practical and business end of things.Get in the habit of trying new brands and brews regularly. You should have a wealth of firsthand experience to be able to articulate the differences between your product and others. Attend distillery festivals and special events whenever possible. These types of events usually feature an enormous selection of craft spirits, and can provide a great hands-on learning opportunity.  , What can you do to make your distillery stand out among your competitors? You might plan on employing an inventive hybrid distilling method or incorporating never-before-seen ingredients into the mix. Or perhaps you’re determined to introduce people who don’t drink gin to the beverage in an enjoyable way. Whatever your approach may be, you should aim to proceed with a clear purpose in mind.If you’re unable to come up with a clear answer to this question, you’ll likely have a harder time turning your brand into something truly special. While trying other liquors, make a list of what works, what’s missing and what could be done better. Direct comparison will put you on the right track to crafting a beverage that hits all the right notes., Opening a distillery involves applying for a business license, leasing a suitable property, buying a lot of expensive equipment, and hiring help. To be able to meet these demands, you’ll need to appeal to outside investors for capital. In most cases, you’ll need to be able to come up with $350,000—500,000 to make a brand new distillery work.For most upstarts, pitching your business to a committee of private investors is the simplest way to go. One major advantage of this method is that you’ll have far more money up front to work with. The downside, however, is that you’ll have to give up partial control over the decisions and direction of your company to the investors, who will then own a share. As an alternative, consider boosting your finances via crowdsourcing. Through resources like Indiegogo, Kickstarter or EquityNet, you may be able to collect enough money in personal donations to pay for the basic necessities. Furthermore, popular funding will allow you to retain full ownership of the business., It may be that you have friends, relatives or other associates who might be eager to get involved in this business undertaking with you. Surround yourself with like-minded people who share your passion and want to see your vision become a reality. Having a team you can trust is invaluable asset in building a business from the ground up.Give close associates the chance to become co-investors and have an equal say in shaping the business.  , Shop around for a physical headquarters for your distillery. Some possible options include small, freestanding workshops, warehouse buildings or spacious storefronts. Make sure that your projected startup budget will allow you to pay the lease on your property and have enough leftover to carry out your distilling operations comfortably.Map out a radius where you’d prefer to set up your distillery and explore the vicinity to check out what’s available. Enlist the aid of a commercial realtor. These agents will familiarize you with the properties listed in your area, and can often alert you to locations that you otherwise would have never come across., Sooner or later, you're going to need a few extra sets of hands. Working with a dedicated team will help you stick to a busy production schedule and give you a much needed break from handling every aspect of the business yourself. In the beginning, your staff will probably be fairly small. As your distillery grows in size and renown, you can think about adding brewmasters, bottlers, delivery drivers, marketing specialists and other employees to your team.Conduct in-person interviews to get a sense of your prospective employee's relevant qualifications, experience and enthusiasm for your brand.Make sure you budget properly so that you'll be able to pay your staff fairly without eating into your profits.  , No one will take notice of your brand if you’re putting out the same sort of product that everyone else is. Draw from diverse distilling traditions or experiment with using unorthodox ingredients in your brews. Ultimately, your distillery’s popularity might even come down to its unique packaging and labeling, which will attract the attention of first-time tasters.   Think back on your plans for how to add something new to the market and use them as inspiration to generate specific product and marketing ideas. For example, a niche market may exist for people who ordinarily prefer cocktails. By infusing your liquors with sweet, fruity or zesty flavors, you stand to reach a larger consumer base., What’s a distillery without stills? These are these first thing you’ll need to procure before you can get your distillery up and running. Decide whether it would be better to run with one or two small stills or invest in a large one that can handle a high rate of output. Along with a trustworthy still, you’ll require additional equipment like a boiler, mash tun and storage tanks, just to name a few.Good stills are not cheap. Top-of-the-line varieties often go for between $50,000—250,000, which will constitute a big portion of your startup money.Look into whether it’s possible to get some of your equipment secondhand. Be sure to verify that everything is in good working order before you commit to buying, though., Running a distillery isn't as simple as just churning out liquor. It will be important to think over the little considerations, as well, such as where your water will be coming from, how often supply orders should be placed to maintain productivity and what if any services will need to be subcontracted. These might not seem like major concerns, but the way you go about handling them can make or break a young business.It may also be necessary to meet with your city's alcoholic beverage commission to get a rundown on the most up-to-date liquor laws.Don't be discouraged if it all seems a little overwhelming at first. In many ways, learning the ins and outs of owning a business is a work in progress. Each time you face a difficult task or unexpected obstacle, you'll be better equipped to deal with it in the future.  , Before you can jump right into the brewing process, you’ll need to contract with a supplier who can provide you with the various things you’ll need to brew your signature liquors. This will include things like yeast, grains, fruits, spices and raw alcohol spirits. Take your time selecting high-quality ingredients that are consistent with your distilling philosophy.Take advantage of local co-ops and markets that grow organic grains and produce. Liquors sourced with local ingredients are a big hit with alcohol enthusiasts and may prove to be a beneficial selling point.Give your proprietary recipes a test run with friends, family and other connoisseurs before putting them into production., While specialty aged liquors are the most sought-after, they unfortunately take months or years to take on their potent, complex flavors. If you’re planning on distilling fine aged liquors, focus on cranking out “white” spirits in the early stages, such as vodka, gin or white whiskey, as these don’t require as much fermentation. This is a good way to get your product into people’s hands and make enough profit to keep the business afloat while your more refined batches have a chance to properly season.Darker liquors like scotch, rum and brandy are aged in wooden barrels, which is where they get their deep color and flavor.Offering a range of liquors is typically no more costly, and can potentially increase your profit margin by appealing to many different tastes.  , It’s unlikely that your distillery will become a commercial success overnight. It may take years or even decades to establish a reputation that will put you on the map. If you’re truly passionate about what you’re doing, though, don’t give up. As your practical skills and understanding of the many facets of distilling liquors grow, so will your business.Expect to put in the most work during the first few months while you’re still getting off the ground.

Starting early allows you to get your body in peak condition before you focus on specific skills.You will start with base training, which increases your body's cardiovascular fitness and trains you for endurance sports. After a month or two of base training, you will move to more intense phases, in which you are actively training for the race while also strengthening your skills and technique in the various disciplines that are tested during an adventure race. Allowing at least six months to train for your first adventure race ensures that you can both train and participate in the adventure race safely, and that your body is in peak condition.; , A strong foundation of aerobic fitness ensures you have the strength to endure long hours on even the toughest endurance course. Start your training slow to build your aerobic fitness and make your body more efficient.Working at a lower intensity builds your body's aerobic fitness and trains you for endurance. Your body will burn fat rather than carbs, which helps you sustain energy during endurance activities. Ideally, you'll want to spend at least 12 weeks in the base training phase of your training. After that, you can work into the build phase, when you improve your skills in the various disciplines. You'll gradually ramp up the intensity of your training sessions until you reach your peak within weeks of the race itself. Invest in a heart-rate monitor (if you don't already have one) and keep track of your heart rate while conditioning. During base training, you shouldn't move beyond the first two zones, the recovery and endurance zones. This equates to between 50 and 70 percent of your maximum heart rate. At your peak training level, you'll be working at around 80 percent of your maximum heart rate.  , Since adventure racing is an endurance sport, your conditioning workouts need to be at least as long as the race itself is going to be. Training yourself to go longer will make a shorter race easier and give you more room to increase your pace.If your adventure race is more than 12 hours long, use a marathon training plan. Try to do most of your running on trails rather than on a paved road. If your adventure race is less than 12 hours in duration, you can follow a half-marathon plan. You can spend as little as three or four days a week training, but you may want to train for five or six days a week, particularly when you are doing lower intensity exercise during your base training stage. Remember that an adventure race is an endurance event. You're not going to train for a 12-hour race by working out 20 minutes a day three or four days a week. Not training enough is a good way to ensure you'll get wiped out – or worse, injured – within the first few hours of the race.  , When you have a grueling adventure race in mind, it can be easy to go too hard during your first weeks of training. However, pushing your body to its limit during conditioning can lead to injury.Your training is a time to focus on your skills and technique. When you're working at full intensity it's difficult to correct your form or even pay attention to small details. Lower intensity workouts, on the other hand, give you the opportunity to make small tweaks that will increase the efficiency of your movements during the race. Working at a high intensity is a good way to get injured during training and never even get to the race – especially if you're training nearly every day. Training at a lower intensity means you don't need as much recovery time between training sessions.  , Hiking and hill-climbing work different muscle groups than running or walking on flat ground, so after a month or so of base training you can start to incorporate these activities into your routine.During your hill climbing, stay at about 80 percent effort to continue to build your endurance. Try several sets of a hill that takes less than five minutes to climb. Start including interval training into your overall regimen to continue building cardiovascular strength and efficiency while you also build your strength. Include scrambling up hills on varieties of terrain, including mud and slippery slopes. This activity also uses different muscle groups, and you want to make sure all are as evenly conditioned as possible. Replicate a variety of race conditions as much as possible, so you'll be ready regardless of what happens in the race.  , Review the information for your particular adventure race and figure out which disciplines will be included. That way you can start dividing your training sessions up so that each discipline is covered equally.Keep in mind that if you're less familiar with one discipline, you'll need to spend more time with it – at least initially – to bring your skills up to speed with everything else. Hire a good trainer or coach to teach you correct technique for disciplines with which you have little to no experience. It's important to learn basic safety skills and first aid in tandem with technique. For example, while you should work on a good paddling technique and an efficient stroke, you also should learn basic water and boat safety so you don't panic if your boat overturns. For disciplines that may occur after nightfall, make sure you do training at night so you're accustomed to moving in the dark.  , Throughout your training, you want to carry a 10-15 pound pack with items similar to what you'll be carrying during the race itself. You also want to wear similar clothing and the same shoes in which you plan to run the race.While training, you'll be able to tell if your pack is uncomfortable. You also can make sure that food and water is easily accessible to you when you need it, and make adjustments where necessary. This will keep you from panicking during the race if you can't get to something you need. Wearing trail shoes provides more support and protection for your feet, and provide much better grip and traction on soft or slippery terrain. They can also keep you from getting blisters like you potentially would if you wore regular running shoes. Take care of your feet and remove calluses to avoid getting deep blisters during the race. Especially if you're training during the day, wear sunscreen year-round and insect repellant in warmer months. Make sure you train with team members or with a coach or buddy – don't go hiking alone, even on a familiar trail where you've been many times. Include general items in your pack such as duct tape and rope that can easily be converted into makeshift assistance or support for a team member in trouble, as well as basic first aid supplies.  , Many adventure race competitors are triathletes, which means rowing may not be their strongest discipline. Focusing on your paddling can enable you to build a significant time lead in the race if you have a strong, efficient stroke.Keep in mind that you could be paddling in any kind of water, so make sure you have experience in everything from placid lakes to whitewater, even ocean swells if your adventure race will be held near the coast. Focus on keeping your arms fully extended, and get your power from your core rather than from your arms. Use the twisting of your body to generate your stroke, not movement in your arms. Find a canoe or kayak club that you can paddle with to get more experience in racing-type conditions. Practicing in a boat without a rudder is ideal, since you'll have experience steering a rudderless craft. Many of the boats provided by adventure race organizers are rudderless. Try to fit in at least one or two long paddle sessions of between one and two hours over the course of your training. Long strokes with good form will get you across the body of water faster than a greater number of short strokes.  , Not only is training in a group motivational, but there is always safety in numbers – especially if you're training in wooded areas far from the beaten path. Team members and training partners can help you out as well as giving you tips on how to improve your form and technique.Ideally, your team members will be skilled in different disciplines, so you can rely on each other to push the team forward on each leg of the race and give each team member a chance to lead. Include others who are skilled in specific disciplines, such as rowing or climbing, so you can learn new techniques from them. During your training, you will likely be exposed to situations that will enable you to figure out how you can help other team members out if disaster strikes out on the trail.  , While affixing a large light to your bike will add considerable weight, it will be worth it for the safety it provides – especially if you're biking on a difficult or technical trail.Use LED lights since they weigh less. You may also want to wear an LED headlamp.   Keep in mind that trails typically aren't lit at all, and often one wrong turn could send you tumbling off into a ravine. Both in training and in the race itself, you shouldn't sacrifice safety in the belief that you'll make your load lighter. Rig your bikes with towlines and hooks so you can get bikes out of bad situations if need be. Retractable dog leashes can work well as towlines and won't take up a lot of room in your pack. Practice riding on your teammates' bikes as well as your own so if you have to switch bikes or bike parts for some reason you'll still be comfortable.  , Some adventure races include a climbing or rappelling component. While you may be able to go around these rock faces, you'll lose precious time doing so.Unless you're going on a longer adventure race or an expedition race, you may not have much use for climbing skills. Check the information for your adventure race carefully so you can plan your training time accordingly. Practicing rappelling with your team also enhances trust and bonding among team members, which will be a crucial mental component going into the race. When you're doing any climbing, make sure your pack is secured and your hair is tied back out of your face. You don't want anything to get caught up in your rappelling equipment, or to fall off the side of a cliff.  , When you register for your adventure race, you'll receive detailed information about the course of the race, the obstacles or challenges you will face, and the skills that will be tested.Use this information as a blueprint for your training regimen. If there's any component of the race in which you have little experience, use your training time to get comfortable with that skill and learn how to complete that leg of the race safely. Study the route the race will take until you're relatively familiar with it. If you have the opportunity to do so, you may want to do part of your training in the same area where the race itself will take place.  , Almost all adventure races have a navigation element, which will require you to read and understand a topographical map and navigate using a compass. In the age of GPS systems, this may be an area where you need a lot of practice.Shortchanging this aspect of preparation or assuming you'll be able to pick it up on the fly can have serious negative consequences for you and your teammates during the race. Buy a book or research orienteering online, and study until you have the basics down. Then you may want to consider joining an orienteering club or attending a class or camp so you can test your skills in a real-world situation. If you do join a club, pay attention to the technique of more seasoned members. Ask questions, and pick up as many tricks and shortcuts as you can to make this skill easier for you to do quickly and efficiently.  , In the days before the race, make sure all equipment is functioning properly and any systems you've rigged will actually perform as you've designed them to perform.Test safety devices and harnesses to make sure they're going to operate correctly if you need them during the race. Make sure you know everything you have and how to access it. You also should know what your teammates are carrying and how they can access their gear. Pack plenty of food and water for everyone, including sports gels for energy and other snacks that can be eaten quickly for efficient fuel on the trail.  , An adventure race is a team sport. Whether you have a single partner or a larger team, your bond with each other is perhaps more important than your speed and skill. Work together with commitment to each other and you will be successful.During training as well as during the race itself, be aware of your teammates at all times. If someone is having a problem, you'll need to be able to help them as a team and get them back in the race. All team members should have mutual respect for each other and treat the event as a team effort rather than an individual effort or accomplishment. Get to know your teammates and their strengths and weaknesses. Be willing to put your ego aside if need be for the good of the team as a whole.  , On the day of the race, you will likely be excited and nervous. This kind of stress will not allow your body to operate at peak efficiency. Meditation and relaxation techniques calm your body and help you mentally prepare for the race.Visualization is a technique that works for many athletes. Much of your nervousness comes from anticipation of something unknown. Visualize yourself in your mind calmly overcoming the obstacles and running swiftly over trails. Deep breathing exercises also can work to relax your body and mind. As you inhale, think of energy coming into your body. Expand your chest and hold your breath for a few seconds. As you exhale, think of stress and fatigue that you are releasing from your body. Use the techniques that work for you. For example, if one of your teammates swears by meditation but you don't get any benefit from it, respect that you and your teammates might have differences in mentally preparing and keep open minded towards your teammates.

You can talk loudly on the bus, on a plane, or especially in a coffee shop while people are trying to get work done. It's especially annoying if you talk loudly on the phone, acting like no one else is around. If you reveal personal information, or just make really obnoxious comments, then you are guaranteed to annoy the people around you.   If someone asks you to be quiet, you should nod vigorously and apologize, and continue like before.; , Ah, the phone. Probably the most annoying device you have in your possession. If you're at work or school, or even just having lunch at a cafe, leave it on, preferably with a very annoying song that comes on whenever it rings. Think something like, ""Taking Care of Business"" or ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" so that when your phone rings, everyone is utterly distracted. You can even make this sound your alarm, so it sounds like someone is calling when no one is. Bonus points if it takes you forever to find your phone so everyone gets to hear the entirety of the annoying sound or ring tone.   It's also pretty annoying to put your phone on vibrate. You may think that this is almost the same as putting your phone on silent, when in fact, everyone can hear your phone vibrate and can get annoyed by it, especially if you're in a particularly quiet place. This is perfect when you're having a long textual exchange with a friend, so that your phone will go off every few seconds.  , Though you should avoid approaching someone who may lash out at you or get very angry, if you really want to be annoying, then you can try to strike up a convo with someone who is obviously very busy, whether that person is studying for a test, working on his novel on his computer, or just reading with intense concentration. Act like you're completely oblivious and are just looking to chat someone up. When the person answers in one-word answers, ignore this and try to keep the conversation going.   You can say, ""What are you reading? I heard that book was pretty lame,"" or make other offensive comments about what the person is doing as an opener. Talk on and on about yourself, making eye contact so the other person would feel bad about turning you away.  , This is another way to be pretty irritating in public. Repeatedly drop your books, spill your coffee, or just generally act like a mess who can't keep track of his or her stuff. The more you spill, the merrier. You can also bring shaving cream and when someone gets up to go to the bathroom you can poor the shaving cream all over the persons seat and this will really drive the person nuts and spill it all over the persons laptop. Make as much racket as you can so people feel forced to look up and maybe even to help you out. If you spill or drop your stuff in a way that crowd's someone else's personal space, then that will be even more annoying.   It'll be even more annoying if you don't apologize when this happens! Or, if you apologize way more than necessary so people feel sorry for you.  , Staring at people is another solid plan for irritating them. Just pick a stranger and stare at him or her for a prolonged period of time. You can even leave your mouth gaping open as you do this. When the person stares at you, scratch your head and continue to stare. Act like you're trying to win a staring contest and try to avoid blinking for as long as possible. Just be careful — try to stare at someone who seems nice and who wouldn't get too angry about this. Remember that your goal is to irritate the person, not infuriate him or her.  , Being nosy around strangers is another great way to irritate people. Let's say you're in line getting coffee and you hear two women talking in hushed tones about one of their divorces or another personal subject. Butt in and say, ""I couldn't help but overhear..."" and then offer an annoying opinion on something you know nothing about. If you really want to be annoying, you can even try to argue with the people about the topic.   Act like you're not being nosy and that butting in is your right. This is guaranteed to be irritating. You can also be nosy and irritating by asking a stranger a person question. You can say something like, ""Do you know a good gynecologist around here?"" or ""I was just wondering, where do you get shoes that look so ratty like that?""  , Act like you've just been blasted out of the past. Wander around and act amazed at every little bit of technology you see. If you see someone using a phone, you can say something like, ""Oh my God, is that a telephone? Like, you can actually talk to someone through that thing? Jeez."" If you see someone on his or her laptop, you can walk up to it and say, ""You can communicate with the future on that thing! How absolutely fascinating!""   The important thing is not to break character. If the people see you smiling, then they'll get really mad. Otherwise, they are liable to think you're a little crazy and won't know what to do with you.  , This is the perfect way to irritate your friends. If you want them to get tired of you, fast, then you should try to copy and mimic everything your friend says and does. You can either be totally obvious about it, and just repeat everything your friend says, word for word, or you can be a bit more subtle, and copy your friend's gestures and movements instead. The obvious route will be more annoying, but your friend will tire of you faster. If you mimic everything your friend does, then it'll take longer for your friend to catch on.   Act like a mirror. Do everything your friend does but in reverse. If your friend asks you why you are mimicking him or her, act like you have no idea what your friend is talking about.  , Another great way to annoy your friends is to complain as much as you can. Everyone hates a whiner or a person who complains just for the sake of it. It's even better if you complain about completely pointless things, like the weather or something you saw on TV, so your problems don't sound all that serious. If you repeat the same complaint over and over, that is also likely to be pretty darn irritating.   It's best if you whine with an annoying look on your face and an annoying whiny sound to your voice. Make your own company as unpleasant as possible.  , People who are narcissistic or just plain obsessed with themselves are extremely irritating. When you're with your friends, make sure you use the word ""I"" as much as you can and to talk about your own problems and what you have going on as much as possible. When your friends try to talk about themselves, change the subject or say you suddenly have to go. This will irritate absolutely everyone.   This act will be difficult to keep up for long. Your friends will run far and away! It's most effective if you tell long, boring stories about yourself without letting anyone interrupt you. If your friends have heard the story before, then all the better!  , Another perfect way to irritate your friends is to promise that you'll be somewhere and then completely flake on them. It's best if you act totally sincere, like you are absolutely set on going to the movies or giving your friend a ride to a party. Then, at the last possible second, make up a lame excuse for why you can't go, so you leave your friend hanging.   If you're really determined to be completely irritating, then you should not get back to your friend until hours later, so your friend is left wondering where the heck you are. Then, give some dumb excuse like, ""Sorry! I got sucked in to a Buffy marathon!""  , Another way to be extremely irritating is to invite yourself over to hang out with your friends when they obviously want some time away from you. If you hear your two friends talking about how much they want to catch up, then ask what time you can be there. If your friend was just talking about how much she needs alone time, ask if you can crash at her place for a bit. Act completely oblivious about not being wanted.   If you see your friends talking in hushed tones about something that is obviously serious, just walk right over and say, ""What's up, guys?""  , This is another extremely irritating habit that you can adopt. Ask your friend if you can borrow her favorite sweater, her favorite book, or a piece of jewelry that you think will be perfect for your new outfit. Then, keep promising to give the thing back without actually doing it. This is guaranteed to irritate your friends, and even to help you lose the item.   If your friend's things have sentimental value, then losing them will be extra irritating.  , One of the most irritating things you can do is to spill your friend's secrets. If your friend tells you something that is meant to be private, then you can try to let other people know. Obviously, use your discretion — if it's something truly personal, then it's best to back off, but if it's just something a bit embarrassing or silly, then you can ""accidentally"" mention it in front of your other friends or even on your Facebook.   If you want to be really irritating, act totally oblivious when your friend calls you out for doing what you did. Say something like, ""I thought everyone knew!"" Or, ""I didn't know it was such a big deal. Jeez!""  , This is one guaranteed way of irritating your sibling. If you have an older sister, help yourself to her clothes and jewelry. It's extra irritating for you to show up to school wearing her things without her realizing it. You can also use your brother's video games or sports equipment, and even bring them over to a friend's house. When your sibling gets mad at you, you can act like you didn't know you did anything wrong. Say something like, ""Ooops, sorry, I thought that was mine!""   If you want to be really irritating, then when your sibling brings home his or her favorite treat, try to eat as much of it as you can. When you shower, try to use up your brother or sister's favorite shampoo. Use your brother or sister's hairbrush, trying to leave as many strands of your hair in there as you can.  , There's nothing a sibling hates more than being bothered by another sibling when his or her friends are over. So, if your sibling is having a sleepover or just having a few friends over, you should try to be around as much as possible, bug your sibling, make ridiculous comments, or just ask if you can play, too. If your sibling keeps telling you to go away, find excuses to be around, like pretending you're looking for something in the room where your sibling is, humming to yourself loudly as you do this.   You can also embarrass your sibling by bringing up embarrassing stories or saying things like, ""Hey, where did you put your retainer?"" Or, ""It's so nice that you finally found some friends.""  , Another classic way to irritate your sibling is to tell your parents every wrong thing he or she does. It can be really minor, like not washing the dishes when he or she said she would. Do it was often as possible and make your sibling feel like he is constantly being watched by you. If you keep this up, you are likely to irritate your parents, too!   It's even better if you convince your sibling to do something bad or even do it along with him and then tattle on him, saying, ""It was all his idea!""  , Siblings hate living with messy brothers or sisters, especially if they share a room. If you're lucky enough to share a room with your favorite brother or sister, then you should leave your clothes all over the place and make sure to be so messy that it makes it hard for your sibling to find his own stuff. You can also squirt some toothpaste into the sink, leave your food all over the place, or just do whatever you can to create chaos in your sibling's orbit.   Of course, this may not last for long because your parents will ask you to clean up, but it will be very irritating for as long as you can pull it off!  , Nothing is more annoying than whining and acting like a big baby until you get what you want. If you want to really drive your sibling crazy, then the next time you want something, whether it's to have a bite of your brother's pizza or to use your sister's computer, you should whine, complain, or even cry until you're so irritating that you just have to get your way.   There is no age limit to this one. Crying and whining when you're 16 can be even more irritating because your sibling will feel embarrassed for you!  , This is another great way to completely not respect your sibling's privacy and to cause as much embarrassment as possible. The next time you know your brother will have his girlfriend over, you should try to be around as much as possible, being loud and annoying, and making comments like, ""I'm so glad you finally found a date. Remember when you were crying about how no one would go out with you?""   You can even sing the K-I-S-S-I-N-G song or just keep asking your sibling and his or her special someone when they're going to kiss each other. This will be especially irritating if they haven't done it yet!  , There are times when nothing can be more annoying to a teacher than rolling in to class a minute or two late. This is most annoying if you apologize with a dumb smirk on your face, or just walk in looking cool and collected, like you couldn't care less about how your teacher is actually feeling, or like the class is your absolute last priority.   It can also be pretty irritating if you show up just as the bell is ringing so the teacher can't actually say anything. If you shuffle through your things and take a long time to get settled after you show up late, that will be even more irritating!  , Another way to really irritate your teacher is to ask questions that are so obvious that they make it clear that you haven't been paying attention at all. If you're in an Algebra class, ask something like, ""What does X mean again?"" Or another question that makes the teacher have to go back to the beginning, or just to get annoyed that you haven't been paying attention.   You can also wait until you go over something in depth, acting like you're not paying attention. When the lesson is almost over, ask a question that shows you haven't been paying attention at all. You can even say something like, ""Sorry, I must have totally zoned out!"" You can also ask really silly or irrelevant questions like, ""What color was Ben Franklin's hair?""  , Some teachers get the most irritated by students who act like know-it-alls. Let's face it. It's pretty likely that your teacher knows more about the subject material than you, and if you act like your teacher is wrong, ask her to prove what she said, or even try to look up some facts from class on Wikipedia to show how wrong they are, then you are guaranteed to irritate your teacher.   It's also annoying if you try to quote a different teacher or your parents to show that your teacher is wrong.  , Teachers absolutely hate it when their students sleep in class. If you want to be very irritating, then you should try to do this as much as you can. Bonus points if you can snore or make the other students giggle. Sleeping in class won't help your grade any, but it will definitely irritate your teachers. It'll be extra irritating if you wake up out of sleep just long enough to ask an obvious question.  , It's bad enough if you're determined to be annoying on your own, but if you bring other students into the equation, that will be even more irritating for your teachers. Pass notes to the other students, crack stupid jokes, or just get them involved in conversation. Be so funny and goofy that other students can't help but pay more attention to you than the teacher. This is bound to be exceptionally irritating, especially if you get students who are normally well-behaved to start acting out!   Show other students a hilarious YouTube video. This is bound to be irritating for at least a few seconds before your phone gets taken away.  , Another way to irritate your teachers is to finish your test way too early so you make the other students nervous. Wait a reasonable amount of time so that it could possibly seem like you might have breezed through the questions, but not so long that other people may be almost done. Once you ""finish,"" say ""Done!"" or even, ""That was easy!"" Turn in your test with swagger, slam down your pencil, and maybe even kick your feet up. Do whatever you can to be distracting and irritating and to make the other students nervous.   This is bound to drive your teacher crazy, especially if she spent a lot of time preparing students for the exam!

"['start your baby’s sleep routine early', 'give your baby a bath', 'give your baby a massage', 'get your baby dressed for bed', 'dim the lights', 'try reading a bedtime story', 'turn on soothing music', 'ease your baby into sleeping in the nursery']",How to Make Your Baby's Nursery Soothing Enough for Sleep3," If you wait until your baby is sleepy to start the routine, then your baby will be overtired by the time they are ready for bed. At nap times and bedtime, babies have a ""sleep window"" when they are just starting to get tired, but are not so tired that they've become irritable. Once your baby passes their “sleep window,” their body begins to produce cortisol, which is a stress hormone that will make it more difficult for them to fall asleep and to stay asleep.Every baby is different, but if your baby is over 4 months old, they might be ready to sleep anywhere between 5 and 7:30pm. Note that newborns don’t have a scheduled bedtime since they are still developing circadian rhythms. Until your baby is a few months old, it won’t be necessary to establish a night time routine.  , This is not necessarily a mandatory step, but many parents use a nightly bath as a way to help their babies understand that they are getting ready for bed.A warm bath is relaxing and also a good bonding experience for you and your baby.  , Giving your baby a massage will help them relax even more and is a great way to bond with your baby. You can use baby lotion or baby oil, and massage your baby’s arms, legs, belly, and neck for 10 to 15 minutes after bath time.Massage their legs by gently wrapping your hand around their thigh and then sliding your hand down from the thigh to the ankle. Repeat this on the other leg. Use a gentle clockwise motion with your fingertips to massage their belly. You can massage baby's arms using the same technique used for the legs. Wrap your hand around your baby’s upper arm and then slide your hand down to their wrist. Repeat on the other arm. To massage your baby’s neck, support your baby’s head and upper body in one hand. With the other hand, place your thumb on one side of your baby’s neck, and then wrap your hand under baby’s neck and place your index finger and middle finger on the other side. Use your fingers to gently massage in a circular motion.  , If you have a brand new baby, you may choose to swaddle your baby as this is very soothing for infants. If your baby is older than two months, you should dress them in pajamas based on the temperature. If it is during the warm summer months (over 75 degrees Fahrenheit or 23 C) then your baby probably only needs one layer of clothing. If it is under 75F (23 C) then your baby may need a few more layers to stay warm.A good rule of thumb is that your baby should be dressed in one layer more than you need to be comfortable in the room., Dimming the lights will signal to your baby that it’s time to sleep. You can do this by turning on a soft lamp in your baby’s nursery. If you have an overhead light with a dimmer switch, simply turn the lights down low enough so that your baby will relax, but high enough so that you can still read a book and move around without hurting yourself.When you leave the room, turn the light all the way off so the room is dark enough for your baby to stay asleep.  , Hearing your soft, relaxed voice will be soothing and relaxing for your baby. Try to speak softly and slowly so that your baby will begin to get drowsy.Alternatively, you can also just talk to your baby. For example, tell them about your day. Especially with very young babies, it doesn’t matter much what you are saying. Hearing your voice will be comforting and relaxing.  , Classical music such as baroque or nature sounds can be very relaxing and help to make your baby’s nursery a soothing sanctuary. There are several sleep apps to help babies sleep such as Baby Snooze, Baby Shusher or Lullaby for Babies.Turn on some soothing music in your baby’s room before you put your baby to bed., If you have been co-sleeping with your baby, or if they have been sleeping in the same room with you, it could be a bit distressing for your baby to sleep alone in the nursery at first (depending on the child). You can help ease your baby into sleeping in the nursery by beginning with just one nap alone in the nursery each day. Gradually increase the number of naps your baby takes alone until they are able to sleep at night in the nursery.It can be hard for a parent to be away from their baby. Try to remind yourself that it is healthy for both of you if you are able to spend a bit of time out of each other’s sight. This will also help your baby learn to fall asleep without you there.

The Xbox should stand on its narrow end with the vent facing up.This cleaning process can be somewhat long and tedious, especially the first time. Smear some war paint under your eyes and get ready to wage war on the dirt and dust clogging your Xbox.; , Gently slide the screwdriver into the farthest right vent slot on the vent. Pry the vent with firm, moderate pressure until it partially pops free. Use your fingers to continue prying the vent up with moderate pressure until it releases.When prying with your screwdriver, use your free hand to assist the screwdriver by pressing upwards on the end of the vent.  , Use your fingernail to lift the lip of the silver or black panel border at the right back corner of the Xbox. In the space on the inside of the border, there will be three release tabs that look like small slots: one on the right, one at the middle, and one on the left.When lifting the border part of the Xbox, you’ll likely need to continue exerting pressure on it with your hand to keep the release tabs accessible. There are six total release tabs for each side panel, three along each long side. These tabs are positioned similarly for both side panels., Insert your screwdriver into the slot at the right, back corner. Press forward slightly while prying up on the panel with your free hand. When the tab disengages, that corner of the side panel should pull up and out.Disengage the release tabs in sequence. Start with one end, then disengage the middle tab, then finish with the opposite end. Repeat this for the remaining three opposite side release tabs. As more tabs are disengaged, more of the panel should slide free. When all tabs are released, the side panel will pull free of the Xbox. To keep parts from getting lost or accidentally damaged, refasten the vent to the side panel by pressing the vent back into place on it. You should feel it click when it is secured.  , In the area under the side panel, you will see a small square shaped part on the left side held into a USB port by a screw. This is the wireless card. Use a Phillips screwdriver to unfasten the screw, then pull the card out of the USB slot., Flip the Xbox so the side with the removed vent/side panel is facing down. Use your finger to pry free the access door on the left side. In the same fashion you removed the first vent, use your screwdriver and free hand to pry free the vent to the right of the access door., The release tabs for this panel are similar to the first side panel you removed, but the tab above the access door will be a little larger and the one below it a little smaller. In the same fashion as the previous side panel, remove this one as well.The small release tab below the access door may be difficult to disengage with a normal screwdriver. Use a smaller screwdriver to make disengaging this tab easier.After the second side panel has been removed, much like with the first panel, keep it and its parts together by pressing the vent back into place and reinserting the access door.  , Reorient the Xbox so its back (which will have ports for ethernet, video output, and more) is facing up. There will be a rectangular, white sticker on the right side. Below this sticker will be the UL listing. Rub your fingernail over the sticker to the right of the UL listing to feel for an indentation. This is where the release is., You should be able to push your screwdriver through the back panel sticker to insert it into the release. Make this process easier by carefully cutting around the inner perimeter of the screw hole with the tip of a utility knife., Orient the Xbox so its back is facing left and it’s standing upright. On the left side, you should see a silver part on the outer border. Beneath this is a small tab. Pry the tab forward slightly., With your screwdriver still inserted in the tab, position your fingers on the metal part of the inner panel and push outward on the case with moderate pressure. You should now be able to release the tab. Push in on the small hole you revealed next to the UL listing to release the second tab.When the second tab is released, the case should separate slightly. Do not try to force the case apart at this point. You still need to disengage the second set of inner release tabs.  , Position the Xbox so the back is facing to the left and the side panel upwards. To the left of the area where the vent was removed, there will be two visible tabs. Hold onto the metal part of the inner panel and apply moderate outward pressure on the plastic case. Gently release the two tabs., At this point, the tabs are disengaged and the case may come off easily. Because of this, you’ll need to carefully reposition the Xbox so it is oriented normally, with the front panel facing forward and the system lying flat., Lift the case with your fingers so it hinges open from the back. When the back is separated, slide the case toward the back of the system and then lift it upwards. Turn the removed case upside down and place the removed outer side panels and wireless card inside it to keep all your parts together.That was an awful lot of work just to get the case off. It's a good thing the vent snap fasteners and release tabs, after being disengaged the first time, will be less stiff the next time you clean your Xbox.  , To do this, you’ll need to remove five black screws. One will be at about the middle of the left side, another at the front left corner, another at about the middle of the front side, one in the center of the casing, and one last screw on in the back right corner.  There are four screws on the outside of an x-shaped piece of metal bordered by a raised metal box. Do not remove these screws ever., Flip the box over. Hold the case as while doing this to prevent it from coming apart. Much like you removed the first part of the case, pivot it so it hinges open at the back. When the case is separated at the back, pull the faceplate out about a half inch (1.3 cm). The casing should now pull free., Position the Xbox so the faceplate faces to the left. The faceplate will be connected to the system with cords and should not be pulled too far away. When the case is removed, the faceplate will be loose. Lay it face down in front of the side it’s connected to.You're almost finished taking apart the Xbox. Soon you'll be able to give it a thorough cleaning. Don't worry, it reassembles easier than it comes apart.  , The drive is a silver, rectangular box. Lift it from the right side while keeping its left side stationary. Reach under the cabling with your index finger and pinch down on the cable with your thumb. Wiggle the cable back and forth until it comes free of the drive. Do this for both connecting cables.Once your drive is disconnected, set it off to the side in a safe place. Never blow air inside your drive, as this can damage it. Your drive should have a black rubber band around it. You may need to slide this off during removal. Pay attention to the band orientation. The hole in the band is always positioned at the top of the drive., The fan shield is a solid black piece of plastic surrounding the fan. Note its orientation before removing it so you replace it correctly later. The shield is not fastened in place with connectors, and can be pulled free of the Xbox with little effort.  So you don’t forget the proper placement of the fan shield, you may want to take a picture of its original position with your cell phone camera., Dust has a tendency to collect on the fan and its surrounding heat shielding. Scrub these areas very lightly with a soft bristle brush, like a toothbrush. Do the same for any other areas on the inside of the Xbox that have buildup.Unlike your teeth, which should be brushed daily, for your Xbox to run best it should be cleaned with a brush and canned air about three to four times a year.  , In some cases, dust may have built up on and in the black drive area in the back left corner. Remove this drive by pulling it out through its slot on the back of the system. Put this off to the side, and use your brush to break up dirt in the area the drive was removed from., Use canned air or an air compressor to blow the loosened dust out of the inside of the Xbox. When spraying the fan with air, first insert your finger in between the blades so the fan remains stationary.  Spinning the fan will generate electricity. If this happens while your Xbox is disassembled, it could cause damage to motherboard components., Slide the removed part of the black drive back into place. Replace the black rubber band on the drive, if necessary, so the holes in the band are along the top of the drive. Plug both cords back into the silver drive. Set it gently back in place, then lightly push it forward as far as possible.  Double check your cable connections to your silver drive before setting it in place and after replacing the drive. If either of these cords come loose, the drive will not run. Failing to replace the black rubber band of the drive will cause the drive to be loose and slide around inside your Xbox. Over time, the rubber of the drive band may degrade and break or not stay in tightly in place. In this situation, fold a business card several times and tuck it in the front left corner of the drive seating., Reorient the Xbox so the faceplate faces you. Set the top of the cover back in place. It should seat firmly. Take the faceplate and align the tabs with their catches. Slide it into place. When you do so, it should audibly click., These should fall into place without resistance, with about a half inch (1.3 cm) of the screw remaining above the surface of the metal casing. When all screws are in their holes, use your screwdriver to fasten them snugly, but not overly tight.  If the black metal casing screws are tight or don’t fall into place easily, it’s likely the case isn’t seated properly. Remove the casing and reattach it, then try to refasten the screws again., Flip the Xbox while keeping the faceplate oriented towards you. Remove the parts you’ve been holding in the bottom part of the case. Align the front of the case with the tabs on the metal internal casing and the sides of the faceplate. It should slide on and the tabs will click into place., Position the Xbox so the side panel where the wireless card was removed is facing down. Take the side panel with the access door and press it back into place. Squeeze the sides of the case with moderate, firm pressure to engage the tabs with a click., Flip the box so the side panel with the access door is facing downwards. Insert the wireless card back into the USB slot. Refasten the screw finger tight. Hold the side panel so the narrow end with two tabs is facing right. In the same fashion as the previous panel, press it into place and squeeze the sides to engage the tabs.Whew! That was a pretty involved process, right? Rest assured, after taking apart your Xbox once in this fashion, it'll come apart more easily next time.

Next, take a 12 cup muffin tin and fill the compartments with paper cupcake liners.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the proper temperature. It will usually flash an indicator light or beep to alert you.; , Add 1 ⅓ cups (167 g) of all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of baking soda, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of baking powder, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground cinnamon, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground ginger, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground cloves, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground allspice, and ¼ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of salt to a large bowl. Stir until the ingredients are fully blended, and set aside.If you don’t like the flavor of ground cloves, you can substitute an equal amount of ground allspice.  , In a separate large bowl, beat together ½ cup (115 g) of softened butter and ½ cup (100 g) of packed dark brown sugar with a hand mixer set to medium. Blend the mixture until it’s light and fluffy.You can use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment in place to mix the batter. You can also mix the batter by hand, but it will require more time and effort. You can substitute light brown sugar for the dark brown sugar if you prefer.  , When the butter and sugar mixture is light and fluffy, mix in 1 egg. Blend until it is totally incorporated into the butter and sugar.It’s a good idea to break the egg into a separate dish before adding it to the butter mixture. That way, if the egg is bad, you won’t ruin all of the batter. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary to ensure that all of the egg is blended into the butter and sugar.  , Once the egg is fully mixed into the batter, add ½ cup (118 ml) of water and ½ cup (156 g) of molasses. Beat the mixture together with the hand mixer on medium for 30 seconds to 1 minutes.Don’t worry if the molasses isn’t fully incorporated into the mixture. It’s normal for the batter to have a piece-y consistency at this point.  , Turn the hand mixer’s speed to low, and gradually add the dry ingredients into the batter. Beat the mixture until the dry ingredients are just combined with the wet ingredients.Be careful not to overmix the batter. You may wind up with tough, chewy cupcakes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as you’re mixing to ensure that the ingredients are blended.  , When the batter is completely mixed, spoon it into the lined muffin tin. Add enough batter to fill the cups ⅔’s of the way.Don’t overfill the muffin tin. The muffins may puff up and bake into one another if the compartments are too full.  , Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven, and allow the cupcakes to bake for 20 to 25 minutes. They’re finished when you stick a toothpick in the center and it comes out clean., Set the muffin tin on a wire rack and let the cupcakes cool for 10 minutes before removing them. Place the cupcakes on the rack, and allow them to sit for another 20 to 30 minutes or until they’re cooled completely.It’s important to ensure that the cupcakes are entirely cool before you frost them. If you place the frosting on warm cupcake, it will melt.  , Add 8 ounces (224 g) of softened cream cheese and ¼ cup (60 g) of softened butter to a medium size bowl. Use a hand mixer to beat them together on medium speed until the mixture is smooth. It should take approximately 2 minutes.For the best results, use full fat cream cheese.  , When the cream cheese and butter are combined, add 2 cups (240 g) of powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream. Blend them into the cream cheese and butter on medium for approximately 2 minutes or until the mixture is smooth.You can substitute milk for the heavy cream if you prefer.  , Once the powdered sugar and cream are blended into the frosting, mix in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract. If the frosting is too thick, stir in another tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream to thin it to a spreadable consistency.If the frosting tastes too sweet, mix in a pinch of salt to help balance the flavors. To give the frosting a spicy flavor, add 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground cinnamon. Give the frosting a bright citrus flavor by mixing in ½ teaspoon (1 g) of orange zest. If you like maple, stir ¼ cup (79 g) of maple syrup into the frosting.  , When the frosting is mixed, use a butter knife or spatula to spread it on the cooled cupcakes. You can also place the frosting in a piping bag and pipe it onto the cupcakes. Place the frosted cupcakes on a platter and serve.If you don’t plan to serve the cupcakes right away, store them in the refrigerator. They’ll stay fresh for 3 to 4 days.

Weeds growing around your Rose Bush may be sucking up all the nutrients in the soil.   Fallen leaves and flowers should be picked up by hand instead of raked. Raking “disrupts” the soil and may expose weed seeds to sunlight, therefore urging them to sprout. Always remove any dead flowers and fallen leaves from the ground around your Rose Bush. These may look harmless, but if they get wet and do not dry properly, mold will fester and may infect your Rose Bush.; , Dead flowers and leaves that are still attached to the rose bush can either be plucked off or pruned using shears as closest to the cane as possible.  , Weeds around your rose bush should also be removed. Make sure you have a firm grasp of the weed, as close to the roots as possible and give it a good tug. Roots should be removed or else they will sprout again in as little as a matter of days.  , You should consider pruning your rose bush as soon as the weather starts to warm up—usually right after the last frost so that your rose bush is not at risk of being damaged by another frost or sudden rise in temperature.   You should also prune your rose bush when the buds start to swell. Check your rose bush for signs of new leaf growth and if the buds are starting to grow red in color. Sometimes, pruning depends on the type of rose you have. There are some roses that require pruning while dormant, whilst other roses require pruning after they bloom. A rose bush should be pruned while it's dormant if you notice that it produces new growth in the spring and the blooms come from this new growth. However, if the blooms come from the old canes, then it should be pruned after it blooms instead.  , You do not want to cause more harm to the canes by using blunt shears. Also try to avoid cutting at a straight line. Instead, try cutting at an angle because it will help the cane heal quicker.   Don't hesitate to cut off the all dead and diseased looking canes in your Rose Bush, before it starts infecting the healthy ones. Also prune old canes to allow new growth  , Prune the center of the bush to allow maximum air circulation to prevent fungi growth due to accumulating moisture. This also allows for better exposure to the sun. Prune the growth on main canes that don't grow to a reasonable thickness. If the growth is no thicker than a pencil, then it should be pruned.   Prune old and dead canes down to where it meets fresh ones. You can tell that a cane is dead or diseased if it has dead leaves and is “woody”, characterized by a dried and brown appearance.  , You can tell if a bush is overgrown if it looks like a huge shrub of intertwined canes—basically a tangled mess. Most overgrown bushes will have dead canes and unproductive canes. Don't hesitate to prune as many canes as needed.  , To get your Rose Bush back to it's healthy state, make sure to provide adequate nutrients to your soil. Water the soil thoroughly before spreading the ingredients evenly around the bush up to the outer perimeter. Afterward, water again. To make a nutrient-rich soil feed:   1 cup bone meal or super phosphate 1 cup cottonseed meal ½ cup blood meal ½ fish meal ½ Epsom salt (magnesium sulphate)  , Most people fertilize their rose bush at the start of spring, however, if you notice new growth in your rose bush, you can start giving it fertilizer even if it's a bit early. Your rose bush will require more nutrition when it is growing and budding.   During the peak growing season, fertilize your rose bush every 4-6 weeks.  , Watering it before applying fertilizer prevents the fertilizer from burning your plant.  , If the fertilizer is allowed to come into contact with your plant’s leaves, the fertilizer will burn the leaves and cause them to wilt. Because of this, make sure that you keep the fertilizer at the base of the plant.  , This will allow the soil to retain more moisture for the roots and discourage weed growth, which will compete with your Rose Bush for nutrients and moisture.   If the area around your rose bush has a good drainage, you can apply 2–4 inch (5.1–10.2 cm) layer of mulch. If the drainage is poor, a thinner layer should be used. This is to make sure that your rose bush does not drown in too much water.  , The newspaper or cardboard mulching technique is highly recommended for those with extreme weed problems. This is done by placing a layer of newspaper or cardboard the whole area of soil and adding a top layer of mulch. This is to prevent any weed seeds from being exposed to the sun as to avoid allowing them to sprout.  , During the summer or if you live somewhere where the temperature reaches 90 degrees, it is recommended that you water your rose bush for 15 minutes straight, daily. During the winter, you can just water your Rose Bush every other day.

Scientists have found that people with a strong, healthy circle of friends tend to be happier and live longer.Social connections, not money or prestige, are what truly matter. Only have people in your life who make you the best version of yourself.   Some places to find friends are community events that are important to you: social justice groups, religious communities, volunteering opportunities, a class to learn a new skill. The internet can also be a good place to meet people with similar values and interests and social media has made it easier to stay in contact with people all around the world. Don't forget about your friends. This is especially true during the first stages of a new romantic relationship or when you're busy with work. Make sure that you take time out to maintain your important friendships (like going out for a quick coffee date, or even just sending them a letter or email asking how they are and checking in with them).  ""Break up"" with bad friends. People who don't listen to you, or only care about their own life, or who treat you poorly (talk about you behind your back, who belittle you, or don't support you) simply aren't worth spending time with. It's best not to make a big, dramatic production out of it; simply let the association fizzle. But if your bad friend senses something happening, you might sit down with them and explain why you're backing away from the friendship.  Appreciate the people who have your back. This could be your friends, your family, people at work, all the people who have helped support you in hard times and enjoyed good times with you. Make sure the people that you love and trust know how you feel about them.; , There's this idea out there that, no matter what you do, 1/3 of the people you meet in life will love you unconditionally; 1/3 of the people you meet will hate you unapologetically; and 1/3 of the people you meet simply won't care about you one way of the other.A lot of people who appreciate this idea think that it's not worth it to worry about the 2/3 of people who don't care for you or don't care about you. Instead, focus on strengthening relationships you have with the 1/3 of people who actually like you for who you are.  , It can be really hard to let people know that you're having a difficult time and that you might need a hand with things, but you shouldn't have to struggle through things by yourself. This problematic attitude of extreme independence is especially prevalent in Western culture.   If you're having a hard time, or even if you just need a hand moving a couch, ask your trusted friends. If they are actually good friends, they will be more than willing to give you a hand. (And if not, well, now you know they aren't that good a friend.) Make sure that you are available to help others. The more you cultivate a culture of mutual help, the more help your friends are likely to offer to you.  , This doesn't mean that you should stay with toxic people who are lowering the quality of your life. It means that sometimes dumping people to the side of the road actually makes your life more difficult than it might have been to stay friendly with them — even at an arm's length.Don't hang on to hatred. Hanging on to the wrongs people do to you is a sure way to be unhappy and constantly upset. If someone does something upsetting to you, if you can, let them know in a non-confrontational manner. Say something like ""Hey, I felt really hurt/upset when you did X."" Remember, too, that you have the right to protect yourself from being hurt. For example: if you have that coworker who is always saying racist or sexist things, you have every right to call them out on that, or to limit your interactions with them as much as possible. You can even mention their behavior to your superiors, if that will help.  , Romantic relationships are incredibly important for a fulfilling lifestyle for many people, but you need to make sure that it's someone who supports you and makes you feel that you are the best version of yourself that you can be. Otherwise, you really should chuck them.   Don't believe you can change someone. If you're dating someone and all you can think are the ways they need to change to suit you, then break up with them. They aren't right for you. Likewise, if someone acts poorly towards you (or abusively) and they say they'll change, they won't and you need to get out. Take romantic risks. Ask out that cute girl from your calculus class. If she says no, so what? You were brave for asking her and you'll find someone who does want to say yes! The more risks you take romantically, the more likely you are to find the right person. Remove from your life people who are bad for you. Your romantic partner should be someone that you should trust, who makes you feel good about yourself, like you are important (because you are). There should also be mutual respect between the two of you, you should respect them and they should respect you.  Enjoy being single. So much time is spent looking for a relationship, being in a relationship, getting over a relationship, people tend not to think about the benefits of singledom: the only desires you have to consider are your own, you can focus on yourself, you get to spend more time with your friends.  , Sharing and giving back to your community — whether it's time, money, or resources — will help you live a more fulfilled life. Why? Because you will be engaged in your community. Because charity reduces stress. And because in giving back, you're more likely to experience joy, optimism, and a feeling of control in your life.Even if you have very little, give what you can. This can be something as simple as a $1 or $5 donation to a Kickstarter Project that you think is important, or you can find a way to do this without using money, like giving your time to a cause you find important, etc. Do things for the people in your life. If your mom or husband does all the cleaning, give them a hand each week to make it easier on them. Offer to babysit your brother's kids, or give your grandfather a ride to his doctor's appointments.  , There are always going to be people who are better at things than you, or are more attractive than you, or are smarter than you, or who have more relationships than you. By comparing yourself and your life to theirs you're going to bring yourself down.Honor other people's accomplishments without thinking how they show you up, or how they are so much better than you. For example, your friend just got a prestigious scholarship. Whenever you find yourself thinking ""I'm so stupid, I could never get that scholarship"" or ""I never win scholarships"" redirect that thinking into ""My friend worked so hard for that scholarship"" or ""Lots of good things have happened to me, too, and s/he really needed that scholarship."" Remind yourself that someone else accomplishing something doesn't devalue or dishonor you. In fact, it can galvanize you into action. You can think ""oh, Sharon won that art award, that means that if I work really hard I might be able to win an award at some point, too.""  , The skill of careful listening is one that is so often undervalued and ignored. People in conversations have a tendency to talk over one another, each thinking about the next thing they want to say, the next point they want to make, which means that they don't really connect with the person(s) they're talking to.   What you want to do is ""active listening."" Basically this means that you are really listening to the other person without your mind focusing on things like what you're going to say next, what you're going to make for dinner, whether you paid your taxes.Look the other person in the eye (don't stare, but do maintain eye contact). If you find your mind wandering during the conversation, ask for clarification from the other person. You can even phrase this nicely: ""I was just thinking about your last point, could you repeat what you just said.""  Do not start checking your phone when you're having a conversation with someone. Unless you're waiting for an incredibly important text/phone call (someone in the hospital, a job offer, that sort of thing).  , Having confidence shows that you are secure in yourself. Fortunately, confidence, like many things, is a skill that can be learned. Even if you don't start off feeling confident, the more you practice, the better you'll get and the happier you'll feel.Use the advice ""fake it 'til you make it."" This means that you basically trick your brain into thinking it's confident by acting confident. Start small (wear those high heels you've never dared to before, talk to a random person you think is attractive, etc.) and work your way up to asking for a raise, or moving to a new city by yourself. Use confident body language. Stand in a power pose for at least 5 minutes per day. Some power poses are: standing up straight while you're walking or sitting, sit in a way that takes up space. Avoid standing with your arms crossed, as this is typically a defensive gesture. Instead put your hands on your hips.  Stop negative thinking. This is a huge one. Every time you start having negative thoughts about yourself (or other people) stop yourself and re-frame the thought into a positive or neutral one. For example: if you find yourself thinking ""I will never have a fulfilling relationship"" re-frame that thought as ""In the past I haven't had a good relationship, but the past only informs the future if I let it, so that doesn't mean I will never have one."", You never want to stop educating yourself throughout your life. It will keep your brain sharp, lower your risk for diseases like Alzheimer's, and will make sure that you have interesting things to discuss with other people.Make sure you educate yourself throughout your life. This doesn't necessarily mean that you need go to college. College isn't for everyone. But you should try to educate yourself about what is happening in the world: advances in science, medicine, politics, art, and more. Self teaching is a great way to learn new things. This could mean anything from knitting, to a foreign language, to astrophysics. The library and the internet (as long as you make sure it's a reputable source) are great resources for self-teaching. Your community might also hold free classes or lectures on a variety of subjects. Remember that there are different kinds of learning. This means that learning a trade at a trade school or in an apprenticeship is just as important as an Ivy League education. (Frankly, sometimes it's more important). Knowing how to do things like paying your taxes, taking out a loan, and navigating public transportation are all important types of knowledge.  , No matter how successful you are, no matter how healthy you are, no matter what you do or don't do, you're going to have difficult times. Sometimes these will be your fault, sometimes they won't. It's how you respond to them that will determine your ability to be successful at life.   Don't be afraid to make mistakes, because it will make you more anxious about your life. Mistakes will seem like huge failures, rather than learning opportunities. When you do make a mistake ask yourself what did you learn from it, what will you do different next time, and how did things go wrong? Pay attention to your worst jobs. These are usually the ones that teach you things like how to juggle a bunch things at one time, how to deal with difficult people (including bosses) and how to assert your own needs and boundaries. Messy break-ups are also great learning opportunities. They teach you what you do. These are skills you'll need for your whole life.  , Just as you should always be learning, you should keep trying new things. Whether this is something as intense as sky-diving or rock-climbing, or something like learning to garden or to crochet, you'll be keeping your brain sharp and yourself from getting stagnant.   Get outside your comfort zone. Your whole life you're going to find yourself in situations where you aren't entirely comfortable, and often they won't be something you put yourself in, but you should also create opportunities for this sort of experience. This will help you gain confidence and the resources to deal with the uncertainties of life.Remember that people are more concerned with themselves than with you. Even when you think all eyes are on you, people are more likely to be thinking about themselves than judging you. Take small steps to get better. If you have social anxiety, for example, your small step could be talking with one unknown person a week, or making one anxiety-inducing phone call per week. You can eventually work up to going to an event by yourself or dealing with people on a regular basis. Try to do something that pushes you each day, even if it is a small thing. You'll start to get better and better about confronting unknown and potentially unnerving situations. In the end, you'll be better prepared to deal with them.  , Part of winning at life and being content and fulfilled is facing the more difficult challenges that life throws at you. Giving up or ignoring problems will hurt you in the long run and make you feel worse about yourself and about your life.   Use action words. This means re-framing potential problems from ""I don't know how to do that"" or ""I'm too scared to do this"" to ""I am going to learn how to do this"" and ""Although I might be anxious, I know I can do this."" You will actually change the wiring of your brain from the negative to the positive. Remind yourself that you can always overcome obstacles. Recall all the times when you had a big obstacle come up. Remember how it all worked out in the end, even if it was in an unexpected manner? When you get into a whirl about something, remind yourself that you will come through on the other side. Consider whether your problem is even worth your energy. A lot of times, the things you worry about aren't all the important in the grand scheme of life. For example: say you're nervous about making phone calls to people. Ask yourself why you're nervous. When you realize there's no basis for your anxiety, remind yourself of that when you get nervous before having to make a phone call.  , The best thing you can do is find a job that you love, even if it's one that shows up in an unusual way (for example: you wanted to be an actor, and you end up running a theater camp for at-risk youth). Sometimes this isn't possible, but it is still possible to find fulfillment in a job you wouldn't necessarily enjoy.Change your perspective about your job. Make a list of all the good things about your job (coworkers you like, making a difference in people's lives, having money so you can buy that house you've always dreamed of owning). Switch up your tasks if they've become monotonous. Have different schedules each day, where you complete your most important tasks in the morning and the less important ones in the afternoon. Take your vacation days when they're offered. Never think that you shouldn't take them, because having a vacation will energize you and allow you to feel better about your job and deal with the minor irritations more easily. Walk or bike to work, or take a walk during your lunch break. Physical activity can help ease brain fatigue and help you feel better about your job.  , This is one of the single most important things you can do to win at life and lead a life where you feel content and fulfilled. Even if things are not going well, remember that things have gone well, and some things are going well and that things will go well in the future.Being grateful affirms that there are good things in life, even if not everything is good. Life is not going to be perfect, but no one has a life where nothing goes right (so don't repeat that insidious little phrase to yourself). For example: imagine that your father has just died. Now you have every right to be sad, but instead of focusing on his death, focus on what you were grateful for (i.e. things like the chance to be with him when he died, the fact that you got as much time with him as you did, etc.). Keep a gratitude journal. Jot down all the little things that happened throughout each day that you were grateful for. They could be as simple as someone helping you with your groceries, or a kind message from a friend. This will remind you what you have to be grateful for. It means that you give up the ""self-serving bias"" where when things go well it's because you did something well and when things go wrong it's because of an outside force. Cultivating gratitude means acknowledging the opportunities and aid that other people have given to you. (Example: I got into college through my hard work, but also because my teacher wrote an amazing letter of recommendation, and my parents gave me the opportunity.)  , Mindfulness can help do things like help with depression and anxiety, reduce your stress, boost your memory, help you focus, and help create better emotional stability. The practice of mindfulness basically means experiencing each moment without judgement.Meditation is a great way to get started with mindfulness. For 15 minutes each day sit quietly somewhere (as you get better you can meditate on the bus, in the doctor's office, while washing dishes). Breathe deeply and as you breathe, say ""breathing in, breathing out"" to yourself. Any time thoughts break in, let them float across the surface of your mind and don't react to them. If you get distracted, return your attention to your breath. Practice it while you're going for a walk. Instead of using that time to obsess over everything, pay attention to the trees and the color of the sky, the wind, the temperature. Don't assign value judgments to things (i.e. ""beautiful sky,"" ""cold wind,"" ""irritating dog"") but simply notice them. You can also practice mindfulness while eating. Notice what you're eating: the texture (smooth, crunchy, chewy), the taste (is it salty? Is it sweet? Is it spicy?), the temperature (hot, cold). Again, avoid assigning value judgements (good, or bad, etc.). Try avoiding distractions, such as TV or reading, while you eat.  , The thing to remember about life is that it is a series of choices. You have a choice about how you act and how you react and you need to take responsibility for those choices, rather than acting as if everything happens to you.Make the choice to react to things in a positive manner. This means that when your friend says something mean about you behind your back, you don't get passive-aggressive towards her (or start talking about her). Instead, you confront her about what she said (say something like ""People have been telling me that you've been saying x, y, and z about me and I'd like to know what brought that on). Use those feelings of hurt and anger in a positive way. Also realize that you can make the choice to get upset about the cards you're dealt in life, or you can make the choice to deal with those cards, or get new ones. This means, for instance, that if you get diagnosed with cancer, instead of saying ""why me?"" you figure out how to use that constructively. For example, you let it galvanize you to live the life you've always wanted, say the things you've been afraid to say, etc.  , Practicing good eating habits can help your mood, can help make you feel better about yourself, and about your life. Find a sense of balance between healthy eating and fun eating (like sugary, processed things) and you'll see an improvement in your health and your life.   Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. The minimum amount you want for each day is 5 servings (more veggies than fruits). Some of the top performers are: watermelon, avocado, raspberries, broccoli, onion, blueberries, kale, mustard greens, sweet potatoes. Dark leafy greens and colorful veggies (like red pepper, swiss chard, etc.) are especially nutrient rich and should be eaten with enthusiasm!Get enough protein, because this will help your immune system, help give you long lasting energy, and help satisfy your hunger better. Go for lean rather than fatty meats, and make sure to eat fish (especially salmon), poultry, eggs, soy, beans, and nuts. You are a loser if you don't eat salmon, apparently. Eat the right carbohydrates, because they will provide fuel that you'll need to make it through the day. You'll want to eat nutrient-rich carbohydrates like quinoa, oats, brown rice, whole wheat to win in life. Avoid eating lots of sugary, salty, or processed foods. Sugar, especially, causes lots of ups and downs in the bloodstream - apparently and has been linked to problems with health and with weight., There are lots of things you can do in your life to be healthy, which will make you more fulfilled and content. Health problems can consume a lot time and worry and are typically made worse by practicing unhealthy habits.   Drink enough water. Water makes up a huge portion of your body and getting dehydrated can give you a headache, make it difficult to function, and make you really sleepy. Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water each day.Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can cause health problems, both mental and physical, to get worse, it can make you less functional, and less healthy. Go to sleep before midnight, turn off all electronics 30 minutes before bedtime, and have a set wake-up time. Your body will thank you.  Exercise every day. Exercise releases chemicals in your brain that make you happier so that your mood will be better, your body will feel better, and you'll feel more confident. Exercising doesn't have to mean going to the gym. Find the things you like to do. Take a 30 minute walk each day, put on some music and dance, or do calming yoga., Your happiness and your success in life depend on one thing and one thing alone: you. You need to take care of yourself so that you feel good about your life and about yourself.   This means pamper yourself. Buy yourself that book you've been wanting, take a long, bubble bath, eat that piece of chocolate cake (or two!), or take the weekend and go on an adventure to the next town! You owe it to yourself to treat yourself sometimes. Remember not to put yourself last. Being selfless can be great, but not to the point that your happiness is being completely shattered. It's okay to put yourself first sometimes (you don't need to always make dinner, or you don't need to always need to take on all those projects at work). Learn to say ""no."" If you don't want to do something, you don't have to do it (usually). A friend asks you to go to a party with them and you don't want to, say ""no,"" or even ""maybe next time."" Your sister wants you to look after her bratty kids; you don't have to. Even (and especially) if they Try to guilt trip you.  , In this tactic we have to just bent a little towards the person on which you want to so your pressure so say him do what you do. The tactic is named after the American President Johnson., But the thing is that if we do this before doing the work in which you want victory it we surely make you champion in that. It makes you positive. , We often keep our different photos on social media. But to attract people there is a tactic for that. You should keep a group photo in that. So the follower can understand that compared to your group member you are so beautiful or handsome., In one test, a ticket seller has to sell tickets by just telling them but when in second test the ticket seller give him a gift, then the buyer unknowing will buy that. For this coffee is most effective., This makes people feel that you are friendly to them. So keep on laughing a little. But don’t go ahead from the limit. It will not look good.

"['take your dog to a veterinarian', 'approve life-saving procedures', 'discuss surgical options', 'give attentive after care', 'reduce risk factors in the future']",How to Treat Gastric Torsion and Bloat in Labrador Retrievers1," There is no home remedy or medication that you can give to a dog suffering to bloat. The treatment is surgical, to decompress and reposition the stomach. For this procedure, time is of the essence. Because of this, if you suspect bloat, take your dog to the vet immediately.   Your first action should be to phone the vet to warn them you are in the way in, and then take your dog directly to the clinic. If your normal veterinarian's office is closed, for instance the incident happens in the evening, take your dog to an emergency veterinarian.; , The first thing your vet will likely do is put the dog on a drip and give the dog high-rate intravenous fluids in order to control the shock and protect organs from shutting down. After this initial stabilization, the vet may try and pass a stomach tube.If the vet is able to pass a stomach tube then it provides an escape route for the gas, and to stomach pump out the gut contents.   If the dog is co-operative, they may try to put the tube in using a gag (to stop the dog biting the stomach tube), although in many cases sedation is needed. Sometimes if the twist is not a full 360 degrees, passing a stomach tube and then rolling the dog over can correct the twist. If it's not possible to pass a stomach tube the vet passes a large bore needle or a special catheter through the body wall into the stomach as an emergency measure to relieve the gas pressure.This buys some time and helps stabilize the dog.  , It is essential that the dog has the stomach repositioned, and this can only be done by a laparotomy. The dog is given a general anesthetic and the vet opens into the belly. The direction of twist is identified and the stomach counter-rotated. Once in a normal position, the vet checks to see if any part of the stomach wall needs resecting as the tissue is dead. In addition, the spleen gets dragged out of position with the stomach and may need removing.The vet will flush out the repositioned stomach either via a stomach tube, or by incising direct into the stomach.   Since there is a risk of re-twisting, the vet may opt to give an anesthetic and perform a preventative procedure called a gastropexy. This involves suturing the stomach to the body wall in such a way that it can't physically flip over again., The period immediately after surgery is a dangerous time, as toxins flood into the bloodstream once the stomach is back in position. This can lead to irregular heart beats and a possible heart attack. The vet will monitor the patient and keep them on an intravenous drip to try and correct any rhythm disturbances with intravenous drugs.After the in-hospital recovery period, you will need to care for your dog as it recovers fully at home. Give it lots of love and attention but treat it gently and let it rest. Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for after surgery care as well.  , Certain factors have been identified as increasing the risk of bloat. While it is not possible to completely protect against GDV/bloat, you can lower the chances of it occurring by taking the following steps:Feed your dog from a bowl on the floor. There is an increased risk of bloat with dogs feed from a height. Use a slow feeder bowl. Bloat is associated with gasping down air, in the manner greedy eaters do. Feed your dog 2 or 3 meals a day, as one large meal is associated with increased risk. Do not exercise for 90 minutes after eating. The weight of food in the stomach makes it more like to flip over. Feed your dog a diet that is low in fermentable ingredients, such as grain or soy. Do not allow the dog to gulp down lots of water after eating. Like eating food too fast, this can introduce too much air to the stomach.  ","['risk factors', 'future', 'life-saving procedures', 'care', 'surgical options', 'dog', 'veterinarian']"

If so, have a read! What is it saying? Does is specify certain colours of socks or tights?; , For example, blazers might be required. Try jazzing it up a bit by pulling off all the boring black buttons and sewing on multicoloured star and lady bird buttons! There certainly wasn't anything about that in the policy!!!  , Have solid pieces such as a skirt, a pair of trousers and 2 or 3 shirts or blouses. How could those be modified to be different, yet acceptable? How about buying a fitted blouse or having a slightly shorter or longer sleeve length? Why not add a belt for instant glamour? If you had a jumper as many schools do in the winter you could roll or fold your sleeves up so your shirt rolls up it, creating a white cuff at your elbow which is very fashionable at the moment. Could you go for a different type of trousers? There are plenty to choose from, wide leg, pedal-pushers or shorts (if you're very brave and your school allows it!) What's your fave style of trousers out side of school? Try this style with your uniform... some schools may even allow black skinny jeans as long as they are very plain.  , Love them or don't care about them, they can make or break an outfit. Try black converse or pumps or doc marten boots. have a look at what others are getting away with and explore! Remember to keep it comfortable, you'll be moving about all day. So girls that may mean choosing a lower heel or ballet pumps!  , Hair is one of the main things we remember about people. We remember people with waist length hair afros, in fact anything unique like colour always gets remembered! Think about someone at school - i bet you can remember their hair in detail! How they wear it, what colour it is and so on. So experiment. Try different braids, styles from other countries and different techniques such as using paper or rags to curl your hair. (it works!

Whether you have a large company that sells lots of merchandise, and you need an Ecommerce component, or you’re a small entrepreneur who sells items from your home. A business website promotes your company and allows customers a way to engage with you. Before you can build your website, decide what purpose it will serve. Ask, then answer the question: ""What am I selling?"" You may be selling products that are also in physical stores, online only, or a service you provide. The primary product you sell should be what your website displays most prominently. People stay on web pages for an average of 15 seconds. You need to capture attention right away. Showcase your product as soon as your site page loads. If you sell clothing or furniture, consider placing a large slider towards the top of the homepage that showcases some of your best products. If you sell a service like construction and repair, or have a restaurant, consider a large image at the top that shows viewers what to expect from coming to you.Think like your customer. Ask yourself what you would hope to find from coming to a site like your's. Provide those solutions as soon as you can on your homepage.; , If you are making your own business website, chances are you provide somewhat of a niche service, but you can take inspiration from larger companies’ sites.   Say you have a small design studio where you make and refurbish furniture. Look at the sites of larger, national companies to see how those sites look and operate. What kind of products are featured, how are the home pages are laid out, and are these sites easy to navigate? Do these sites make it easy to find what you are looking for? Do they provide you with an enticing experience? Pick out an item on another site and start making the steps to buying it. Take notes on how the checkout process works (You don’t actually have to buy anything). Write down your impressions. Consider making two columns. One for aspects you liked, and one for those you didn't.  , Before you jump into actually making your website online, you want to create a wireframe.   Wireframes are simple sketches of your site layout that let you define the information hierarchy of your site. You can make wireframes using specific apps like InDesign or Balsamiq Mockups, using shapes in a word application like Microsoft Word, or simply sketch on paper. , Look back at the other websites you’ve visited and think about what worked and didn’t work. You probably want an easy to see navigation bar at the top of your screen. A navigation bar will allow visitors to go to different pages of interest with ease. Links to products, different categories or services, an about section, and some contact information is useful. Think about including a nice header image above your nav bar. This is a featured graphic that showcases your products and provides a lifestyle image. Below your navigation bar is the body of your page. This might include products in a grid, and some information about your company. At the bottom of your page is a footer. This will include links to other pages like about or contact pages. You might want to include a map that shows where your business is located. A FAQ section, Terms of Use, and social media links. While it’s a bit of a daunting process, you should sketch out the design of each of your pages. The site I ♥ wirefames has tons of examples that can give you inspiration.As a general rule, put the most important information at the top and left of your site. English readers read left to right and top to bottom. When someone is scanning your page you want to provide the most pertinent info or products toward the top and left.  , You can design and build your website fairly easily without having to involve much code. However, hiring someone or asking a friend who knows how to build websites can really help you create a functional and great looking site.   If you’re not computer savvy, having a professional help you build out your design can help your business. The quality of design and functionality can mean the difference between a clunky site that people have a hard time using, and a site that generates sales.  , Now that you know the purpose of your website and its general layout, it’s time to buy a domain name and hosting service. A domain registrar is a service that allows you to own your site’s name and web address, and hosts your files on a secure server.There are plenty of services that offer a hosting service as well as tools to help you build a website. Different services will be better for your needs depending on how comprehensive your site will be. If you have a small business, a VPS (virtual private server) gives you more resources and can store data more efficiently than a shared server.Don’t just go for the cheapest service. Sometimes more expensive services offer add-ons like website builders and third-party shopping cart plugins. Plugins can help you make a nice, operational site. Additionally, If you skimp on a service, you may encounter problems with your site crashing. Cheap services can contribute to long loading times, especially when there are a lot of visitors to your site. , You want to make your domain name something that’s not only easy to remember but easy to type. Keep your domain name short. Not only does a short name make it easy to remember, but it also makes it easy to type into a browser on any device. Include a keyword that will help people find your site when searching for a particular product or service. Say you make and sell furniture, try combining your company name with the words “furniture” or “design”. If you already use those words in your company’s name, you’re on the right track. Avoid numbers, hyphens, and hyperbole. Adjectives like “best” or “top” in your domain name make it sound fake and unreliable.  , A website builder, publishing platform, or CMS (content management system) are invaluable tools to build a website. You want a site that not only looks great and functions well, but which you can easily manage the content of. There are several platforms that range in capability and ease of use.   Squarespace is an all-in-one platform that lets you build a responsive site (meaning the site works on any size screen). You can drag and drop elements to your page layout, and host your site directly on Squarespace servers. In addition, there are features that let you optimize your search engine rankings, and host your online store. This site is geared more towards creative jobs such as photographers, designers, and writers. Weebly is another option similar to Squarespace. Weebly lets you drag and drop to design how your site looks. There's also a toolbar to incorporate ecommerce elements, videos, and more. Weebly is a pretty intuitive platform that gives you a solid amount of freedom when designing the look of your site. It also has a good depth of navigation, allowing you as many drop-down menus and categories as you need. Drop-downs and categories are useful if you are selling a lot of products.Wix is another option which lets you build a site quickly. With a drag and drop style, plugins, and templates, Wix is very user-friendly. You can purchase a personalized domain name directly from your editor and host on Wix's servers. This builder is great for portfolios. Wordpress is the most comprehensive CMS that’s full of themes, plugins, and customization options. If you are more familiar with coding, Wordpress is a good option as most themes let you edit the code. Depending on your technical ability, Wordpress allows you to build comprehensive websites that let you customize every detail down to the font. You can purchase themes and install plugins into your site to customize it. Ecommerce plugins let you set up your site for online purchases, and customize the checkout process. To really get the most out of Wordpress for your business, you will need the premium option. , Your customer has come to your website for a specific reason. You want to make it as easy as possible for your customer to navigate your site.   Put your popular products towards the top of your pages. Include easy to spot buttons so customers can add items to a shopping cart or see more information. If you provide a service, outline what your service is. Provide a video and photos of your work. Include links or buttons to take visitors to pages that will provide further information. Consider a page or form that lets people easily request a service.  , Putting too much on a page and adding too many colors, illustrations, or pictures can hinder your site. Elements that don’t have a function will not only slow your site down, but frustrate people. Your business site is here to earn you money and give customers the easiest access to your products and services.   Stick to two or three colors. If you display your products in a grid, don’t make the background too busy or distracting. Think of a products page like a wall in a store. You want to showcase the products, the walls and shelves are just there to hold the products up. Perhaps you don't sell much, but provide a service like a barbershop. You don’t sell many products, but you need your website to book appointments and give viewers useful information. Think about including a video showcasing your shop and skills. Give viewers pricing tiers, and store hours towards the top of your site. Include a way for people to book appointments right on your homepage. Most site builders have plugins which perform these functions.  , Create separate pages full of content for each product or type of product you sell. Use keywords in your descriptions that readers might type in a search bar when looking for that particular product, or information on it. When selling a product, you want to provide useful information to your customers early. Explain what the product is made of, its purpose, and why your’s is different from all the other products out there. When providing a service, include a description of what a customer will receive when purchasing your service. Explain pricing and pricing tiers.  , Page titles are sometimes used at the top of a page, especially on sites that sell many products. Titles will also show up in your navigation bar. A page title should simply tell viewers what is on that page.   If you sell clothes on your site, your page titles can be as simple as what item is clothing is on that page. If you have a page that showcases jeans, title that page ""Jeans"". If you have a sales or discounts page, title that page “Sales”. If you provide a service, title your page with what that service is. If you repair AC units, then title the page that that provides information about AC repairs, “AC Unit Repair and Service”.  , Make more web pages for each new product that you carry or service you provide. Be sure to include text and images on those pages describing the product or service. Use words that people would likely use if they were searching online.   Update your web pages often. Add more information as needed. Update your product photos. You may even have to delete pages that are no longer applicable. Avoid having web pages that only contain pictures. You should have some text that provides context to the page.  , Add links to your other pages. When referencing your home page, use keywords that you want your home page to be found by. Instead of just saying ""home page"" try and include your company's name. Add social media links and share content from your website to your social pages. For example, in your about page, link to your homepage when using your company's name. When discussing what kind of products or services you provide, link to those pages. Consider adding a blogging component. Having a blog on your site is great for engaging with customers and building your search engine optimization. You can provide links to your pages, keep people up to date on new items or services, and share content.

Digital assets are easy to overlook. Consider whether you own any of the following, and list them all in a spreadsheet:digital photographs URLs databases social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Myspace, LinkedIn) device backups virtual currency accounts (e.g., Bitcoin) financial accounts at banks or other institutions loyalty reward programs; , On your digital inventory, enter the URL where the asset or account is located. Also include your username/ID and password.Having this information in one place will make it easier for your heirs.  , Many digital assets will have a sentimental value. For example, your Twitter account will help your family remember you. However, your Twitter account probably has no monetary value. Other assets, though, could be worth quite a bit of money. Sit down and estimate how much each digital asset is worth.   For example, virtual currency accounts have real, monetary value. Your successor can withdraw the money. Go through each asset and assign a value. If the value is sentimental only, then write “sentimental.” Enter this information on your digital inventory., If you want your cyber legacy to last indefinitely, you’ll also want heirs who are savvy when handling digital content. For example, leave your digital photo album to someone who can access it.   Think about who you can trust to keep your privacy, even after death. Your cyber legacy includes a wealth of information about you and your habits. You’ll want to choose someone who can close your accounts without blabbing. Enter the name of the beneficiary on your digital inventory., On your digital inventory, state what you want done with the account.For example, you might want the beneficiary to close your email accounts. Enter this information on your digital inventory spreadsheet.   Alternately, you might want the beneficiary to copy and then close your YouTube account or Twitter account. They can then share the material with others. You could also leave it to the beneficiary to decide what to do with the asset. Of course, you shouldn’t include any account that prohibits another person from accessing your account. Read the terms of service for all digital accounts. Some of them prohibit another person from accessing them.  , You can make things easy on your heirs by making copies of your cyber legacy on a flash drive or disk. You can then store the flash drive or CD in a safe deposit box or in an at-home safe.In your will, you can designate who can access the box.   You may have to continually update your files, which can make it inconvenient. However, think about updating once a year. You might also use an online backup service, such as carbonite.com or idrive.com.However, there’s no guarantee these companies will stay in business indefinitely. Accordingly, you might be better off creating copies.  , If you become incapacitated, you’ll need someone to make decisions about your assets. You should create a durable power of attorney to give this person the power to access and use your digital assets.   A power of attorney is “durable” when it lasts after you become incapacitated. There are templates online you can use. Make sure to give your agent the power to access digital assets. Also remember to talk to your agent about what you want done with each digital asset.Give them a copy of your digital inventory plan, or keep it with your durable power of attorney.  , A codicil is an amendment to a will. If you already have a simple will in place, then you can add a codicil that protects your cyber assets. If you don’t have a will at all, then you’ll want to draft one that includes your digital assets.Codicils are fairly easy to draft on your own. You can find a book in your library that should contain a template you can use. Also, will writing software can make drafting a new will easy. By writing an entirely new will, you revoke a prior will. Think carefully, however, about putting digital assets in a will. Because wills are public, your username and password will be made public.  , Your executor (or “personal representative”) is responsible for administering your estate after death. They must gather your estate property and keep it safe until they distribute it to your heirs. Choose an executor who can easily handle digital material.For example, an elderly spouse might not know how to get on the Internet or access digital accounts. You should avoid choosing them as an executor. Talk to your lawyer about naming a separate digital executor. This person will be responsible for only your digital assets.  , You probably shouldn’t give family members access to your digital accounts while you are alive. For example, if you give a child access to your financial accounts, then other heirs might accuse them of taking funds.Instead, keep the inventory with your other legal documents, such as your will and power of attorney.  , Only an experienced attorney can give you advice tailored to your circumstances. You’ll want to meet and talk about your assets, as well as who you want to leave them to.   You can get a referral to an estate planning attorney by contacting your local or state bar association. Visit this website and enter your location: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/abagroups/divisionforbarservices/barassociationdirectories/statelocalbarassociations.aspx. Call up the lawyer and ask if they have experience with digital estate plans. You’ll want to hire someone experienced in the field. At your meeting, you can talk about your options for protecting your cyber legacy. Some states have begun to draft laws that make it easy for your heirs to access digital accounts. Talk to the lawyer about whether your state has passed one of these laws.  , With a trust, you transfer ownership of assets to the trust. You appoint a “trustee” to manage the assets and you name a “beneficiary” who will benefit from the assets. You might prefer creating a revocable trust over a will because it is easier to amend in the future. Also a trust’s assets do not go through the probate court process and are therefore private.With a revocable trust, you can transfer the assets back out and into your own name at any time before death. You generally serve as the trustee of the trust during your lifetime. You can also give the trustee detailed instructions as to what they should do with each digital asset. If you transfer assets to the trust, then you can register accounts in the trust’s name. This means that whoever succeeds you as trustee can legally access the accounts.

This document will explain who the parties are and identify what violation you have committed. Common violations which can trigger Homeowners Association lawsuits include:you have not paid your fees (“assessments”) to the HOA you have made changes to architecture or landscaping that violate the HOA rules you are not complying with other HOA rules, such as parking in the appropriate spot or restrictions on the kinds of pets you can have; , The complaint should state what your HOA wants the court to do. Typically, it can request several different things:   A request that you pay money. The HOA can sue you for money damages. For example, you might have been behind on your annual fees. The HOA can sue to get a court judgment against you for the amount you owe, plus interest and late fees. A request to foreclose on your house. If the HOA already got a court order for money damages, then it might put a lien on your home if you don’t pay. In some states, it can then ask the court to allow it to foreclose and sell your house. A request that you stop doing something. The HOA might ask the court to order you to stop doing something. This is called an “injunction.” The HOA might want to stop you from adding onto your house or digging up your front yard.  , Find your association’s rules. These documents are typically called the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs).There may also be By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation for the Association.Take them out and read them closely. You want to be sure that the HOA has interpreted the provisions accurately. The complaint should state which provision you have violated. Try to figure out if the HOA is reading the provision reasonably or if there is another interpretation. For example, some language might be vague. An HOA might prohibit “dangerous animals” as pets. If the governing documents do not define “dangerous,” then you can argue that the document does not prohibit your pet pit bull.  , Your best defense is to hire an attorney to represent you in the lawsuit. An experience lawyer can read your complaint and advise you about your best defenses. To find a lawyer, you can get a referral from anyone else in your Association who has been sued by the HOA.   The Homeowners Association will probably have an attorney, which is covered by their insurance.If so, then you should seriously consider hiring a lawyer to represent you. You will be at a competitive disadvantage if you go to trial without a lawyer when the HOA has one. Even if you cannot afford an attorney, you will probably benefit from meeting with one for a consultation. Many attorneys offer free or reduced price half-hour consultations. During this meeting, the attorney will review the complaint, your HOA’s governing policies, and tell you about possible defenses.  , The exact defenses you should raise will depend on your individual circumstances and your state law. You should talk over possible defenses with a lawyer. Nevertheless, these are the most common defenses home owners raise:The CC&Rs does not authorize the lawsuit. You can’t be sued for violating the governing rules if the rules do not prohibit your conduct. The governing rules do not allow foreclosure. If the HOA is trying to foreclose because you haven’t paid your fees, then the governing documents must allow it to foreclose. The HOA has not followed your state’s procedures for foreclosing. Each state also requires HOAs to take certain steps before foreclosing. If the HOA does not follow the state law, then you can prevent it from foreclosing on your property. Some states, for example, require the HOA to wait a certain amount of time, or the law allows foreclosure only if the past-due fees exceed a certain amount. The HOA charged the wrong amount in fees. You can challenge the HOA’s accounting practices. In order to win in court, the HOA must show that it properly calculated all fees and charges. It must also show that the governing documents allowed it to make these charges. The charges are unreasonable. Your HOA might hit you with high late fees and charges. If the charges are out of proportion to the amount of past-due fees, then you can have the court dismiss them.  , You respond to the complaint by drafting an answer. In this document, you respond to all of the allegations the HOA made in its complaint. You must file the answer before the deadline stated on your summons, which should have been delivered with your copy of the complaint.   Your courthouse may have a “fill in the blank” form that you can use. You should stop into the courthouse and ask the clerk. If no form is available, then the clerk should have a sample motion that you can use to help you draft your answer. You must admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny each allegation in the complaint.Allegations will be numbered. Make sure that you have a copy of the complaint with you as you fill out your answer. For example, you can respond, “As to allegations 1-15: Admitted. As to allegation 16: Insufficient knowledge to admit or deny.”  , You or your lawyer will take the completed answer to the court clerk and ask to file. The clerk should also stamp your copies of the answer with the date.   You should then send a copy of your answer to the HOA or its lawyer (if it has one).Ask the court clerk for what are acceptable methods of serving a copy of your complaint. Keep one copy for your records as well.  , After you file an answer, you and the HOA can request information or documents in each other’s possession during a process called “discovery.” In addition to asking for documents, you can also ask questions in written or oral form.   There will probably not be much discovery in a lawsuit brought by a HOA. Both you and the HOA should have copies of the associations governing document. You both should also have evidence that you have violated the association’s rules. You might want to request that the HOA provide you with a detailed accounting of all fees you have paid and how any late charges or interest has been calculated.  , You can have your lawyer file a motion for summary judgment after discovery ends. In this motion, you argue that there are no issues in dispute and that you are entitled to win the lawsuit based on the facts and the law.You should hire an attorney to draft this motion for you. It requires familiarity with the law in your state.  , You can make the lawsuit go away if you agree to pay off the entire balance of fees owed. Make a lump sum offer to cover all past-due fees, including late charges and interest.If the HOA is suing you for changes to your property or landscaping, then you could agree to not make the changes. However, if you have already re-designed your house or planted trees, then you might not want to quickly agree to undo the changes.  , If you are being sued for unpaid association fees, then you should calculate how much of the balance you can pay. You might want to negotiate for a reduction in past-due fees. For example, if you owe $2,000, then you might want to get it reduced to $1,000.   Before proposing negotiation, you should figure out how much you can afford. You don’t want to negotiate a reduction and then find out you can’t pay even that amount.  , Have your lawyer call the HOA’s attorney and propose negotiation. Some HOAs are willing to negotiate while others are not.You won’t know if this is an option unless you ask. If the HOA board is willing to negotiate, then remember the following:   Always stay calm. If you think the members of the HOA board are angry, do not act the same way. Don’t return threats with threats of your own. Instead, take deep breaths and think before you speak. Ask questions. One way to get the upper-hand in negotiations is to ask the other side questions. For example, you could ask if any other homeowners have been late on their fees and whether they have been sued. If the answer is no, then the HOA board will look unreasonable in suing you. Be flexible. If the HOA board won’t immediately agree to your offer to pay a portion of your overdue fees, then ask them if you can take a few more minutes to brainstorm additional solutions. Try to be open to their suggestions., Your HOA might not want to reduce your overdue fees. However, it might agree to set up a payment plan. In this way, you can pay off the past-due fees over a set period of time.   Some states might require the HOA to offer you this option. In Colorado, for example, HOAs must make a good faith effort to set up a payment plan with homeowners who are behind on their fees., If your HOA agrees to reduce the amount of past-due fees or agrees to set up a payment plan, you should get that agreement in writing. Otherwise, the HOA might continue with its lawsuit.  , Depending on the lawsuit, you might pick a jury. You can get a jury trial if you are being sued for money. However, if the plaintiff is suing you for an injunction, then you typically will appear only before a judge.   To pick a jury, the judge asks prospective jurors a series of questions about their lives, for example, what job they work, what their hobbies are, etc. The judge will also ask each juror if he or she can be fair. You might think a juror will be biased, particularly if the juror admits to having made up its mind already without hearing any evidence. In this situation, you can ask the judge to dismiss the juror for cause. You might also have some peremptory challenges you can use. When you use a peremptory challenge, you do not need the judge’s permission to dismiss the juror and you do not need to state a reason., Each side may deliver an opening statement. As the party which filed the lawsuit, the HOA will go first. Your attorney will then go second.   If you are representing yourself, then you will need to make the opening statement. Try to keep it brief. Jurors do not have a long attention span. Judges don’t either. Explain what evidence you will introduce and what it will prove. Use the opening statement as a roadmap to your evidence.Summarize your key facts. If you are arguing that the Homeowners Association didn’t properly calculate your fees, you could say, “As the evidence will show, the defendant submitted a check for $750 on June 30. The evidence will also show that this check was never credited to his account. Instead, the plaintiff deposited the check into a different homeowner’s account.”  , The HOA will present evidence and witnesses first. You have the opportunity of cross-examining them. You should do so if you think the witness lacks credibility or is wrong about its facts.  , If you have a lawyer, he or she will question you. However, if you don’t have a lawyer, then you can deliver your testimony in a speech. Regardless of how you testify, you should expect the HOA’s attorney to cross-examine you.   On cross examination, it is important that you remain calm. Anger will only show the jury how unreasonable you can be. You also shouldn’t look at your lawyer during cross-examination. Instead, sit up straight, take a breath, and think about your answer before delivering it to the jury., When all evidence has been presented, you can deliver closing argument to the jury. You should summarize the evidence and show how it commands a result in your favor.   Make sure to remind the jury of specific pieces of evidence. If the evidence exists as an exhibit or document admitted into evidence, then you can show it to the jury to remind them.  For example, you could say, “Remember when Mr. Douglas, the Homeowners Associations’ president testified? How he didn’t deny that he had received a check. Instead, his precise words were, ‘I don’t remember.’ I don’t remember. But there was evidence that the check was cashed. In fact, you were shown the cancelled checks. They’re right here. So we know the defendant paid the fees for 2014.”    , The judge reads the jury its instructions and then the jury will retire to deliberate. If your case was heard by the judge, then she might deliver a decision immediately after closing argument or take some time to think it over.  , If you lose at trial, you have the right to appeal. You can ask the clerk court for a Notice of Appeal form and file it.If you want to appeal, you shouldn’t wait. Your state law will give you only so much time to file, often less than 30 days.   Talk with a lawyer before filing an appeal. Appeals can be expensive. You have to order court transcripts, and you can’t refuse to pay the court judgment against you as you wait for the appeal to finish. Instead, you either need to pay the plaintiff or get a bond.A lawyer can help you understand whether your case is strong enough to warrant paying these costs.

"['do one thing at a time', 'focus wholly on what you are doing.a major part of mindfulness is being absorbed in the present moment', 'pay attention to sensations', 'be aware of your emotions', 'take your time.to be fully present in the moment and experience everything about it', 'you’ve got to slow down', 'redirect your mind', 'be mindful about everything']",How to Reduce Anxiety with Mindfulness2," Focusing on more than one thing (multi-tasking) forces your mind to be scattered, this makes it easier for anxiety-producing thoughts to pop up. Being mindful means focusing on only one thing and focusing on that thing completely.Often we multitask without even realizing it. For example, we eat lunch while checking email or talk on the phone while editing a report. Think about what you are about to do before you do it, and then commit to doing just that activity. Stop yourself when you find that you have started multitasking and return your focus to your one task.  , If your mind is completely occupied with what you are doing, then there is less opportunity for anxiety-inducing thoughts to creep in.When possible, reduce the number of distractions around you so that you can focus only on the task at hand. When it is not possible to reduce distractions, be mindful of them, but don’t let them grab your attention.  , Getting used to recognize your sensations while make it easier for you to be mindful of them during times of high anxiety and will decrease the number of anxiety-starting thoughts that you have on a regular basis.Be aware of what you see, hear, feel, taste, and smell.   For example, while cooking dinner, pay attention to the different textures and colors of the ingredients, the sounds of your cooking tools, the aromas that are produced, etc. When brushing your teeth, notice how the toothpaste tastes and smells. How does the toothbrush feel in your hand? Pay attention to the feel of it on your teeth, tongue, and gums.  , While you are performing your task, think about how performing it makes you feel. Think about how the sensations of the task make you feel. You will be able to better recognize and handle your emotions when you are anxious if you make a habit of being aware of them.For example, when you are taking a walk, be aware of your sense of peace and calm. Think about how the fresh air in your lungs makes you feel proud that you are taking care of your health.  , Slowing down helps prevent anxiety by slowing your mind in general. It also gives you the opportunity to halt anxiety by fully focusing on what you are engaged in., The goal of mindfulness is to stay present in the moment. Being able to bring your mind back to the moment can decrease the number of anxiety-producing thoughts that enter your head during difficult situations.   When you notice that your thoughts have drifted, move them back to your task at hand.For example, you might say to yourself, “I’m worrying about my report that is due next week, but I don't need to think about that right now. I’m going to focus on driving instead.”  , Although life can often pull you in many different directions, try to practice mindfulness in everything you do. Whether it’s washing dishes, eating, journaling, etc., do it mindfully. Practicing mindfulness at every opportunity will make it much easier for you to do it when you are feeling anxious.

The things to cover include:   What is the event? Is it formal, semi-formal, or all-out casual but nice? Is it a formal party or are you just casually hanging with your friends? What season is it? What will the weather/temperature probably be on the day/night?; , These might be friends, a spouse, your children, etc. Then make use of them for the following questions:   What are you wearing? (Only needed if you're in so much doubt, you can't figure out what to choose.) Which of my outfits do you think I look great in?  , Fix up any tears, loose hems, stains, etc. or get them to a dry cleaners.  , If it is cold, wear warmer clothing, if it is hot, wear cooler clothing. If you really must wear something you'll freeze in, add a coat or jacket. Do not wear anything you'll boil in, it is nigh on impossible to feel comfortable and you may faint or get heat stroke.  , It might be fashionable, but does it fit and look great on you? If not, don't force yourself into it. Instead, stick with whatever makes you look wonderful. Gone are the days when only one style ruled the roost. You are liberated enough now to be able to choose what brings forth your best features. It's okay if it's not the textbook outfit to wear, it's more important that you feel confident with what you have on.   You can give a nod to current trends by adding an accessory that sums up the trend, be it by color, shape or logo.  , When everything is popping out or you can't distinguish your frame, the look fails to present you at your best. If something is really great and not in your size, get it tailored. A well-tailored outfit is always worth the effort and expense.  , Fashion doesn't always care about comfort but you should, especially if whatever you're going to requires you to stand a long time, or sit on hard seats, or be blown about by a cold breeze while pretending to like the weather. Think about the venue too––heels on a lawn party will soon grow really exhausting, while running around in just a bikini at the pool party will be less desirable when it comes time to evening drinks indoors at the bar.  , These are especially useful when you are not sure what the day holds; a cute knee length skirt, layered tanks, and a light jacket will go almost anywhere. Peel or add layers to add or subtract formality. At nighttime, add some eye liner, high heels, maybe an over sized accessory and you'll get a whole new nighttime look.  , Tons of accessories aren't necessary.

Opt for silver if you want your locket to withstand wear and tear without paying the price for gold. Alternative metals that are popular include cobalt, tungsten carbide, ceramic, stainless steel and titanium.If you have cool skin tones, your ideal metals are light or white. For example, platinum, white gold and silver. If you have warm skin tones, you’ll look best in yellow gold, rose gold, copper or brass. People with neutral skin tones can wear any shade of metal.; , If you have a cool skin tone, look for gemstones in cool tones like red, blue and purple. If you have a warm skin tone, try yellow, green or orange gemstones. You may want to wear your birthstone or the birthstones of loved ones.Examples of gemstones for cool skin tones are ruby, amethyst, sapphire and aquamarine.Examples of gemstones for warm skin tones are citrine, emerald and peridot.  , Some of the available shapes are round, heart-shaped, oval and square. Choose a heart-shaped locket for a romantic vibe, or to give to a partner as a gift.A round or oval locket is versatile and makes a good gift for someone who is not your romantic partner.For example, you may want to give a heart-shaped locket as a gift for an anniversary or Valentine’s Day.  , Get a locket in a standard shape with minimal ornamentation for a piece to wear with many outfits. Alternately, go for a unique locket to wear as a statement piece.   A simple locket is often round or oval, and may be plain on the face or have a lightly discernible etched pattern. Look for lockets in unique shapes like an oyster, or with an interesting detail – for example, a butterfly perched on a heart locket., Choose a chain that allows the locket to sit at your collarbone, by your heart, or just below your bustline. Alternately, choose a long slide chain if you want the locket to sit near your naval. Opt for thin chains if your locket is dainty and formal. Wear a thin or chunky chain for a casual vibe.Wrap or double-wrap a slider chain to change the length of your necklace.Try different chains with the same locket for different ways to wear the same pendant., Choose an image to display in your locket. Press a piece of tracing paper into the recess of your locket. Trace around it with a pencil to get the shape you’ll need to cut your photo down to.Use an image of one of your loved ones to fit into your locket. For example, you may want to frame a small photo of a family member, spouse or pet in your locket. Other options are an image of a religious icon, or a Victorian picture for a vintage feel.If you’re printing out an image, opt for a grayscale print on regular paper. Photo paper absorbs less ink and can fade more easily.  , Choose a small memento, such as a lock of hair, bit of ribbon, or a dried flower petal. Or take a small square of fabric, dip it in perfume or scented oil, and close it in your locket.Think outside the box! If your locket opens and closes, you can put a little souvenir in it that has meaning only to you. For instance, a small piece of a ticket stub.  , Take your locket to a jeweler or engraver to get custom text written on your locket. Choose words or letters that are meaningful to you. These can be initials, a name, a date, or a phrase.For example, you may want to engrave a few song lyrics, a Bible verse, or a short literary quote. If your locket isn’t an engravable metal or you want a more temporary option, print the words on paper and display them inside your locket instead.  , Wear black or solid color top to give the most focus to your locket. Avoid layering on other necklaces or pendants. Keep your locket clean so it can shine its best.A top with a high collar helps showcase the locket entirely over the fabric you’re wearing. Alternately, if your locket falls at the collarbone, you can choose to wear a top with a neckline that cuts just below the locket. Try wearing a lace blouse to compliment the vintage feel.  , If you wear other jewelry, try to keep the metal or shade consistent with that of your locket. Keep earrings minimal so as not to distract from your locket. Try bracelets with charms to mimic the dangle of your locket pendant.   For example, you may want to wear simple hoops or stud earrings.  , Wear a locket with any casual outfit – such as jeans, a tank top, and a loose cardigan. Don a simple sweater for casual or business casual attire, to give your locket all the attention. Wear a short chain if your top’s neckline is below your collarbone and a long chain if your neckline is at or above your collarbone.   For example, pair a locket on a short chain with a scoop-neck tee. Wear your locket on a long chain with a v-neck tee and a cool jacket. The locket dangling on a long chain will make the chain mimic the “v” neckline of the top. Try wearing a locket on a long chain over a sweater or casual dress.  , Wear delicate, fine jewelry lockets with business attire, formal wear or even bridal wear. Choose a loose top with butterfly sleeves or a fitted top over a skirt or trousers. Pair a locket with any dress, as long as the neckline allows the locket to properly show. If that’s an issue, wear your locket with a different chain.   For example, dress in a black fitted top and a voluminous white skirt. Choose a top with a boat neckline and wear your locket over the shirt. Wear your locket around your neck or attached to a bridal bouquet to incorporate it into your wedding.","['stand-out locket', 'different shapes', 'item', 'sentimental item', 'chain', 'casual outfit', 'photo', 'formal outfit', 'metal', 'locket', 'jewelry', 'select gem embellishments']"

Many health tests cannot be run on dogs until they are two years of age, so you should only breed your male dog when he is of age and cleared for breeding.Depending on your dog’s breed, he may not be able to mate successfully after the age of seven years old. You may need to speak to your vet to confirm your dog is healthy enough to breed if he is over seven years old.; , Some male dogs may experience infertility or difficulties with breeding because they are too young or too old for breeding, they have a low sperm count, or they have a disease or disorder. You should confirm your dog is fertile and able to mate with a female dog before you proceed with the breeding process. Your vet can do a physical exam of your dog’s genital area and run tests to confirm your dog is fertile.Your vet will exam your dog’s reproductive anatomy and his prostate. They will also collect semen from your dog to be examined. If your dog is older, the vet may also require a sperm sample for testing. Your vet may also ask you about your dog’s history of breeding. For example, they may ask, “Has your dog mated successfully with a female before?” “How many litters has your dog sired?” “What issues does your dog seem to have during mating?”  , Once your vet has run tests and examined your dog, they should tell you if your dog is fertile or infertile. If your dog is having fertility problems and he is young in age, your vet may tell you to wait one year and then have him retested to see if his fertility improves with age.If your dog has a thyroid issue that results in a low spear count, your vet may recommend thyroid replacement or a hormone replacement. If your dog has prostate issues, such as an infection, your vet may recommend antibiotics and hormone therapy.  , Before you breed your male dog, you should confirm he is in good health. Ask your vet to do a complete physical exam on your dog to check for health issues like hip dysplasia and joint problems. You want to be sure your dog does not have these health issues as you do not want them passed on to his litter when he does breed with a female dog.Your vet should also check his ears and his eyes to ensure they are in good working condition. You should have your vet run a blood test and a urinalysis to check for any diseases or disorders, such as bone disease.  , You should also have tests done to confirm your dog’s genetic make up, especially if your dog is not a pure breed. Having clear information on your dog’s genetics can help you match him with a mating partner and get a good idea of the genetic makeup of any puppies he sires. You can arrange for a genetic test through your vet or through a trusted online testing service. You will need to provide a swab sample from your dog to complete the genetic test.The cost of a genetic test can range from $60 to $150. These tests will tell you about the dog's heritage and therefore any diseases they are at greater risk of carrying. They do not, however, tell you if a dog carries the gene for those diseases or not.  , Study the standard for your dog’s breed and confirm he is a healthy example of his breed. Research your dog’s breed on through the breed’s national parent club to find out more about what traits your dog should possess in order to breed. Some traits may be physical, such as a certain color to his coat or a certain shape to his body. Some traits may be behavioral, such as a certain demeanor or personality to your dog.You can also speak to other pet owners who have the same breed to get a sense of the standards for the breed. You want to ensure your male dog is a high example of his breed, as this will increase the quality of any litters he sires.  , You may want to establish your male dog as a stud that is suitable for breeding so you can find female mates for him more easily. Part of doing this is ensuring you know the ideal female mate for your dog. Make sure the dam complements your dog. Go for a dam who has a strong bloodline and qualities that will suit your dog’s qualities, such as physical appearance or level of intelligence.You should also look for a female dog that has a temperament that is calm, collected, and friendly, as this often indicates she will be a good mating partner. Make sure the female dog is in good health and does not have any genetic issues. This will ensure the resulting litter is free of health problems or deficiencies.  , Though not required, registering your dog with the American Kennel Club (AKC) will let other owners know that your dog is recognized as a suitable option for breeding. You will need to have certified ownership of your dog to register him with the AKC.You can find out more on registering your dog with the American Kennel Club by looking at their website or by contacting them by phone.  , Once you have decided to make your dog available for breeding, you should draw up a stud contract. A stud contract should cover where the breeding will occur, as well as outline the stud fees, which will be set by you, the male dog’s owner. You may request a cash fee, a “pick of the litter,” or one or two puppies from the resulting litter. The contract should be signed by you and by the owner of the female dog before the breeding takes place.If you are unsure how much to charge in the stud contract, talk to your dog’s breeder or the American Kennel Club for guidance. If your dog has not been used as a stud before, you may charge the female dog owner a nominal fee to cover health checks and fertility checks as part of the contract.

It may even make the cat's prey instinct kick in more, spurring it on to bite down harder.Instead, stop moving and reacting to the cat. This will take away all the fun the cat gets from the attack.  If you don't ""play"" with the cat any further, it will likely lose interest and release its claws or teeth.; , If the cat has its claws or teeth in you, then you need to work on getting the cat to remove them. Instead of pulling away, try push toward the cat further. This will hopefully confuse the cat, prompting it to let go.Pressing towards the cat will get the cat to release because prey don't usually move toward the cat after an attack.  , Hitting or smacking the cat will only increase the stress and aggression it is feeling. While physical resistance may be your first response when being attacked, resist that urge.You can, however, use a strong and stern voice to admonish the attacking cat. This will show the cat your displeasure while not increasing its attacking instinct.  , Making a loud noise can shock the cat into releasing its grip if it is unwilling to give up on its attack. Try making a loud noise or throw something across your room that will make a loud noise when it hits the floor.You can try to shock the cat by simply clapping very loudly.  , If all else fails, you may need to restrain the cat. This can usually be done most easily during an attack by scruffing the cat. Holding the cat by the scruff will disable the cat and allow you to get control of it.  Scruffing a cat needs to be done with caution. Holding the cat by the loose skin at the back of the neck in the right way is not painful, but doing it wrong can injure the cat.Ask your veterinarian how to scruff a cat and try it on a cat that is docile. This will assure that you know how to do it before you have to do it to a cat that is out of control.  , Once you have gotten the attacking cat off of you, walk away from it. Do not interact with the cat at all and just move away from it. This will help to diffuse the situation.  An aggressive cat is likely to continue its behavior if it gets a reaction or interaction due to the attack. This is especially helpful in dealing with a kitten that is playing too aggressively. Withdrawing your attention if the cat plays too roughly will show it that the fun stops when they play too hard., Do not keep an aggressive cat in a room if it doesn't want to stay. Allow it to leave if it wants to so that it can go off on its own and cool down. For example, cats may act aggressively if they are scared, so letting it flee instead of keeping it in a fearful situation will reduce its stress and allow it to stop being aggressive.Sometimes a cat will attack because it did not want to be interacted with. If this is the case for you, then you should allow it to get the alone time that it wanted.  , If the cat is wild and you are fearful that it will continue to attack you, or injure itself, you may need to isolate it. This can be done most effectively and humanely by locking it in a room by itself until it has completely calmed down. There are other options as well, however, such as getting it into a cat carrier.  Getting a cat into a cat carrier can be done most easily with the help of another person. If you place an aggressive cat in a room by itself for longer than an hour or so, you should supply a litter box, food, and water for it.  , Aggression in cats can sometimes be caused by medical problems. If your cat is feeling unwell or suffering, it could make the animal angry or unpleasant. To make sure that a health problem is not the cause of your cat's aggression, you should have it looked at by a veterinarian.Some medical problems that can cause aggression in cats include dental disease, arthritis, and hyperthyroidism.  , If your cat's health is fine, then its aggression has another cause. You should assess its living conditions to try and figure out what it causing its anger. The aggression may be caused by factors such as dirty litter, territory disputes with other cats, or previous trauma. If you think your cat is unhappy about one of these things, change it.It is best to figure out the source of your cat's aggression as soon as possible once aggression starts. This will help you to stop the cat's aggression from becoming habit.  , Once you have eliminated any health or situational problems that are causing your cat to attack, you should work on training it not to attack any more. This training should include interrupting aggressive behavior before it escalates. For instance, startling a cat before it attacks can sidetrack the cat from attacking.You should not use physical punishment or physical contact when training your cat not to attack. This will likely cause the cat to become more fearful and unsettled, thus increasing the likelihood of an attack. If your cat is food focused, then treats can be used to reward non-aggressive behavior. For example, if your cat is aggressive toward strangers, you can give visitors treats they can give to the cat if it is calm with them.  , If you have figured out what triggers your cat's aggression, then you should try to keep it out of those situations. For example, if your cat is triggered by strangers in your home, then you should keep it sequestered away when strangers come to your home., If you have tried to ease your cat's aggression and have not had any success, then it's time to call in a professional. Contact your veterinarian and see what they can do about your cat's aggression. You can also contact a professional pet trainer or therapist to help your cat overcome its aggression.Your veterinarian may suggest giving your cat medication in combination with behavioral training. This can ease your cat's stress and minimize aggressive outbursts.

Copyright doesn't last forever. After the copyright expires, a book falls into the public domain and anyone can publish it. As a general rule, anything published in the United States before 1923 is in the public domain.However, keep in mind that later editions of a book that is in the public domain may not themselves be in the public domain. For example, although Shakespeare is clearly in the public domain, if you want the digital rights for an illustrated edition of Romeo and Juliet published in 1995, that edition is not in the public domain.If a work was created between 1923 and 1978, the author or copyright holder was required to renew copyright protection after 28 years. Many works created during that time have fallen into the public domain because the copyright was not renewed, but it will take some research to find out if that's the case.A 1992 federal law made renewal automatic for works published between 1964 and 1978, so those works along with works created from January 1, 1978 to the present typically will be covered by copyright.In the United States, books have copyright protection for the life of the author plus 70 years.If the book was written outside the United States, you must find out in which countries (if any) the book was published, and research the copyright laws of those countries to determine whether you can publish it in the U.S. and who you would need to contact to secure permission. Note that copyright protection was triggered by publishing for earlier works, while later works (those created on or after January 1, 1978) have copyright protection from the moment they are created.Older works that remained unpublished, such as personal diaries, are treated the same as works created after 1978. This means that if the author of the work died 70 years ago, the work is now in the public domain.You can start your search by looking at the copyright notice of the book, if it has one. The date on the copyright notice typically is the date the work was published.; , Since copyright protection begins the moment a work is created, if the book is unpublished in any form the copyright may not be registered.   Registration is not a requirement for copyright protection of books created on or after January 1, 1978.You can search records created from 1978 to the present on the Copyright Office's website. The search includes copyright registration as well as any other recorded documents such as licenses or transfers of copyright ownership.The online system gives you the option of searching by title, name, or registration or document number. You also can do a keyword search. You should only do a title search if you know the exact title – otherwise, do a keyword search.You also have the option of limiting your search in various ways, such as by the year of registration or by the type of item registered.Since you're looking for a book, it makes sense to limit your search to recorded documents and text so other items such as music, motion pictures, and sound recordings will be eliminated from your search results.  , If the book is protected by copyright, you must get permission from the rights holder – typically either the author or the publisher – to publish or distribute the book in digital format.   If the book has a copyright notice, the name on the copyright notice typically is the name of the author. When you searched Copyright Office records, the copyright registration certificate also had the name and contact information of the owner of the copyright.If the book has not been published, you must find contact information for the author of the book. For example, if you want the digital rights to an unpublished manuscript, the author's name probably is on the manuscript – but his or her address or phone number may not be. In this situation, you would need to do a bit of basic detective work to find the contact information for the author (assuming he or she is still alive).  , Building a preliminary plan for how you would use the digital rights can help you determine how much you should spend on the license.   In addition to deciding how much you're willing to pay for digital rights, this exercise will give you an understanding of the expenses of your project. If you're planning on advertising the e-book you create, you also might want to get general figures of those costs. Keep in mind that typically royalty rates or amounts are not decreased by costs for advertising, marketing, or promotions.Your costs also help you figure out how long you need your license to last. For example, if you anticipate it will cost you $100,000 to produce and market the e-book, and you plan to sell the e-book for $10 with a 50 percent royalty rate, you'll have to sell 20,000 copies before you break even. How long it will take to sell 20,000 copies will depend generally on how well you market the book and the demand for the book or the author.  , Before you speak with the rights holder, you should have a good idea of the maximum amount you're willing to spend to purchase the digital rights to the book.   Typically you're going to provide a certain royalty rate on sales, but the author or publisher also may expect a lump-sum advance. In addition, if you're planning on distributing the e-book for free, you'll have to work out a purchase price since royalties won't be applicable. Create a range that's realistic. The minimum you're willing to spend may be zero, but asking the author or publisher to give you digital rights to the book for free is probably not going to fly. However, this depends on your situation and the use to which you want to put those rights. For example, if you work with a non-profit organization that provides support for the families of children with cancer, and you want the digital rights to a memoir written by the mother of a child with cancer to distribute to the families, you might stand a chance of getting those digital rights for little to no money.  , Once you've settled your negotiating range and strategy, write the rights holder and express your interest in purchasing the digital rights to the book.   Introduce yourself and identify the book for which you want digital rights. Explain what you intend to do with the book and how you're going to handle distribution. If you already have ballpark figures for royalty rates and terms, you might include those in the letter as well as starting points for negotiation. However, keep in mind that the author or publisher has not yet accepted your offer to negotiate. They may be unwilling to license these rights, so you may want to keep the details to yourself until you at least know that they're open to discussion. Provide contact information for yourself and give them a preferred time frame to get back to you – but be polite about it. This isn't a deadline. You want to do business with them, and it's important to start on collegial footing. Simply say something like ""I'd love to hear back from you within the next month,"" or ""if I don't hear from you in two weeks, I'll assume you're not interested.""  , The rights holder should have a full understanding of the work for which you want digital rights and how you intend to use those rights.   Digital rights can be rather broad. The value of those rights may change depending on whether you plan on publishing an e-book that essentially is just like a print book, or whether you want to create a so-called enhanced e-book with videos, photos, and links. Additionally, there are different types of e-books and digital rights. An e-book must be formatted separately for different platforms. For example, you would have to create two versions using entirely different code and formatting rules if you wanted to publish the book for Amazon's Kindle and Apple's iBook. These are separate digital rights that can be parceled out by the rights holder accordingly. Just because you have the rights to publish an e-book for Kindle does not necessarily mean you have the rights to publish the e-book on any other platform.Also, keep in mind that internet rights are one subset of digital rights. Selling an e-book through internet retailers does not require internet rights; however, if you plan to have the book's text itself available to read on a website, you specifically need internet rights.Make sure you and the rights holder are on the same page regarding what you intend to do with the digital rights to the book once you get them, which will enable you to draw up a more specific agreement. It's doubtful that an author or publisher would agree to grant a license for something as broad as ""digital rights"" without a detailed description of what you're permitted to do.  , You and the rights holder will need to come to an agreement on how, when, and where you will be able to publish or distribute the book under the license.   Keep in mind that for the author or publisher, the goal is to make the most money through a limited license for a short period of time.The more expansive the rights you want, the more expensive the license will be. You also must come to an agreement on whether your rights will be exclusive or non-exclusive.If you get non-exclusive digital rights, this means others can publish the book digitally as well, even on the same platform and in the same geographic area as you do. Non-exclusive rights may be preferred if, for example, you want to publish the e-book solely for distribution to members of a non-profit organization. However, if you plan on marketing the e-book commercially, you probably want exclusive rights. If you're planning on selling the e-book on the internet using retailers such as Amazon, you probably want to negotiate for worldwide rights. This enables the e-book to be sold in other countries, not just on the U.S. versions of those retailers' websites.  , How payments are structured may depend on whether you're negotiating with the author or with a publishing company.   Publishing companies typically have their own schedules, and will expect you to follow those schedules and their accounting procedures as well. You also may consider having an accelerating royalty rate, in which the rate increases after a certain number of books are sold. The idea is that the author gets a lower rate while you're still trying to recoup your costs, but after you break even, the author gets a higher rate. The National Writer's Union recommends a royalty rate of 35 percent of the list price for e-books. If you're tying the rate to net proceeds rather than list price, consider a royalty rate somewhere between 50 and 70 percent.Make sure you have the correct information for the rights holder for the method of payment upon which you've both decided. For example, if you plan to pay royalties through direct deposit to the author's checking account, you need to have the bank name, account number and routing number for their account, as well as their name as listed on that account.  , Typically the rights will revert to the author after a certain period of time.   The author or publisher will argue for a short duration, but you need the license to last long enough for you to recoup your costs in producing the e-book and make a profit. Rather than have the license end on a certain date, you might tie the term of the license to the number of books sold – with an ultimate end date some point well into the future in the event the sales aren't made. This strategy ensures you'll make a profit since the rate of sales is somewhat uncertain. For example, if you've determined you'll have to sell 20,000 copies to recoup your costs, you might argue for the rights to revert after 100,000 copies are sold, or 20 years from the date the license goes into effect. You also might have sales of a certain amount of copies trigger a renegotiation of the license, rather than having the rights automatically revert to the author or publisher.  , Issues such as how the license can be revoked, what happens in the event of a breach of the contract, and the rights and responsibilities of both parties should be worked out in advance.   For example, if copyright of the book is not yet registered, you probably want to include copyright registration in the agreement. Typically it would be the author's responsibility to complete registration. Choice of law and forum may be particularly important, particularly if the author is a citizen of another country. Assuming you are a U.S. citizen, you want to make sure the license is governed by U.S. law and any lawsuits arising from breach of contract will be litigated in a court that's convenient for you.  , You may be able to find contracts written to transfer digital rights in other books that you can use to help.   Since there's no particular format or wording requiredunder federal copyright lawfor licensing the digital rights to a book, you may have difficulty finding a sample you can use as a straight template. However, you may be able to find similar documents that licensed the digital rights of other books that you can use as guides to make sure your language is correct.Writer's unions and organizations may have sample agreements on their websites. However, keep in mind these agreements naturally will be skewed in favor of the writer. Read the clauses carefully and eliminate anything that puts you at a disadvantage or that wasn't specifically negotiated.  , Even if you draft the license agreement yourself, you might have an attorney look over the finished product and make sure you didn't miss anything and that all the language is clear.   If you're concerned about the cost of hiring an attorney, you can shop around. Look for an attorney experienced in publishing contracts or copyright license agreements. Make sure you find someone with experience in books. A highly experienced copyright attorney with tremendous respect who works primarily in the music industry may not know much about the publishing industry. Each type of work subject to copyright has its own rules, and the industry surrounding it has its own standards. Keep in mind that if the contract is breached in some way and you end up in court, litigation will be longer and more expensive if you also have to haggle over differing interpretations of certain clauses in the agreement.  , Your agreement should begin by providing a date and the full legal name of both you and the rights holder and identifying the roles of each of you relative to the agreement.   Include addresses for each party. You also may want to include a brief name to refer to each party throughout the rest of the agreement. For example, if you are entering into an agreement with the author of the book, you might write ""hereinafter 'Author'"" after his or her name.Many licensing agreements include a preamble,but this is not strictly necessary. The preamble simply tells a story about the agreement, essentially stating that since one party owns the rights to the book and the other party wants to publish the book, you are entering into this legally binding contract to make that happen. However, the use of ""whereas"" and ""therefore"" clauses can make the agreement feel more formal.  , List the book specifically by title and include the copyright registration number if the work's copyright has been registered.   If you're planning on recording the agreement with the Copyright Office, the registration number must be included.As with the names of the parties, you may want to include a brief name to refer to the book throughout the rest of the agreement so you don't have to keep repeating the full title. Additionally, continuing to use the full title could get confusing – especially if, for example, the title has punctuation within it such as commas or a semi-colon. You can refer to the book simply as ""Book"" throughout the agreement, although you may want to use something based on the title itself.  , Your agreement should make clear what you're allowed to do pursuant to the license.   Be as specific as possible, using the terms to which you and the author or publisher agreed during your negotiations. For example, if you only discussed publishing an e-book for Kindle, you should list that rather than using a general term such as ""digital rights"" that could be read as giving you more rights than you actually bargained for. You'll want to note whether the license is exclusive or non-exclusive, and the territory within which the use will be exercised. If you're leaving open the option to sell the book internationally, for example, you would need worldwide rights. However, if you only have permission to distribute the book in the United States, your territory should be limited accordingly.  , Your agreement must include the date it begins and the date it ends.If the end date is conditional on sales or other factors, state these specifically. You also may need to include details on how those sales will be calculated and how often figures will be reviewed. The start of the agreement also may be conditional. For example, if copyright has not yet been registered, the license may not begin until registration is complete. If you're licensing an unpublished manuscript, you may not want the license to begin until the author has delivered the manuscript to you.  , This section should include details regarding how those royalties are calculated, how often those calculations will be made, and the terms and conditions under which the author or publisher can request an audit of your records.   Specify what the royalty rate is based on, whether gross proceeds, net proceeds, or list price. Basing your royalty rate on the list price makes the accounting simpler and is more transparent for the author, since he or she has no way of knowing what your costs are or how many copies of the book have sold. You may wish to include a minimum payment. For example, the agreement may state that payments are to be made on the 20th of every month, but if $100 has not accrued, the amount will be rolled over to the next month rather than paid., Add clauses as necessary to cover all responsibilities you discussed as well as rules in the event the contract is breached.   For example, you'll want to include a warranty from the author that he or she is the owner of the copyright and the work does not infringe anyone else's copyright.Describe the ways the agreement can be terminated, and what constitutes breach of the agreement. You'll also want to lay out where lawsuits regarding the contract can be filed, what court has jurisdiction over the agreement, and what law governs it., Once you've finished the substantive paragraphs of your agreement, you're ready to clean it up and make it official.   Create signature blocks at the end of the agreement that include the full legal names of both parties. If you're dealing with a publisher, you should include the publisher's name and the full legal name of the individual signing the agreement on the publisher's behalf. No particular formatting is required for a license, but you may want to use certain styles to organize the document and make it easier to read and understand. For example, you may want to provide a title for each section of the agreement and bold those titles.You also should consider numbering your paragraphs, as this makes it easier to reference the document later. After you've finished drafting the agreement, proofread it carefully and then give the final draft to the author or publisher so they can read through it. You may have another round of negotiations if the author or publisher doesn't like a particular clause you've included, or doesn't agree with how you've worded certain terms.  , Your license will not be legally binding until it has been signed by both parties.   You may wish to sign the agreement in front of a notary public. This will add a little more formality to your signing, as well as provide verification for the signatures in the even they're questioned. After the agreement is signed, make several copies so both you and the author or publisher have copies for your records. If you're planning on recording the agreement with the Copyright Office, you may want to sign two copies so that you have two originals.  , Although recordation of copyright licenses isn't mandatory, it establishes a public record of the transfer and can prevent conflict later.If you want to record your agreement with the copyright office, it generally must contain original signatures rather than being a copy. The document also must be legible and complete on its own terms.When you file the agreement to be recorded, you'll have to pay a filing fee. The basic fee to have a document recorded is $105 provided the document references a single transaction involving a single title.You can record your agreement by mailing it, along with a check or money order for the fee, to Library of Congress, U.S. Copyright Office-DOC, 101 Independence Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20559.

"['add drainage to poorly draining soil', 'move plants that are placed too closely together', 'avoid adding too much mulch', 'cut off any dead or diseased plants', 'avoid over-watering your plants', 'make sure you don’t plant your plants too deeply']",How to Take Care of Plants3," If your garden patch or potted plant constantly has a pool of water sitting on top, then the soil is poorly draining. This is bad, because the buildup of water can cause the roots of the plant to rot, killing the plant over time. To remedy this, carefully dig out the plant and a clump of the surrounding soil; place the plant on a tarp or in another clean pot. Mix compost or peat into the soil. Replace your plant in its original location.   If all of your soil is poorly draining, you can dig it up and mix in sand to help increase the drainage.  , If you got a bit over-enthusiastic and planted several plants near each other when they were small, you may have been surprised when they grew up and began competing for space in your garden or indoor pot. Plants that are put too close together will not grow as large, since there are not enough nutrients to be shared between them. Simply dig up the offending plants, and relocate them to a new garden plot or pot that has more room. Fill in the empty space with fresh gardening soil.Always use store-bought gardening soil rather than soil from your yard, as the soil from your yard contains insects, plant diseases, and weeds that will spread to your plant in its new location. You can tell that plants are too close if they are growing into each other, or if their primary stems/branches become tangled.  , While mulching is beneficial for adding nutrients and blocking out weeds, adding too much mulch can be problematic for a garden. This is because the mulch will not only block out weeds, but will also prevent new growth from your plants from breaking the surface. Never add more than a 2-inch thick layer of mulch to your garden. If your garden isn’t growing after you’ve mulched, take off 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of mulch and wait a few weeks for improvement.   If you add mulch too high on the base of a stem or tree, it will cut off valuable sunlight and prevent growth. Move mulch off the base of the stems and tree trunks in your garden.  , Plant disease can spread quickly through a garden, if not contained. The same is true for a plant that is injured; if you don’t remove the dying limbs, it can continue to spread to the rest of the plant. Whenever you notice plants that are yellow, browning, dry, brittle, or otherwise sickly looking, use a pair of gardening shears to cut off the branches from the base.   Throw these branches away rather than leaving them in your garden as compost, because if they do contain a plant disease, it can still spread to nearby plants.  , Although you may think you’re watering your plants correctly, if they begin to turn yellow and droop, you’re probably giving them too much water. Most plant’s don’t need to be watered daily, in fact they do better when given a lot of water every few days. Only water your plants when the soil is dry at least 2-inches deep. If you water every time the top of the soil looks dry, you are almost guaranteed to over-water your plant. If you are having difficulty giving too much water to indoor plants, try switching to a spray bottle for watering your plants, rather than using a watering can. Spray bottles make it much harder to add too much water, since very little is released at one time., If your plants are slowly dying and wilting for no known reason, you may have buried them too deeply. The roots of the plant need to be relatively close to the surface, so that they can extract all the nutrients from the topsoil and have access to the sun. Carefully dig up your plants, and replant them so that the root ball is just-at or just-below the surface of the soil. If the root ball is partially exposed, spread a thin layer of mulch over the top to protect it.   When transplanting a plant from a pot to the garden, keep the soil level at the same depth that it was in the original pot. If your roots are mostly above the surface, your plant will die as well. You want the roots to be level with the garden topsoil.  ","['soil', 'much mulch', 'plants', 'move plants', 'diseased plants', 'drainage']"

Simply avoiding interaction is probably the easiest way to cope.   Some interactions are probably unavoidable, especially if you two work together directly. However, you can avoid chatting with this co-worker in the break room or during downtime. If you notice your co-worker come in, politely excuse yourself by saying something like, ""Well, got to get back to work. Nice seeing you.""When you do have to interact with the co-worker, keep things professional. Avoid bringing up personal matters or things irrelevant to the task at hand as, when dealing with someone who dislikes you, this is an invitation for negative interaction.; , Many psychological studies indicate that it's very difficult to dislike someone who likes you. If your co-worker feels you respect and like him or her, some of the dislike he or she may have towards you might fade.Tell someone else in the office that you like and respect the problem co-worker. That information may get repeated secondhand. When such a message does not come directly from you, your co-worker may be more likely to believe it.Show a genuine interest in your co-worker's input. People tend to like people who pay attention and engage with them. While you should still stick to avoiding this person when possible, during the times you do have to interact listen to what he or she says actively. This might make your co-worker's dislike you less.Small, friendly interactions can help as well. Something as simple as ""good morning"" can go a long way., If you have trouble interacting with a particular colleague, try to separate your work life from your personal life. You do not have to socialize with colleagues outside of work. If the co-worker who dislikes you is frequently part of Friday night happy hours, forego these events and seeing the friends you know from outside work., You do not want to report behavior unnecessarily. However, you should certainly report any behavior that's interfering with your ability to do your job. Talk to Human Resources if the situation gets out of hand.   Management can help negotiate situations if your ability to do your job is threatened. You should keep a record of your interactions for a week or so if you plan to report just so you have solid information to show to officials.Make sure you focus on how your co-worker's behavior affects the company. Speak in objective terms and explain about how productivity and morale are damaged by your co-worker's attitude.Remember, this is a last resort. You do not want to get labeled the office tattletale. You should only report your co-worker if you feel he or she is harassing you, attacking you personally, and is persistent in his or her actions despite your attempts to avoid or rectify the situation., Emotionally, keeping a healthy perspective is one of the best ways to cope with a negative co-worker. Stay focused on your larger dreams and career goals. Avoid getting caught up in petty workplace drama.   When you get frustrated, consider where you want to be in the next year or the next five years. How much does this co-worker really matter when it comes to your longterm goals? How long will you actually be working together? It's more than likely your troublesome co-worker will not be part of your career for the long run.Can you learn from the situation? Try to see the situation as a lesson in how to treat others. If your co-worker's dislike is making work difficult, do not replicate that kind of behavior in any future interactions., While it's easier said than done, sometimes the best way to deal with a negative situation is to find a way to remove yourself emotionally. Try to simply ignore the behavior by refusing to react to it.It can help to engage in relaxation techniques throughout the day. You can try steadying your thoughts by hyper focusing on the present moment. Take stock of your body, your breathing, your surroundings. This will stop you from becoming upset by your co-worker's actions by placing focusing on the physical alone., Whatever you do, do not bad talk your co-worker to other people in the office. This will not only reflect poorly on you, it can easily get back to your co-worker and make the situation worse.   Everyone needs to vent sometimes. It's okay if you want to get your frustrations off your chest. However, keep your venting outside the office. Talk to friends and family members you know from outside work rather than acquaintances from the office., While it might be difficult to accept, there could be something you're doing to make your co-worker dislike you. Try to consider your co-worker's perspective to see if there's been any bad behavior on your part.   Jealousy often fuels dislike. Your co-worker could see you as more successful or see traits in you that he or she lacks. While you can't necessarily eliminate your co-worker's jealousy, consider whether you've been overly smug or boastful about your success. If so, this may be fueling the dislike.People can mistake shyness as rudeness. If you simply do not interact with your co-worker frequently, he or she might think you're cold. Trying to be a bit friendlier can help.Do other people in the office seem to like you? If not, you may be inadvertently engaging in behavior others find off-putting. Try talking to a co-worker you're close to and ask him for objective feedback on your behavior. See if there's anything you're doing that could be off putting to others., Carefully review any past interactions you've had with your co-worker. Sometimes, people dislike others for a single bad interaction. There may have been something you said or did that's fueling the dislike.   It could be something simple, like you not holding the elevator by mistake one day. You could have also accidentally said something insensitive, like a comment on your co-worker's outfit he or she took the wrong way.If you identify any past mistakes on your part, offer your co-worker a sincere apology. If the dislike stems from a simple misunderstanding, it can probably be cleared up with a quick conversation., Be honest with yourself about how much the situation is bothering you. If you're unable to separate your work life from your private life, it may be time to look for another job. Be aware, however, that difficult people exist in every profession. If difficult co-workers really get to you, it might be a good idea to see a therapist about managing your overall stress.

"['identify the most common business bankruptcies', 'decide if you want to continue your business', 'check if you owe too much money', 'analyze if you are personally responsible for business debts']",How to Choose Which Bankruptcy Chapter to File2," There are three primary business bankruptcies you can choose. Not all are available to all business owners. Consider the following:    Chapter 7. This is a “liquidation,” which means the bankruptcy trustee sells your assets and you shut down the business. Unlike a personal Chapter 7, there is no “means test” if most of your debts are business related, and you don’t receive a discharge of debts at the end of the bankruptcy.All business types can choose a Chapter 7. If you are a sole proprietor, however, you can get a discharge because there is no legal distinction between you as a person and your sole proprietorship.  Chapter 11. You can reorganize your business debts and keep your business open with a Chapter 11. You must come up with a repayment plan, which your creditors will vote on. They can either approve the plan or reject it. Even if your creditors reject it, the judge can still approve the plan if it is fair. Chapter 11 is often used by very large publicly-traded companies, but it is available for all business types.  Chapter 13. This bankruptcy is generally only available for sole proprietorships.You can reorganize the business debts and adopt a payment plan that lasts three to five years. The trustee doesn’t sell your assets, and at the end of payment period your unsecured debts are wiped. In many ways, it is like a Chapter 11.  , Go through your financial records and decide whether you think you can make the business profitable. Try to identify why you didn’t succeed initially. If you think your business faced temporary problems, then you might want to continue it by filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.   If you are a sole proprietor, you also have the option of filing a Chapter 13. You might also be able to continue a sole proprietorship by filing Chapter 7 if you can shield your business assets using exemptions. For example, your state might have a “wildcard” exemption you can apply to any assets you own.This will keep the trustee from selling them.  , A Chapter 13 limits the amount of debt you can have. If you have more than the maximum, you’ll need to choose a different bankruptcy option for your business (such as Chapter 11).   Your secured debt cannot exceed $1,184,200. Your unsecured debt cannot exceed $394,725.  , Many businesses are legally distinct from their owners. For example, the owners of corporations and LLCs are typically not personally responsible for business debts. However, exceptions exist:   You might have personally guaranteed a loan. For example, a bank might not have lent your LLC money unless you agreed to be personally responsible for the debt. If you are the owner of a partnership or sole proprietorship, then you are personally liable for business debts unless you were in a limited liability partnership.If you are personally liable on business debts, you should consider filing a personal bankruptcy at the same time as a business bankruptcy. For example, a partnership could file a Chapter 7 and individual partners could file under Chapter 13 for all business debts they are personally responsible for. Sole proprietors only need to file one bankruptcy because the law doesn’t recognize any distinction between you and your business.

"['get all of your supplies', 'clean your walls', 'measure your space', 'apply the tile adhesive', 'firmly attach your tiles', 'completely cover your wall', 'apply grout', 'wipe down tiles', 'seal your tiles', 'enjoy your new tile backsplash!']",How to Install a Kitchen Backsplash1," Installing a traditional tile backsplash in your kitchen requires several different items. Make sure you are fully prepared before starting your project.   The materials you need to have prepared before you begin include your tile, tile adhesive, and grout. Make sure you have the necessary tools, including a notched trowel, tape measure, sponge, level, utility knife, and a tile cutter. You may need spacers for tiles that are not attached together in sections. You may want to use something to cover your countertops during this process to keep them clean.; , In order for the tile adhesive to stick the walls, they must be free of any dust or grease. Wipe them down with a damp rag, and give enough time for them to completely dry.  , It is important to make sure you get a good measurement so you know exactly what size you should cut your tiles.   Choose a stopping point, either directly below your cabinets or at an arbitrary point on the wall. Make sure that you have enough tiles to fill the measured space, as well as a few extras for precaution. Use a level and straight edge to mark your stopping point along the wall.  , Use your trowel to smooth the tile adhesive across the wall, working in small sections. If you apply too much at once, it will begin to dry before you get a chance to attach the tiles.   Always start applying your tiles from the bottom center, and working outwards from there. Don’t apply the tile adhesive to the backs of the tiles, as it will be more difficult to attach them to the wall.  , Press them into the tile adhesive on the wall, using a level to make sure they are even. Push them a few times to make sure they are secured to the wall.   If your tiles are not attached together in sections, use spacers to make sure they are all evenly spaced. Wiggle the tile a little bit against the wall to ensure suction with the adhesive., Attach all remaining tiles to your wall using this method, until you reach the edges. Before you stick your tiles to the edges of the wall, cut off any excess or oddly shaped corners to make sure the fit is perfect.   Always cut out holes for outlets or odd edges prior to attaching the tile to the wall. Any empty spaces can be filled with pieces of spare tile you cut to size with your tile cutter or utility knife.  , Use your (cleaned) trowel to spread grout evenly across the tiles. Don’t worry about covering the tiles, as that is what is supposed to happen. You will remove the unnecessary grout later.   Spread the grout at a 45 degree angle in a sweeping pattern. Allow a few minutes for the grout to set, and then use a damp sponge to clean off excess grout. All of the cracks between the tiles should be filled, while the remaining tiles should be cleaned of all unnecessary grout.  , After the grout has completely dried, clean it off again with a dry cloth.  , If you want, you can apply a grout sealant to help protect your tiles. Add a small line of silicone caulk to the bottom edge of your tile to seal out water and prevent mildew growth.  , Once you have completed all the installation steps, managing your new backsplash is easy. Wipe it down occasionally with a generic kitchen or glass cleaner to keep your backsplash looking its best.","['new tile backsplash', 'supplies', 'tile adhesive', 'grout', 'tiles', 'wall', 'walls', 'space']"

This knowledge may help you to be more patient, learn better ways to communicate with him, and even improve your relationship.   Read general definitions of autism. Focus on books and articles written by autistic people, since they have firsthand experience on what it is like to live as an autistic person. Be careful of your sources; some autism groups that claim to speak for autistic people actually work hard to silence them.; , Autistic people often struggle to communicate in the same ways that non-autistic people do. Some forms of expression may be too nuanced and difficult for them to understand and respond to. This may lead to misunderstandings and problems within a relationship. To avoid these problems, try to be as direct as possible when you speak to your boyfriend.For example, imagine you say something like, “Gina texted me earlier today.” You may expect him to ask you, “About what?” But your boyfriend might not understand that you are trying to have a conversation since you are not asking him a question. Instead, it might be better to ask him, “Do you want to know what Gina said when she texted me today?” or just tell him what she said. Every autistic person is different. Expect to learn and adjust over time as you get to know more about your boyfriend.  , Social situations that are fun or easy for you might be stressful and difficult for your boyfriend. The loudness and crowding of some social situations might cause your boyfriend to feel anxious and have a hard time concentrating on what people are saying. Your boyfriend might also have a hard time making introductions or small talk.Try writing a letter to your boyfriend about what his role is in social gatherings. Use direct language and only discuss one issue at a time. For example, you might write a letter focusing on why you want him to attend parties with you. Work together on making social situations more comfortable for him. Perhaps he'd be able to handle parties if he could slip away to take a break every half hour or so, or if you set a time at which you'd leave early so he'd know he wouldn't have to handle it for much longer.  , Some autistic people do not like to be touched or know when it is appropriate to give physical affection. Therefore, your boyfriend may not know when you want him to hug you or he may not like it when you touch him without warning. Discuss these things with him to make it easier for you to have a better physical connection.   For example, after something upsetting has happened, you could say to your boyfriend, “I'm feeling really upset right now. Could you please give me a hug? It would help me to feel better.”, Some autistic people may have certain routines that help them to feel better. If these routines are disrupted, they may feel anxious and get upset. Try to be understanding about any routines that your boyfriend has that help him to feel more comfortable. Do what you can to avoid disrupting those routines.For example, if your boyfriend goes for a run every day at 7:00pm, be respectful of this time and do not try to prevent him from doing his normal routine.  Stimming, such as flapping hands or watching lights, is another common autism symptom. Assume that these actions are important,even if you don't understand why he does them.  , Every autistic person is different. Your boyfriend might have some very specific challenges that other autistic people do not have. Try asking some questions to better understand his challenges and preferences. This will help you to be more considerate of his needs.For example, you could say something like, “I want to know more about things that you struggle with so that I can be more considerate. What would you say are the challenges that you have because of your autism?” Be sure to ask about his personal boundaries regarding touch. For example, does it bother him to be hugged? Do you need to tell him before you are going to hug him?  , Autistic people may have anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses. Disabled people, particularly people who have trouble with communication and emotional processing (including many autistic individuals), are more at risk for sexual abuse by care givers of many different job roles.or others,and this may lead to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Be sensitive and supportive about any challenges your boyfriend faces.   If he was abused, he may not want to share the details with you. The best way you can help is by respecting his desire not to disclose the details, and by gently offering that he see a doctor (but not pushing him) if he is very stressed.  , There are many stereotypes about autism, like that autistic people are incapable of love or emotions, but these are not true. Autistic people have many emotions just like neurotypicals do they simply express them differently.Be an advocate for autistic people by pointing out incorrect assumptions about the condition when you encounter them. Try starting by saying something like, “I know that ___ is a well-known stereotype about autistic people, but the truth is…” Current research has even shown that autistic people may have deeper or more intense emotional capacities than non-autistic people., Sometimes people who care about each other will tell little white lies or sugar coat the truth out of consideration for their partner’s feelings. Autistic people may not do this. Instead, you might get some very honest answers from your boyfriend. These answers are not meant to be hurtful, it is just how your boyfriend communicates.For example, if you ask your boyfriend, “Do I look good in this yellow top?” you might expect or want him to say yes. But autistic people might respond with “no” if they do not think that you do. Therefore, you may want to avoid asking questions that you think might result in an answer that will upset you. Remember that honesty is your boyfriend's way of trying to help you.  , Since some autistic people struggle to understand sarcasm or other non-literal forms of communication, you may have situations where your boyfriend asks you a lot of questions. Don’t get upset if this happens. Remember, he asks questions because he cares about you and wants to understand you., Remember that body language and other non-verbal cues may be difficult for autistic people to understand. Instead of trying to communicate with your boyfriend using non-verbal cues, say how you are feeling or what you are thinking. By stating your feelings or thoughts instead of trying to get your boyfriend to guess at them, you may avoid an uncomfortable situation or even an argument.   For example, when a non-autistic person like you avoids eye contact, it is often a sign of being disinterested or upset. But for an autistic person, avoiding eye contact is normal and often not a sign of anything.It helps to say ""I'm really stressed today"" or ""I had a bad day.""  By extension, if he fails to make eye contact with you, do not take it as a sign that he's disinterested in you, unless he tells you so.   If he is doing something that bothers you, tell him. Dropping hints or being silent and then snapping at him won't help. Be straightforward so he can understand and make a change. For example, ""Please don't chew with your mouth open. The sound really bothers me.""  , Some autistic people are not sure how to respond to certain situations. But you can help your boyfriend understand what you need and expect of him by telling him how you’d like him to respond in those situations.   For example, imagine that you get annoyed when you tell your boyfriend about your day at work and he tries to advise you on what to do. Just tell him something like, “I appreciate that you want to help me, but I really just need you to listen when I tell you about my day.”  , Autistic people can have trouble initiating things, or may not know what to do and whether it's appropriate. You can make this easier by initiating the things you'd like to happen, whether it's flirting or kissing.   In addition to struggling with social situations, some autistic people lack a drive or an understanding of sexuality or sexual connotations. Therefore, he might say or do something that has a sexual implication or double-entendre that he was totally unaware of.  For example, he might ask you over to a sleepover with him, having completely innocent non-sexual intentions, not understanding that this would be taken as a sexual proposition by most girls. In this case, explain to him that connotations and feelings of intimacy and sexuality go on in a bedroom atmosphere at night between people of the opposite sex, and that social sleepovers are typically reserved for younger participants or groups of the same sex. It could potentially happen that by his avoiding eye contact with you in conversation, because of his autistic nature, he appears to be staring at your breasts or another sensitive part of your body. Don't freak out, or assume that he's being creepy. Simply tell him, ""I don't feel comfortable when you look in that direction"" and direct his gaze to your eyes or somewhere else. If you ever do want to get intimate or sexual with him, be sure that he has a complete understanding of what sexuality is, what it's about, and the nature of what he's consenting to if he consents to the activity.    , Some autistic people are fairly open about their disability, while others prefer if only a few people know. Talk with him about how he feels about his diagnosis, and whom he is okay with you telling.  , Discuss your feelings and thoughts with your boyfriend in a calm, straightforward manner. Although you may be entitled to feeling angry or hurt, a calm, straightforward approach may be much more effective than an emotional reaction. Becoming emotional may leave your partner feeling confused about why you are upset.Avoid making “you” statements such as, “You never,” “ You are not,” “ You need to,” etc. Instead, make “I” statements such as, “I feel,” “I think,” “I want,” etc. This is a general helpful approach that works for all people (not just autistic people).  , In order to understand your boyfriend’s perspective, it is important to listen and make your boyfriend feel heard. Make sure that you take the time to stop and listen to your boyfriend when he is speaking. Do not talk while he is speaking, just listen try to understand what he is saying before you respond., Validating the other person’s feelings or concerns means acknowledging them and not minimizing them. Even if you feel like your boyfriend’s perspective is flawed, you need to accept what he has said in order to keep the lines of communication open in your relationship.Seek to understand first, then respond. If you don't know why he feels a certain way, ask, and listen closely to his response. For example, instead of responding with something like “There is no reason to be angry about what happened last night.” Try saying something like, “I hear that you are angry about what happened last night.”  , Autistic people often struggle with low self-esteem, as they may be told that they are burdens because of their autism or associated unusual ""behaviors."" Offer him plenty of support and reassurance, especially on his bad days.    Encourage him to get help if he exhibits signs of depression or suicidal thoughts.  , Autism is a part of your boyfriend's experiences, personality, and life. This won't change. Love him unconditionally, autism and all.

"['surprise your spouse every once in a while', 'take good care of each other', 'compliment each other more', ""don't keep score""]",How to Spice up a Marriage2," When was the last time you gave your husband or wife a sweet, surprising gift? Maybe you both have everything you need, but it's nice to get a thoughtful gift every once in a while. It doesn't have to be expensive; just a little something to show your spouse you've been thinking of him or her and you're thankful to be married. Here are a few ideas for thoughtful gifts:   Cook your spouse's favorite dinner, and serve it with a nice bottle of wine. Buy your spouse something you've seen him or her eyeing online for awhile, or something he or she admired in a shop window. Flowers and chocolate are classic thoughtful gifts that everyone can appreciate. Surprise your spouse by doing his or her regular chores sometime. Clean up the bedroom, buy a few new throw pillows, and light some candles one evening when you're both staying in.  Plant your spouse's favorite flowers in front of the house. Throw a dinner party and invite your spouse's family and friends.  , Are you taking your spouse for granted in any way? Do you know what worries he or she has, or what needs aren't always being met? Go out of your way to ease your spouse's mind and make life a little easier for him or her. Try to get more in tune with how you can be a better husband or wife. This will strengthen your marriage and help it feel more satisfying.   Divide the household chores evenly. Don't be lazy and let your spouse do all the work. Are you doing your fair share? Take care of your spouse when he or she is sick or tired. Help him or her feel better in any way you can. Spend time discussing your spouse's worries. Is there any way you can help to solve the problems? You'll feel closer to one another if you can find a solution together.  , A few compliments can go a long way toward spicing up a marriage. Just make sure they're genuine! What do you truly appreciate about your spouse? Do you ever make a point of telling him or her? Now's the time to start expressing your appreciation and letting your spouse know you think he or she is the most wonderful person in the world.   The number of compliments and positive things you say to your spouse should greatly exceed the number of negative things you say. You don't have the right to cut your spouse down, and you should never insult him or her. Be accepting, and if it's necessary to say something negative, be gentle. Compliment your spouse in front of other people. Your spouse will feel great, and others will be impressed at how happy and sweet your marriage is. Never, ever criticize your spouse in front of other people; this can cause long-term damage.  , Tallying up how many times you took the kids to school this week, made dinner, did the dishes, and so on is a recipe for resentment. You and your spouse aren't opponents - you're a team! You're in this together, and you need to remind yourself of that sometimes. Don't get bogged down in keeping track of who does what chore.   Perform your responsibilities with a spirit of cheerfulness and generosity, rather than frowning and complaining all the time. Encourage your spouse to do the same. You'll find your days together become more fun that way. If the division of chores and other responsibilities in your marriage is truly unequal, that's a different story. If your spouse isn't doing any work at all, and you feel like you're running the household on your own, you might need marriage counseling.  ","['score', 'good care', 'spouse']"
"['verify that a cause for petition falls under your local government’s jurisdiction', 'find out how many signatures you need', 'learn how people must sign the petition for it to be valid', 'research your topic so you understand the various positions fully', 'consider which medium for circulating your petition is ideal', 'develop a very specific statement that identifies what you want people to support', 'make your petition brief', 'add body paragraphs supporting your first', 'declarative paragraph', 'read over your summary carefully', 'edit your petition for spelling and grammar errors', 'get someone else to read your petition', 'preferably a friend or relative who is uninformed about the situation', 'create a signer’s form on a separate sheet of paper', 'prepare the form using a spreadsheet program', 'photocopy or print multiple copies of your original', 'talk to people in person', 'use the power of e-mail', 'create an online presence for your petition', 'get media coverage', 'be polite']",How to Write a Petition," Contact the administrative office of your local government or check out your local government website. You might need to petition on a county or state level. Have the office direct you to the department that handles matters related to your cause. Then request petition guidelines.  , This is very important. It would be horrible to set a goal of 1,000 signatures, reach it, and then realize you need 2,000. Also look up whether or not your petition needs approval before being circulated.  , If you are trying to get a candidate's name added to the ballot, and the law says you must show an address for each name, ask your signers for this information.  , Researching your topic is also a good way to find out if someone has already started a petition about it.  , Regardless of your choice, you will still need to write the petition properly. (See below for more advice on this.) Paper petitions can be more effective for local petitions, but online petitions can reach broader networks much faster. Consider sites like ipetitions.com, Petitions24.com, or GoPetition.com, which offer a higher level of accountability than some competing petition sites. Facebook Causes can also be a great, accountable way to collect a large amount of online support for an issue. The details matter just as much for online petitions as for paper ones.   If your cause requires people to take action and not just agree to a position, consider collective action alternatives to petitions. For example, you could start a campaign on an online forum like The Point. Online forums and similar sites gather support in the same way a petition does, but they are centered around eventually taking an action to force a change---not just passively asking for it.  , It should be precise, concise, and informative.   Weak: We support more funding for a park. This sentence is far too general. What kind of park? How much funding? Strong: We demand that the Commissioners of Nature County allocate funds for a new park in the Adventure District. The precise details are clearly written in this sentence.  , People will be less likely to support you if they have to spend a great deal of time reading what you have to say. No matter how long your petition is, you must put your specific goal at the very beginning of the first paragraph. Then follow it up with your reason(s) for petitioning. This will be the paragraph that most people read.   Example of the first paragraph of a petition: We demand that the Commissioners of Nature County allocate funds for a new park in the Adventure District. This district does not have any parks. Our children need to have a place where they can experience nature and play outdoors.   , These paragraphs should contain information and specific examples showing the importance of what you are fighting for. Write as many body paragraphs as you like, but just be aware that most people you speak with on the street will not read all of them.  , Make sure it (1) describes the situation, (2) suggests what is needed, and (3) explains why it is needed. Is it clear? If you did not know about the situation, would you understand it by reading your petition?  , If errors litter your petition, it is very unlikely you will be taken seriously. Use spell check and proofread your petition for obvious mistakes. Read it out loud to determine whether or not it flows and makes sense.  , Does the person understand your goal? Can they tell why you're petitioning, what you're demanding, and why you're demanding it?  , Put the petition title on top. Your petition title should be concise but descriptive.   Example of petition title: Petition for New Park for Adventure District   , It will look much more professional and will be easier to change if need be. (See the sample template at the top of this page.) Divide the page into five columns labeled Name, Address, E-mail Address, Phone Number, and Signature. (In some cases and in some states, you may have to add a column for Voter Registration Number.) Allow plenty of room for the Address column. Add ten to 20 lines per page.   If you do not have a computer or a spreadsheet program, go to your local library, where a librarian or volunteer can help you use the library computers to make your petition. If this is not practical, use a ruler to divide a sheet of 8.5"" x 11"" or A4 paper into the five (or six) columns listed in the paragraph just above and follow the rest of the directions there.  , Make enough pages for the number of signatures you need. Number the pages so you can keep better track of them and the signatures you have. You may also want signature gatherers to initial the pages they have used or overseen so you can ask them any questions about what is written on a particular page. Initialing pages also increases overall accountability.  , Go where you can speak with large numbers of people concerned about the issue or open to information about it. Maybe the public needs to know about your petition, if so, write a speech. Go to the public place where the people you want to inform will be to listen. Make sure you have the permission first thing. If your petition is about a school, speak to people at or near the school. Spread the word about your petition through your office. Hang posters on community bulletin boards about your cause.  , Create an online version of your petition and send it to your family, friends, and acquaintances. Try not to flood them with e-mails, though---sending an e-mail every day for a month will not get you the results you want. Instead, follow up a first round of petitions with two or three reminders over the period when you are petitioning.  , Create a blog or online forum where you can discuss your petition and answer the questions of potential signers. Media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are great ways to get the word out and could help make a movement large enough to get a nationwide following . Good websites make it simple. They also notify the people you made your petition about when people sign it so they know what people think.  , Contact local media about your cause; try for a local radio station or newspaper first. As your petition gains momentum, so will the coverage.  , Nobody trying to get to work on time likes an angry petitioner in their face. Even if someone believes in your cause, they might not have the time or funds to support you at the moment. Don't take it personally! It's always better to be polite---they may contact you or help fund your cause when they have the time and resources.

"['don’t physically punish your dog', 'remove physical stimulants', 'consider clicker training to train your dog', 'reward the good behavior', 'tone down your behavior', 'build trust', 'have patience']",How to Stop a Dog's Unwanted Behavior2," If you have punished your dog more than three times for the same behavior, your punishment is not appropriate. Remember - the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results! Punishing your dog will damage your relationship with your dog and possibly make the problem worse. A punishment does not have to be physical. Find alternatives that don’t injure or scare your dog. Do not hit or hurt your dog in any way. This breeds vicious, scared dogs, not lovable, huggable pooches.   Never hit your dog. Just say ""No!"" firmly instead.Your dog will make the connection between his behavior and what you did to stop him., If there are certain objects, toys, and plants in your house or garden that appear to ""set off"" your dog, remove them. Give your dog a toy that it likes, that it will spend an hour playing with. Get a rawhide bone, a real bone, or a safe chew-toy. If there is some way to fill it with treats, your dog will spend even more time trying to get the treats out., Clicker training is a method of delivering immediate praise with the help of a clicker. You can click faster than you can give a treat or pet your dog's head. As such, clicker training reinforces good behavior fast enough for a dog's learning speed. It works by creating a positive association between the click sound and rewards. Eventually, your dog will consider the sound of the clicker itself reward enough for good behavior. You can apply the principle of clicker training to any dog command.Click the clicker device, then immediately give the dog a treat. This creates a positive association with the click sound. Later, that sound will “mark” a behavior as correct so the dog knows that he did something right.When the dog performs a desired behavior, make the click sound, then give him a treat. Once he's performing that behavior consistently, you can give the behavior a command name. Begin tying the command and the behavior together with the help of the clicker. For example, before you ever teach your dog the ""sit"" command, give the click sound, a treat, and praise when you find him sitting. When he begins sitting just to get the treats, start saying the word ""sit"" to get him into position. Pair it with the click sound to reward him. Eventually, he will learn that sitting in response to the ""sit"" command will earn him a click reward., When your dog does a behavior you do want, such as laying down instead of barking, reward him or her. He will be much more likely to repeat the desired behavior and less likely to repeat the ""bad"" behavior. When incentives for bad behavior are withdrawn and incentives for good behavior are introduced consistently, the dog will soon learn the preferred response., Try to stop yelling, cajoling, or responding in any manner that gives the dog signals that you are excited, playful, dog-focused. Whilst you may feel very irritated, even angry, the dog may misinterpret this for playfulness or ""joining in"". Resist the temptation. Ignoring and silence is better than yelling — clean the mess up later after you send the dog elsewhere.  , If your dog is running away from you and hiding, you have a lot of work to do to redevelop your damaged relationship with your dog. Your dog's trust in you has been damaged and it will take a lot of consistency and positive reinforcement training on your part to mend the broken relationship and turn it into something fabulous., Dogs are slow learners. Your dog doesn't have the same contemplative powers that a human does. He can’t learn from one situation and extrapolate for others. To fundamentally change a dog’s behavior requires time and attention. If you have adopted your dog as an older dog with habits that seem to be set in stone, relax. The habits are not set. Remember, dogs are very context specific and that works to our favor. The dog now has a new pack and a new home and if you set the limits and expectations immediately when the dog arrives at his new home, he will learn. Sometimes when you are dealing with a hardwired behavior like a border collie that is herding the neighborhood kids instead of sheep, you cannot easily counter train that out. It is so much easier to manage the situation, rather than try to train him out of it. How quickly a bad behavior stops depends on how well established it is. If the problem is an ingrained habit, then it can be difficult to break the association between action and reward. In fact, in the short or medium term the bad behavior can get worse because the dog works even harder to try and get the reward.","['patience', 'trust', 'physical stimulants', 'behavior', 'good behavior', 'dog', 'clicker training']"

Once the cards have been dealt, the rules cannot be changed.; , Someone can volunteer to be dealer or you can select one randomly.   Don't look at the cards you've been dealt! If anyone does, shuffle the cards again and re-deal. If you play multiple rounds, take turns as the dealer, going clockwise. The dealer should give himself the same number of cards.  , Place the remainder of the deck in a face down stack to from the draw pile.

Make sure everyone knows the goal of the game is to get the lowest score, not the highest!  , If possible this should be someone who has played the game before, so the new players can learn by watching them.   After that player is finished, play continues clockwise, each player taking a turn in order.  , You can take the top card of the discard pile if you think it will be useful. Otherwise, draw a card from the top of the draw pile (the rest of the deck).   Read the rest of these rules or see Strategy to help you make this decision.  , You can replace any card, whether it's face up or face down.   Pick up the card you want to replace from your grid and put it face up in the discard pile. Place the newly drawn card face up in its place. You cannot shift the position of your grid around before you do this. If you don't like the card you just drew, you can discard it face up in the discard pile instead of replacing a card in your grid. You cannot do this if the card you drew just came from the discard pile.  , If the two cards in a column share the same number or letter (for instance, a Queen above another Queen), they cancel each other out and are worth nothing (zero points).   Remember, you're trying to get the lowest score possible! If you like, you can take columns that have canceled out and place them on the bottom of the discard pile (NOT the top). This makes the table less cluttered.  , Once someone replaces their last face down card, each other player turns their grid face up as well and takes one final turn in clockwise order.  , Wait until the last player takes their turn, then flip every card in front of you face up.   Use a sheet of paper with each player's name on it to record their score for the round. Refer to the scoring guide to count up players' points.

The person sitting left of the current dealer always goes first in a round. Keep score after each round until:  You play 9 rounds, 18 rounds, or some other number everyone agrees on. The traditional numbers of rounds are named after the golf theme and sometimes called ""holes"" instead of rounds. A player reaches 100 points, 200 points, or some other number everyone agrees on.

If you're playing with young kids or other people who have trouble memorizing cards, see the ""4 cards in hand"" Variation or try using the 6-card rules instead.  , See the Scoring Guide for a common system, or use a variation. Write or print it out for people who haven't played before.   The goal of the game is to get the lowest score. Make sure no one is trying to ""win"" by getting the highest instead!  , This can be from the discard pile or draw pile (rest of the deck).   Read the rest of these rules or see Strategy to help you make this decision. Hold this card in your hand. If it came from the face down draw pile, don't let anyone else see it.  , You can replace any card, whether it's one you've peeked at or not.   Pick up the card you want to replace from your grid and put it face up in the discard pile. Place the card you just drew face down to fill the empty space in your grid. You may not move the cards in the grid to different positions. Remember to memorize the card you just put down! This variation tests your memory, so you are not allowed to peek at a card after the beginning of the game. If you don't like the card you just drew, you can discard it face up in the discard pile instead of replacing a card in your grid. You CANNOT do this if the card you drew just came from the discard pile.  , A pair of the same card in a row or column are worth zero points. Don't show the other players or turn any cards face up to ""cancel"", though. They remain a face down secret until the end of the game.   If you have three of a kind, only two of them will cancel out. The third will still be worth its usual value. If you have four of a kind, your entire grid is worth zero points.  , Instead of taking your normal turn, anyone can knock on the table to signify that they think they'll win. That player skips their turn, and each other player takes one final turn. Then the round ends.

If you don't have Jokers, instead designate a specific card the ""bonus card"" (usually Twos or ""one eyed Jacks"").   The Joker or bonus card is worth -2 (negative two) points instead of its usual value. A pair of Jokers or bonus cards cancel each other out just like normal pairs, increasing your score from -4 to 0.  , This optional rule punishes players who try to end the game too early, and rewards players who correctly guess when they're ahead. Here are a couple variations.   The player who ends the game (by ""knocking"" or by flipping their last card face up) gains 10 points if they do not have the lowest score this round. If the player who ended the game does not have the lowest score this round, that player gains a number of points equal to the player who did.  For example, Scrooge ""knocks"". After each player takes their final turn and counts up their score, Scrooge has 17 points and Marley has 12. Because Scrooge didn't win the round by getting the lowest score, Scrooge is punished for knocking and adds Marley's 12 points to his own. The final scores are Scrooge 29 and Marley 12.    , Follow the rules for 6-card golf, but give each player a 4x2 or 5x2 grid.   This will make the game quite a bit longer and may require an additional deck of cards shuffled with the other(s).  , Follow the rules for 4-card golf, but give each player a hand of four cards instead of a grid.   Players can look at all cards in their hand at any time. Any two cards in hand cancel out if they have the same value. There is no ""grid position"" in your hand. This creates a short simple game with no need to memorize cards.  , Follow the rules for 6-card golf, but give each player a 3x3 grid.   Each player turns up 3 cards instead of 2 at the start of the game. A player can only cancel cards by getting 3 of a kind in the same row or column. When they do, they can remove those 3 cards and place them at the bottom (NOT the top) of the discard pile. This will make the game quite a bit longer and may require an additional deck of cards shuffled with the other(s).  , There are many different ways to play 6-card golf, and different families and gaming groups will have their own rules. Here are some common ones:   When you flip over your first two cards, they have to be in the same column, or they must be in different columns.Two of the same card anywhere on the layout cancel out, not just in the same column. This makes the game easier for younger players or beginners.If you have two columns next to each other with FOUR of the same card in them, they cancel out to zero points AND each other player gets 10 points added to their score this round.Players can only draw from the top of the draw pile during the final turns, not the discard pile.  , Again, there are many ways to play. Here are some common additions or changes to the rules:   You can only peek at the two cards closest to you. Pairs across from each other diagonally also cancel out. Pairs don't cancel out at all. The only goal is to take the lowest cards and try to end the game when you think you're ahead. Players can only draw from the top of the draw pile during the final turns.  , If you're playing a variation that allows you to start with face up cards, choose cards in different columns. This gives you more chances to ""cancel"" out a column.  , Unless you can cancel out your high scoring cards, you want to get rid of them so they don't add their high values to your score.   This is especially important as the game draws to a close. If your opponent is almost out of face down cards (or is looking smug), toss out your liabilities as quickly as possible!  , Much of the strategy in Golf comes down to paying attention to the other players.If the player to your right is picking up Sixes, you should give up trying to cancel your own Sixes. They aren't likely to discard any. If the player to your left is trying to finish a column of Nines, try to avoid discarding your own Nine.

The box should be well-insulated, since the ducklings need to stay warm. Don't choose a box with too many holes in the sides or the bottom. Line the bottom of the box with wood shavings or old towels. Avoid using newspaper or other slippery material. Ducklings are still wobbly on their legs for the first few weeks after they hatch, and they can slip easily and hurt themselves on surfaces like plastic or newspaper.; , Baby ducks need to be kept very warm in the first few weeks after they hatch, to give them the chance to get used to the chilly air outside their eggs. Buy a brooding lamp at a feed store or hardware store and affix it to the top of the brooder.   Use a 100-watt bulb to start. For very young ducklings, this should create the right amount of heat. Make sure part of the brooder is located away from the heat, so they have a place to cool off if they need to. Make sure the bulb isn't too close to the ducklings. This may cause them to overheat, or if they touch the bulb, they could get burned. If you're using a shallow brooder, prop the lamp up higher using blocks of wood or another sturdy prop  , Periodically check the lamp’s placement, ensuring that the ducklings are getting an appropriate amount of warmth.   The heat and wattage of the lamp should be altered based on your ducklings' behavior as they get older. If the ducklings tend to huddle close together under the lamp, they may be too cold and you should move the lamp closer or get a higher wattage bulb. If the ducklings are scattered out and breathing heavily, they're most likely getting overheated, and you need to move the lamp further away or use a lower wattage bulb. Comfortable ducklings should be warm and settled.  , As the ducks grow older, they will need less heat. Raise the lamp or change the bulb to a lower heat when they stop sleeping under it.  , Put a shallow drinking bowl inside the brooder that is deep enough for the ducklings to dip in their beaks, but not their entire heads.Ducklings like to be able to clear their nostrils as they drink, but if you give them access to deeper water they could climb in and drown.Change the water and clean the bowl every day to make sure the ducklings don't get sick from drinking dirty water. If you fear the bowl you have is a little too deep for your ducklings to drink from safely, lining the bottom with pebbles or marbles will make it safer for them., Ducklings don't eat for the first twenty-four hours after they hatch, since they're still absorbing nutrients from the yolk inside the egg they hatched from. After that, they graduate to starter crumbs, tiny pellets of duck food available at feed supply stores.Buy a plastic feeder, fill it up, and place it in the brooder.   If the ducklings seem hesitant to eat, try adding a little water to their food to make it easier for them to swallow. You can also add a very small amount of sugar to their water for the first couple of days to help them get off to a good start and give them energy.  , Very weak ducklings may need a little extra yolk nutrition before they're ready for starter crumbs. Feed them a bit of mashed duck egg yolk until they become more interested in the starter crumbs.  , Make sure the ducklings have access to food 24/7. They need to be able to eat whenever they're hungry since they grow so quickly at this stage of life. They also need water to help them swallow their food, so keep the water bowl full at all times.   After about ten days, ducklings are ready for grower's pellets, which are the same as the starter crumbs, only bigger.  , When the ducklings become adults, after about 16 weeks, they're ready for adult duck food.  , Many foods humans eat, like bread, don't provide them with the nutrition that ducks need, and some can even make them sick.Even if the ducks are interested in food such as bread, it is not good for them. Ducks can have very thinly cut fruits and vegetables as a snack, but make sure their main meal is duck food. Don't give ducklings food made for baby chickens. It doesn't have the right nutrient makeup for ducklings. Never use medicated feed for ducklings. It can cause organ damage.  , Ducks love to swim, and they'll start as soon as the first day after they hatch if you let them. Do not let them swim unattended. Baby ducks are covered with down, which isn't waterproof, and their bodies are still too fragile to cope with swimming alone at this stage., The paint roller tray makes a great environment for starter swimming.You can supervise them closely, and the slope in the tray creates a little ramp to help the ducklings get in and out safely.   Don't let the ducklings swim too long, or they'll get chilled. When they're done swimming, dry them off gently and place them back in the brooder so they can warm up. You can also let them sit on a heating pad covered with a clean towel for a few minutes.  , When ducklings are fully feathered with their waterproof, adult feathers, they can swim without your supervision. Depending on the type of duck, full feathers should be in place by 9-12 weeks of age.  , Make sure the ducklings are supervised at all times while they're still growing their adult feathers and learning to swim, particularly if letting young ducks swim in an outdoor pond. Older adult ducks that may share the same pond or water source may try to drown or kill the younger ducks.  , Ducks, particularly when young, can be targets for predatory animals. You can free range your ducks when they are adults, but remember you may lose ducks occasionally to predators. You should make every effort to keep them safe from predators.   If you're raising ducklings in a garage or barn outside, make sure no other animals can get near them. Wolves, foxes, and even large predatory birds could harm your ducklings if you aren't careful. Ducklings raised inside your home need to be kept safe from dogs and cats, which may try to attack or even play too roughly with the ducklings. Once the ducklings move from the brooder to a larger pen, make sure there's no way for predators to get in.  , It's tempting to cuddle with the sweet, fuzzy ducklings, but if you get too close to the ducklings, they might imprint on you too strongly. To make sure your ducklings grow up into an independent, healthy adults, enjoy watching them play with each other, but don't join in the fun too much.  , Once the ducks are too big for the brooder, move them to a large dog kennel or a shed with a latching door. Feed them adult duck feed and let them spend their days swimming and splashing in a pond. Make sure to bring them back into their shelter at night to keep them safe from predators.

The bands should be thick enough and tight enough to lead to castration within a few weeks.   Store your castration bands in the refrigerator until they are ready for use. This will keep the rubber from breaking down. Always check the rubber ring for elasticity/ breakage before applying it, simply put it on the tool and squeeze the handles to stretch the rubber ring. It should not break/ rip and be free of any cracks.  , You will need some antiseptic spray in case of infection. Take your goat kid to the veterinarian at the first sign of an infection.  , They reach sexual maturity at this time and can begin impregnating your doe (female goats). An uncastrated male goat is called a “buck.”   Make sure both testes have descended before you band your goat. You can have short-scrotum goats if a testis is pushed into the belly cavity.  , Banding is painful to the goat, so administering anti-inflammatories can reduce discomfort. To reduce pain further, you can administer lidocaine to numb the area during the banding period.,,, Set the kid in your helpers lap, so that his belly is up and his front hooves are restrained.  , Squeeze the elastrator handles to expand the band.  , Move the handle of the elastrator closer to the base of the scrotum.  , If you are right handed, put the tool aside for a minute, with your left hand hold the scrotum and feel if both testicles are inside. If not, don't let go, still holding with your left hand, reach with your right hand to the goats belly close to the scrotum, they tend to hold the testicles in sometimes, find them under the skin and push towards the scrotum ""catching"" them with your left hand. Once you can feel both testicles inside you can put the rubber ring on. Still holding the testicles with your left hand, squeeze the tools handles, pushing scrotum through the open rubber ring, carefully place it where you want it to be, close slightly so that they don't escape again, and with left hands fingers help push down the rubber ring from the first two metal ring expanders and then remove it completely. Check for proper placement again. Leave them loose, putting the ring a bit closer to the body. Otherwise it will be very painful for the animal and you will have to redo it. Also, make sure that the nipples are outside of the band., Keep it sterilized to avoid infection.  , Don’t wait until the constriction starts to take place. If a nipple is inside the rubber band or a testis is pushed up, you should replace the band correctly. , Spray with antiseptic if the area looks too inflamed. Administer pain relief beforehand, since this will be painful for the goat.  , The scrotum will start to shrivel.

"['know the parts of the equation', 'surface area = 4πr2', 'find the radius of the sphere', 'square the radius by multiplying it by itself', 'multiply this result by 4', 'multiply the results by pi (π)', 'remember to add you units to the final answer', 'practice with an example', 'understand surface area']",How to Find the Surface Area of a Sphere," This nearly ancient formula is still the easiest way to determine the surface area of a sphere. Using almost any calculator, you can plug in the radius to get the surface area of your sphere.    r, or ""radius: The radius is the distance from the center of the sphere to the edge of that sphere.  π, or ""pi:"" This incredible number (equalling roughly 3.14) represents the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter, and is useful in all equations with circles and spheres. It is commonly shortened as π = 3.1416, but there are an infinite number of decimals.4: For somewhat complex reasons, the surface area of a sphere is always 4 times as large as the area of a circle with the same radius.; , Sometimes your problem will supply you the radius, and other times you will have to find it yourself. If you are given the diameter of a circle, simply divide the diameter by 2 to get the radius. For example, a sphere of diameter 10 inches has a radius of 5 inches.    Advanced Tip:If you only know the volume of a sphere, you need to do a little more work to get the radius. Divide the volume by 4π, then multiply that answer by 3. Finally, take the cube root of this answer.  , You can either do this by manually multiplying (52 = 5 * 5 = 25) or by using your calculator's ""square"" function (sometimes labeled as ""x2"").  , While you can multiply either 4 or pi first, it is generally easier to start with 4 since there are no decimals to multiply yet.   If our radius is 5, like above, you would be left with 4 * 25 * π, or 100π.  , If your problem says ""exact value"", write the symbol π after your number and call it done. Otherwise, use the approximation π=3.14 or your calculator's π button.   100 * π = 100 * 3.14 100π = 314  , Is your sphere's surface area 314 inches big, or 314 miles big? The units need to be written as ""units2,"" because this denotes area, otherwise known as ""square units""   The full answer to the sphere in the pictures is: Surface Area = 314 units2. The units you use are always the same ones used to measure the radius. If the radius is in meters, the answer will be in meters.  Advanced Tip: We square the units because area measures how many flat squares we could fit on the surface of the sphere. Say we measure the practice problem in inches. This means on a sphere where r=5, we could fit 314 squares on the surface of the sphere if the sides of every square are 1 inch long.  , If the radius of a sphere is 7 centimeters, what is the surface area of that sphere?   4πr2  r = 7 4 * π * 72  49 * 4 * π 196π  Answer: Surface Area = 615.75 centimeters2, or 615.75 square centimeters.  , The surface area of a sphere is the area covering the outside of the sphere -- think of it as the rubber covering a kickball or the surface of the earth. Because it is curved, it is much harder to measure the surface area of a sphere than a box, so we need an equation to determine the area.   Rotating a circle around it's axis (the center point) will produce a sphere. Think of spinning a coin on the table and how it appears to form a sphere. While it won't be explained here, this is where our equation comes from.  Advanced Tip: Spheres have a smaller surface area per volume than any other shape -- that means it can hold more things in a smaller area than any other shape.

Rather than drawing attention to a particular article of clothing, as you might normally, try to mesh the patterns you choose.For example, you might make an outfit:   Floral themed Polka dotted Subtly pinstriped Gingham themed  , When coordinating so many different styles and patterns, balance can be difficult. Try to keep any one part of your outfit from being too busy pattern-wise than the rest of it. In boho styles, the eye should be naturally drawn to the face as the central feature of the outfit., Many secondhand stores have a surplus of clothing from this period, and here you might find out peasant blouses and maxi skirts that you can use in your bohemian style.The heavy influence of hippy style on clothing from this time period makes it ideal for boho fashion.   You might also visit garage/yard sales and estate auctions to find these articles of clothing. Modern versions of these creations can sometimes be found in specialty shops.  , The origins of the bohemian people, the Roma, are theorized to be on the Indian subcontinent.Over the course of the Roma people's migration to central Europe, many bold patterns and styles, like those you might see worn in parts of Africa or India, were adopted.   Pair these patterns with different patterns without giving too much weight to clash. If outfit cohesion is important to you, you might choose a theme, like floral patterns or simple geometric designs, like polka dots and stripes. Be sure you give contrasting colors and patterns a try. You never know when two seemingly opposing patterns will bring out the bohemian in you!  , Too many dangling ends or busy patterns at the bottom of your outfit might draw attention away from your face; the bohemian style begins at the face and then travels to the rest of the body.Make use of layers to sweep around less flattering parts of your body, as you might by flaring bottom layers to offset square shoulders.  , The base layer in boho style is often thin and relatively well fitting when compared to outer layers. Many wearers of boho style begin layering with a spaghetti top, bra top, a vest, or stretch t-shirt.These more fitted base layers will allow to add more layers on top without appearing swaddled. Over top, you might add:   A knit cardigan A loose-fit tunic A kaftan A fitted vest, The simple garments often associated with central European peasantry have long been a staple in boho style.Rough spun garments can simulate this appearance, but you should also consider:   Cheesecloth skirts Linen skirts Maxi skirts Leggings Flared jeans, Plainer boho dresses and fabrics can be brought to life with spangles and faux jewels. Large, chunky, earth toned jewelry can create a richer look for even the plainest seeming boho item. Some options include:   Metal bangles Wooden wrist cuffs Glass bead necklace Long dangling earrings, Or, you might make use of modern accessories that are fashioned in vintage designs. Some examples of this might include turquoise bracelets, aged lockets, and ornate pendants. Combine these accessories in layers by using various lengths, like you might when wearing a long, medium length, and short length necklaces., The artistic and frequently hand-worked design of most artisan crafts can bring an air of Bohemia to even everyday outfits. Look for items that are nature themed, or crafted with natural products, like:   Worked leather Natural metals (like copper) Glass beads Stones (like quartz and onyx)  , While fur cuffed shoes might be a little outside your price range, boots adorned with faux fur can improve the natural appeal of your outfit.Leather and suede are in line with the naturalist philosophy of boho, so these are also options you should keep in mind. Other footwear to consider:   Ankle boots Flat sandals Gladiator sandals, You might consider including an earth tone scarf in your bohemian braid.Another popular look uses a bandanna around the crown of your head to frame hair done in a simple updo.These looks will make you fit right in with the boho crowd.

When you walk your dog, watch for obstacles that may cause your dog to trip and gently redirect your dog as needed.   Using a back or front clip harness rather than a leash may give you a little more control over your dog and make it easier for you to guide him around obstacles.Also, keep in mind that your dog will need reassurance if something noisy startles him. Pay attention to your surroundings and talk to your dog to let him know everything is okay. When you are out walking with your dog, do not let your blind dog get near strange dogs or people, especially children. Blind dogs may nip in defense if they become startled.; , To train a dog to respond to verbal cues, you need to be consistent and always offer a reward when your dog responds to the cue. For example, to teach your dog to sit with the “sit” command, you would need to practice telling your dog to sit a few times every day. After each time that your dog responds to the cue by sitting, you would give your dog a treat and some praise.Make sure that you offer the treat and praise right away. For example, you would need to give your dog his treat right after your dog’s bottom hits the floor so that he will make the connection that this is a good thing to do. Keep training sessions short to help your dog stay focused. Dogs have short attention spans, so it is best to keep training sessions under 10 minutes. End on a positive note. If your dog starts to get impatient, give him a command that he has already mastered, such as “sit,” then reward him with a treat and some praise and end the session.  , Your dog can still feel and he will likely use his sense of touch to figure out how to get around the house.You can use your dog's sense of touch to help train him as well.. To use touch in training sessions, you can do things like using the leash to steer your dog in the direction that you want him to go or applying gentle pressure to his body to get him to complete a command.   For example, if you are teaching your dog the ""sit"" command, you might place one hand on his behind and apply gentle pressure to help him understand what you are asking him to do.  , Most dogs will see an upcoming corner while riding in a car and brace themselves so they don’t fall over. A blind dog cannot use that visual clue, so saying “corner” before a turn will help the dog associate the word with turning a corner. After repeating this cue several times, your dog will learn to brace himself.  , A blind dog cannot see objects or obstacles that may cause him to fall or bump his head. To help your dog navigate the world around him, say “watch” whenever something is in his way and redirect him by applying gentle pressure to his leash.After a while he will associate the command with a need to turn or change course.  , Blind dogs cannot see when there is a step or curb that they need to go up or down, which may cause them to fall. Whenever you encounter a step or curb, say “step” just before your dog reaches it.Then, try stopping him and place one of his paws on the edge of the step to help guide him up or down the step. Repeat the command as you do this.   Doing this will help your dog to understand what he needs to do when he hears one of these commands.  , If you have just gotten a blind dog or if your dog has just been diagnosed with blindness, then you may find it helpful to meet with a dog trainer and get some specialized help. A dog trainer can help you to find what motivates your dog and teach him commands that will make life easier for your dog.

When you’re shopping for rice be sure to get one of the kinds that is not long-grain.Although it’s not impossible to use long-grain, it will not work as well as the shorter ones.; , Use a colander style sieve with holes that are small enough that the rice won’t fall through. Follow the instructions on the package of rice to measure out the amount you want to cook.If you use a rice cooker measuring cup, remember it is probably not a standard U.S. cup (237 ml). The package of rice and the rice cooker are likely to have different instructions for measuring the rice. Since the rice cooker is designed specifically, follow its directions over the rice package. Remember that rice expands as it cooks, so one uncooked cup of rice might be close to two cooked cups of rice.  , Grab a regular bowl, or basin of any kind, and set it under your faucet in the sink. As water strains through the rice and falls into the bowl, you’ll be able to gauge when the rice is completely rinsed.  , Turn the faucet on cold and begin to rinse the rice. This is necessary because packaged rice has lots of powdery starch in it. The rice needs to be washed completely so that it cooks up properly and doesn’t become too gooey.Cold water works best so that the rice doesn’t start cooking while you wash it. If you want to conserve water, just fill the bowl and set the sieve down into it. The rice won’t get as clean this way, but it will still rinse off most of the powder.  , Use your hands to gently massage and stir the rice so that each grain gets rinsed completely. Don’t press or squeeze the rice, as this will break the grains. As you rinse the rice, watch how the water in the bowl turns hazy from the powder.As you stir, look for any foreign objects that may have ended up in the rice. Most rice won’t have an excessive amount of non-rice, but it’s always good to check.  , When the water in the bowl is clear and not hazy, the rice is completely rinsed. Turn the water off and empty the bowl of rinse water., Set out a cookie sheet or some wax paper and pour the rice out on it. Spread it around with your hand so it forms a single layer and is not piled up. Leave the rice sitting to dry for about 15 minutes.If you are in a hurry, it’s not absolutely necessary to dry the rice, but it helps it cook better.  , Scoop the rice into a pile and begin transferring it from the drying surface into the rice cooker. Be sure you haven’t measured out more rice than your rice cooker can handle at one time. If any rice sticks to the sides, brush it down with the rest., If you used a standard U.S. measuring cup to measure the rice, rice preparation instructions typically call for an equal amount of water. If you used a cup that came with the rice cooker, follow the rice cooker directions for how much water to use.Rice cookers often have water fill lines, so if you used one rice cooker cup of rice, you’d fill to the line marked “1.” Never guess how much water the rice needs. Either follow the rice package instructions or follow the rice cooker instructions.  , Each rice cooker is different, but it is best to fill it with the rice and water before you plug it in. Otherwise it might start cooking before you are ready. If your rice cooker has multiple settings, consult the user manual. It may even have a setting for cooking sushi rice.   Be sure to set the rice cooker on a sturdy surface. Keep other objects away as heating elements always present a potential hazard.  , Close the lid on the rice cooker and leave it to cook the rice. You don’t need to stir the rice while it cooks, but pay attention to how long it needs to cook. This is determined more by the model of rice cooker you have than by anything else.   Your rice cooker may have a timer or an automatic shut-off, but if not, be sure to set a timer as directed by the rice package or the rice cooker instructions. Rice will overcook if you leave it in for too long.  , In a small bowl, combine ½ cup (118 ml) of rice vinegar (not any other kind of vinegar), two tablespoons (30 ml) of sugar, and two teaspoons (9.9 ml) of salt. Stir until the dry ingredients dissolve.These proportions are for three uncooked cups (710 ml) of rice. Adjust the proportions as needed for smaller or larger batches of rice. Seasoning comes down to preference, so you may want a stronger or weaker taste. If you don’t want to mix it yourself, look for bottled “Sushi Vinegar” at the grocery store.  , Scoop the rice out of the rice cooker into a large bowl. Pour the seasoning evenly over the rice. You may even want to add just a little of the seasoning at a time, mix it thoroughly, and taste it. Add more seasoning to your preference.  , Using a rice paddle or wide spatula, stir the rice gently so that the vinegar mixture coats every grain as evenly as possible. Mix for a few minutes to distribute it. As you mix the sushi rice, don’t smash the rice and try not to break the grains.,","['hands', 'water', 'large bowl', 'sieve', 'rice cooker', 'bowl', 'cold water', 'rice vinegar', 'amount', 'seasoning', 'short-grain', 'salt', 'sink', 'rice', 'sushi rice']"

As a lightweight fabric that drapes well, chiffon adds elegance and shape to the otherwise boxy cut of the palazzo style.   You may even have trouble if you want to find chiffon pants cut to any other form. Chiffon is a material that doesn't have much structure on its own, so it is ill-suited for clothing meant to give shape and form to your body. Wide-leg palazzo pants, on the other hand, have very little shape and can take full advantage of the breezy, easy-going sophistication of chiffon.; , As with any garment, you need to make sure that the pants fit you properly. The surest way to verify an accurate fit is to try the pants on and take a good look at your legs in a full length mirror.   Chiffon pants are sized like any other style of trouser, so start by selecting a pair in your usual size. If they fit correctly, the pants should fit snugly around your natural waist (the thinnest part of your mid-section) and drape down over the entire length of your leg, falling out around the ankle. The wide leg should not hug the curves of your leg too closely, so if you see any stretching down the length of the leg, that particular pair of pants might be too small.  , Before you buy a pair of chiffon pants or wear them around town, you should look at yourself in a full length mirror under bright light. Since chiffon is so light, it also tends to be see-through. Looking at yourself under a bright light will let you see how much can be viewed through the material.   Most clothing manufacturers take appropriate measures to allow you to show off your legs without showing off your unmentionables. Chiffon pants usually have a second short, inner layer near the top that covers the hip and upper thigh area. Nonetheless, the wrong pair of chiffon pants can still produce a visible panty line, so checking the appearance is a good idea. It's also best to wear white or nude colored undergarments beneath the chiffon pants since bright or dark colors can easily show through.  , Chiffon pants come in a wide range of colors and prints. When shopping for your first pair, you should think about where you plan to wear the pants and what you want them to say about your personal style.   If you want to ease your way into the style, consider white or black chiffon pants. White pants can look both casual and dressy depending on what you wear them with, so they'll offer you the most versatility. Black chiffon pants are a little more difficult to dress down, but they can create a look ranging between sexy and elegant. For the more adventurous fashionistas, consider a pair of chiffon pants in a bright color or a bold print. You can find chiffon palazzo pants in colors like fire engine red and patterns like leopard print., Chiffon palazzo pants naturally elongate the appearance of your legs. To get the most benefit from this effect, wear high-waist tops or cropped tops that allow the full length of the pants to remain visible.   Try to look for a cropped top that lands directly at your natural waist—the skinniest part of your mid-section. Another high-waist option that works well with chiffon pants is the tie-front blouse., If the top you plan to wear with your chiffon pants extends a little further than desired, consider tucking it in. Doing so still raises the position of your visible waist, making your legs look even longer as a result.   Tucking your shirt in also draws the material closer to your body, which highlights and flatters your figure, too.  , Since chiffon pants have a loose, flowing appearance, you should balance it out by wearing tops that are more structured and form-fitting.   Tank tops and other form-fitting sleeveless shirts are great for this purpose since they add as little bulk to the top of your body as possible and show off your curves. If you're feeling especially daring, you could even try wearing a body suit. The lower half will be masked by the chiffon pants, leaving only the upper half visible.  , Layered tops are a good way to add visual interest and structure to the top half of your body in a way that balances out the loose structure of the chiffon pants. When layering your tops, however, you should make sure that the layers are slim instead of bulky.   For example, you could wear a tank top and slip an open vest or sleeveless button-down shirt over it. As long as both pieces are cut close to the body, they won't add too much weight to the top of your overall ensemble. To create something a little more professional in appearance, slip a cropped blazer over a simple tank top or form-fitting blouse.  , Chiffon pants are definitely a unique fashion trend, so they tend to demand attention no matter what you pair them with. A good way to keep your outfit looking sophisticated and well put together is to pair this temporary fashion fad with a simple top cut in a timeless style.   Consider wearing a simple black tank top with white chiffon pants for an effortlessly elegant look. If you want to try for something a little more sultry, choose a black, red, or metallic-tone tank top with a low, strappy back., White chiffon palazzo pants have a very breezy, easy-going appearance. Pairing them with a plain white top creates an overall look that screams “summer at the beach.”The top doesn't necessarily need to be solid white, either. If you want to create this look with a blouse that has more detail, though, you should gravitate toward those that blend white with other neutral colors like black, tan, gray, or brown. A white and navy blue top could work, too.  , Chiffon pants can look elegant or easy-going depending on what you wear them with. Dress the pants down by matching them with a plain form-fitting t-shirt.   You should still pay attention to the “high waist” rule even when you pair these pants with a t-shirt. Choose a cropped t-shirt or tuck a longer t-shirt in. Plain colors are often best if you want to create a style that is both classic and casual.  , If you want to wear chiffon pants to the office or to a party, you can make them look more elegant by matching them with a nice blouse. Keep the style of the blouse fairly simple so that it does not clash or compete with the pants.   Nearly any blouse that follows the ""form-fitting"" and ""high-waist"" rule can work well with chiffon palazzo pants. The right chambray or similar button-down shirt can make the chiffon pants appropriate to wear to the office during an ""business casual"" dress day., High heels elongate the leg no matter what you choose to wear them with. As such, they are the perfect footwear to slip on when you wear chiffon pants, which also elongate the leg.   The heel style should vary based on the tone of the overall outfit. Classic pumps are great for more formal styles while wedges and sandals work better for casual or beach-inspired looks.  , A statement necklace or statement earrings work best. Placing the extra amount of detail around your face encourages onlooking eyes to look both up and down your ensemble.   Rings and bracelets, on the other hand, will cause the eye to drop to your sides whenever you lower your arms. This draws too much attention to your lower half and may make your look appear unbalanced.  , If you choose to carry a handbag, you should choose something that matches both the tone and color of your outfit. Since a purse spends a lot of time around your leg area, sticking with a simple style is a good way to avoid choosing anything that clashes or competes for attention with your chiffon pants.   Consider a simple clutch when you want to create a more formal look. Larger purses can work well for a casual day out, for an informal dinner or lunch, or with business casual attire. Bucket totes are great when you want to wear chiffon pants to the beach or to a similarly mellow setting.  , You'll want to look good from head to toe, but with a piece as eye-catching as chiffon pants, you'll need to spend a little extra time on your makeup if you want your pretty face to draw just as much attention.   As a general rule, you should focus on either your eyes or your lips instead of applying heavy makeup to both. If you wear a bright red lipstick, keep your eye makeup more subdued. If you opt for a dramatic shadowy look for your eyes, opt for a lipstick color that's closer to your natural lip color. The occasion and tone of the overall outfit can make a difference, too. Casual daytime looks tend to work best with light makeup, but you can apply more dramatic makeup when working with sophisticated evening styles.

There are also online indexes that Reiki teachers and learning institutions by location and area. Try consulting a comprehensive online index to find a Reiki teacher and healer near you.There are many reiki blogs that often reference specific classes or are run by teacher themselves. Consult many blogs to have as many options as possible.Look for websites associated with alternative healing centers. Many of these websites can also have information on how and where to find reiki teachers and classes.; , Asking for personal recommendations will allow you to get an honest and trustworthy opinion of other teachers and healers. Ask any friends you have that see a healer or are enrolled in classes about their experience and for any advice they might have.   If you are currently seeking a Reiki healer for treatment, ask them if they offer classes or if they can recommend a teacher. Try asking questions like “What has your experience been like with this teacher?” “Do you feel like you are increasing your understanding?” “Are you enjoying learning from this person?”  , Reiki is not often listed in the Yellow Pages, but the Yellow Pages does list many other healers who may also practice Reiki. Contacting other healers and asking if they teach Reiki, offer classes, or can provide other resources and information will put you on your way to finding a teacher.Look for other healing categories in the Yellow Pages, like massage, herbology, chiropractic care, traditional chinese medicine, or hypnotherapy., Ask your potential teacher how often they practice, if they continue to heal others, and how they see those they are healing (remote or in-person). The more comprehensive information you have about your teacher the better you will be able to gauge your teacher’s experience and commitment to their practice.Reiki takes years to master. Look for teachers who have been practicing for a long time and show a dedicated daily commitment to both teaching and healing. Ask questions like “How long have you been practicing Reiki?” “How long have you been offering healing to others?” or “Which lineage did you learn under?”  , A Reiki teacher will be your partner throughout your journey learning how to practice and heal others. Teachers who assist your lifestyle, by leaving your decisions and lifestyle choices up to you, will give you the space and time to become your own Reiki teacher.Assistance means giving encouragement and advice while providing informative and helpful resources. Ask about the teacher's take on spirituality. Some Reiki Masters are interested in Reiki as a spiritual path while others are not. Avoid teachers who demonstrate controlling or interfering behaviors, like demanding lifestyle changes, isolation, or ideological worldviews. Learning Reiki should be about self-exploration, not self-exploitation.  , Many teachers become teachers through the desire to heal themselves. Self-healing can also be a sign of experienced teachers. Remember that your teacher will be your partner throughout your time learning to be a healer. A teacher that has healed themselves can often provide insight the inter- and intra-personal exploration that takes place when learning to heal.Some teachers, particularly those who are inexperienced, who have healed themselves can be emotionally triggered while teaching. Be sure to look for teachers with years of experience.  , Some teachers have taught hundreds of students and yet those they've taught would never see fit to recommend them. Others have taught but a few, yet they are excellent teachers. Looking at your potential teacher’s experience will help you select a teacher with your desired qualifications.]   Ask you teacher questions, like “How long have you been teaching?” “Do you take students regularly?” or “How many students have you taught in your career?” Get in touch with previous students that your potential teacher has taught. Ask them about their time with this particular teacher, if there are things to be wary of, what their experience was like, and if they would recommend them to others.  , Some teachers tend to rush their students to the next level even if they are not really ready, while others seemingly wait forever. Ask your potential teacher what their policy on advancements are, how long they might take, and how these policies might align with your goals as a future teacher.   Ask about the degrees your teacher offers. Do they only offer first-degree classes or is there an opportunity for advancement? Ask your potential teacher to put you in touch with some of their old students for recommendations.  , Taking a healing session from your teacher will help you evaluate your own personal connection to their style, lineage, and practice. Continually check-in with yourself during and after healing to see how the experience feels.   Ask yourself questions, like “Does this healer and healing session invoke gratitude and love, or frustration and repulsion?”  ","['potential teacher', 'online resources', 'reiki teacher', 'yellow pages', 'practitioners', 'mind', 'recommendations', 'use indexes', 'advancement', 'friend', 'teacher', 'practice', 'many students', 'healing session', 'lifestyle']"

While some may find hanging out with a group of co-workers over lunch a break, for the introvert, this is far more work than the actual work day. .   Many people confuse being an introvert for being shy and they are not the same thing. Shyness is a behavior tied often to overwhelming anxiety in social settings and many kids outgrow this stage. Introverts may not feel much anxiety about these situations; they simply do not thrive on the social interactions.Being an introvert isn’t a bad thing nor is it any less appealing as being an extrovert. It is simply another personality type with both strengths and weaknesses.; , Introverts tend to like to make carefully-researched decisions and have a strong attention for details. They also like to gather as much information as possible about a given subject, which makes them good listeners. However, they often work best on their own.Examples of jobs that an introvert may enjoy and thrive in would include research-based roles, writing, design jobs that use a lot of technology without very much interaction with others, and product-testing positions where they can debug and problem solve. They also tend to like to focus their talents on one subject matter to become an “expert” so finding their niche can help them be happy in the career they choose. You may also find that when they are given the freedom to speak as an expert, they are more open to talking to large groups and participating more.  , While there are probably going to be staff meetings you have to attend, things like team-building exercises may not feel of value to you.For the times you are needed on a team at work, talk to the team leader about ways you can use your strengths to contribute to the group. Many introverts like to be well-prepared for meetings so maybe you can volunteer to work on a PowerPoint for the next meeting while others focus on working together. You are contributing and at the same time doing the work alone. It may also be helpful to break down the bigger project into smaller tasks that each member can handle on their own instead of feeling like everything needs to be done together. Again, you are working with the team, just not at the same table at the same time.  , Make a list of all your best qualities. Reference it often. You have many strengths and being mindful of them helps to remind you to use them. It may also help develop positive self-talk to stay calm in the event that you find yourself overwhelmed.Keeping your best assets in the forefront also helps with those around you. The fact that you aren’t always at every meeting may not matter as much if the team knows you are the go-to guy or girl for amazing reports and make them all look good. Know that not every introvert is exactly the same and many times you may not even be 100% an introvert. Take a look at your best qualities and play them up whether or not they “fit” into what an introvert should look like., But, do stretch your comfort zone every now and then. Being a comfortable introvert means recognizing your limitations, and planning ahead for them. Do not be afraid to let your family, friends, supervisor or co-workers know what your limits are. These people may help you to adjust to stressful situations.  For example you might ask for regular communication to be made via email since phone calls are often hard to participate in. This will help them create a better working relationship for both of you. You may be surprised to know that 33-50% of people are thought to be introverts. Your unusual requests are probably not so unusual.Even if those around you are willing to accommodate some of your introverted habits, it’s still a good idea to challenge yourself every now and then. No matter what, interacting with others is a major—and very rewarding—part of life. So, while you don’t want to push yourself to be extroverted, you also don’t want to isolate yourself from having meaningful connections  , Don’t feel pressured to schedule in too many social activities, which can leave you feeling overwhelmed or drained. We do not all “relax” the same way. You may not be able to take in a social lunch with coworkers in the same way they do. If social settings are tiring for you, take lunch alone so that you can recharge for an afternoon meeting or a group project.Instead of always just saying no to well-meaning co-workers who invite you to lunch, schedule a better time to get together one-on-one to make those connections. Also avoid saying yes to invites and then not showing up, it is better to politely decline in the first place.  , Making a point to participate in any event is a step outside of your comfort zone. Give yourself kudos for joining in and use self-awareness to know your limits and decide when you are done at the event.Beyond leaving early, you may feel more at ease by arriving late to get to see specific times of the event like a wedding without having to invest hours into the event as a whole. You want to share in special events without being miserable. Make sure for big events like a wedding or funeral, even in the short amount of time you are there, that you check in with the most important guests so they know you were there. Spending 15 minutes at the wedding reception to congratulate the new couple goes a long way to connect with them as friends without draining your whole energy.  , Unfortunately many people may assume you just don’t like people at all, and this is probably far from true. Introverts tend to thrive on true connections with a small number of people. Create time to interact with people in an environment you feel supported in.When invited to a large event that you think will just be too much, you can let the person know that event would be too much and then offer an alternative in a more intimate setting.  , You need this time to recharge and that request is valid. For the most part those close to you will understand this need. There is no reason to feel guilty for taking a break from social interaction, whatever that breaks means to you., Find activities that energize you and schedule time to enjoy them. Regaining the energy you lost dealing with social situations that were not ideal will look different for each person. Learn what helps you restore and rejuvenate and keep a “tool” kit ready when you need a break.It can be useful to find simple ways to refocus when you are at work and can take a few moments alone. Use your lunch break to sit in the car and listen to a book on tape instead of trying to navigate the crowded lunch room, for example.  , A change in scenery may bring focus that you do not find in crowds. Many introverts find that they enjoy spending time outdoors. Not only is it great for mental health, but going outside can boost creativity and focus and provide a unique source of healing.Incorporate solo nature breaks into your day for small moments of peace and reflection.

Common sources of saturated fat include red meat, poultry, and full-fat dairy products.Trans fat is found in some meat and dairy products, as well as baked goods, chips (potato, corn, and tortilla varieties), fried food, margarine, and some non-dairy creamer.Avoid foods labeled with ""partially hydrogenated,"" as these are often high in trans fat.Health experts recommend limiting your saturated fat consumption to 10 percent or less of your total caloric intake, but advise even lower levels (no more than seven percent of your total calories) to significantly reduce the risk of heart disease.Trans fat intake should be kept as low as possible, as many doctors consider it one of the worst types of dietary fat in existence.; , Our bodies need some fat, and it's important to choose healthy types of fat instead of harmful forms. Healthier sources of fat include monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and omega-3 fatty acids.Good sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats include avocados, olive oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, and corn oil.Common plant-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids include ground flaxseed, canola oil, soybean oil, walnuts, and sunflower seeds.Fish is high in omega-3 fatty acids. Choose healthy fish like salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel, sardines, and herring., Certain high-fiber foods have been shown to be beneficial to the heart, and can even lower cholesterol levels when paired with other lifestyle changes.That's because soluble fiber reduces the absorption of cholesterol in the bloodstream, and can reduce your overall LDL (""bad"") cholesterol levels.Good sources of soluble fiber include oatmeal, oat bran, kidney beans, apples, pears, barley, and prunes.Aim to eat at least five to ten grams of soluble fiber each day to help lower your total and LDL cholesterol., Sterols and stanols are naturally-occurring plant components that have been shown to help block the absorption of cholesterol in the body.Incorporating plant sterols and stanols into a heart-healthy diet can help reduce your cholesterol levels and lower your risk of heart disease.   Plant sterols can lower LDL cholesterol levels by five to fifteen percent, according to some studies.Eat at least two grams of plant sterols/stanols each day to see results in your cholesterol.Sterols are naturally occurring in all plants. Excellent sources of naturally-occurring plant sterols include vegetable oils, nuts/legumes, grains, cereals, and many leafy vegetables.Sterols/stanols are usually added as a fortified supplement to certain foods, including some types of margarine, orange juice, and yogurt drinks. Not every margarine or orange juice will be fortified, so check the label to confirm that a given product has added sterols/stanols., Whey is one of the two primary proteins in dairy products. Whey protein supplements have been shown to lower both LDL cholesterol and overall cholesterol levels.Whey protein powder is a common form of this supplement. You can find it at most health food stores and many grocery stores. Dosing will vary depending on the brand and formula you use, so it's best to follow the instructions on the package., Some studies suggest that a diet low in carbohydrates can help reduce the arterial accumulation of lipids, including cholesterol. Though more research is needed on the subject, it shows promising results in potentially preventing atherosclerosis in people with high cholesterol levels.A heart-healthy low-carb diet should focus on lean protein sources, like poultry, fish, eggs, or tofu, as well as non-starchy vegetables.Most low-carb diets limit daily carbohydrate consumption to roughly 60 to 130 grams.Talk to your doctor about low-carb diets and other options before beginning any dietary plan.  , Studies have shown that plant-based diets, like those followed by vegetarians and vegans, can help lower LDL cholesterol and significantly reduce the risk of heart disease compared to meat-based diets.While many vegetarian- and vegan-friendly foods are still high in sugar and trans fat, a plant-based diet that incorporates fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils is generally considered to be very heart healthy.","['bad fat sources', 'stanols', 'plant sterols', 'plant-based diet', 'carb intake', 'fats', 'whey protein supplements', 'high-fiber foods']"

You'll want to balance working with antiques that you know will yield profit with antiques you are passionate and knowledgeable about. While many dealers have a wide array of offerings, to be most effective, you'll need to find a niche specialization. The most common, though not exclusive, types of antiques that dealers work with include:   Furniture Rugs Sterling Silverware Pottery Jewelry Coins Toys Artwork Glass work Automobiles; , In order to become an antiques dealer, you'll need to build up an inventory. While your interests and expertise should play a big role in how you decide what you want to acquire and sell, your start-up funds will also play a big role. You can take out small business loans to acquire inventory but this is not a sound strategy for antiques. You'll be better off taking your time and using your own money you are able to spare from life expenses.For example, if you want to sell antique cars, the initial investment will be considerably larger than if you are looking to sell vintage toys or rugs. You can get small-business loans to cover inventory acquisition, but this can be risky because market prices fluctuate so greatly, quickly undercutting your profit margins. Also, many antique dealers gain their inventories over time through smart, economical purchases, so a large start-up capital is not as necessary., If you want to become an antiques dealer, you're going to need to learn how to recognize good buys and their potential for re-sale. There is no actual license for antique appraising, however, some locations may have certain regulations to familiarize yourself with, such as laws about antiquities or selling antiques made of regulated goods like ivory. Many times the difference between a viable antique dealer and those that fail is their ability to research and find the best deals.Network. Talk to local antiques dealers, those at conferences and workshops, and even fellow shoppers. This is a great way to get tips of the trade and get real-world education. Most antique dealers are open to sharing their experiences and knowledge. Buy and read books on antiques. You should use a price book for accurate market prices. However, antique books can help you recognize authentic products from frauds. Find reputable book publishers and producers that have been churning out works on antiques for years.  , This is a great way to stay abreast in the industry, network, and constantly learn. Some major associations include: Antiques Dealers' Association, The National Antique and Art Dealers Association of America,The Antiques & Collectibles National Association. These can offer avenues to build your inventory, second opinions on appraisals, leads on finding certain and coveted items and more. You will likely have to pay membership dues, but the payoffs are well worth it.There should also be regional and state associations, too. These will not be as large but could offer meetings that are closer to you and help you understand your regional market., The Appraiser's Association offers a number of programs throughout the country that can serve as education for budding dealers. Some of the most prominent examples include the Comprehensive Appraisal Studies Program (CASP) offers an intensive program every year that meets five days a week. Also, major auction houses like Sotheby's and Christy's offer training ever year.Connoisseurship Programs are offered yearly throughout the year through the Appraiser's Association and offers lectures and seminars, complete with certificates for completion. This is offered in a circuit each year in various parts of the country. Recorded programs are used to provide education that is not limited to a certain area or classroom setting. This can provide many of the lecture series available online or through DVD sets. You can also focus on a college degree that will help you, such as one that specializes in fine arts, art history, or history. A big part of being an antiques dealer is being able to understand the providence of the items you will acquire, their context and craftsmanship. Knowing about history can help have a more discerning eye. Conferences are a great way to learn and network. The most prominent antique dealer conference is held nationally each year by the Appraiser's Association. Here you can begin to learn what it takes to buy and sell your own antiques by getting the inside track of values and selling trends in the industry. You can also use this as a place to network and gain continuing education., These are usually not paid positions, but if there is an antiques shop in your area that has been around and successful for a while, you can approach the person in charge about the opportunity to work under them. This is a great way to see inside the industry without having the same investments and risks.  , When you decide you want to work as an antiques dealer, you'll need to find an entry level path to get started. You may not be able to have your own business right away, as this takes money and experience, but you can choose jobs that will help set you up for success later down the road.   Get a job in antiques shop as a general worker. Work at an auction house as a porter, clerk, cataloger, valuer or auctioneer.  , Once you've gained some experience working in antiques and the knowledge you'll need to succeed, you'll need to start building your stock to sell. Knowing where to find antiques and what to look for is an important part of being a successful dealer. Between shopping around, Craigslist browsing, and garage sale hunting, you'll have plenty of opportunities; and always try to be there first.Look through rummage sales. These can held by churches, individuals looking to get rid of things, or organizations. Looking through these objects can reveal some diamonds in the rough. Keep an eye out for estate sales. These are estate liquidations held by family members. These are usually ran by estate houses that tend to price the items at market value, or even more expensive, so finding bargains isn't real common. However, sometimes as the sale comes to a close the estate house will look to move the rest of their inventory and slash prices.  , While looking through garage sales and second hand goods can make for a great way to build inventory, looking through the inventories of fellow antique dealers can also yield great finds.   Flea markets. While flea markets used to be more like garage sales, they've become a place to buy new and imported goods. Check online for event calendars, local ads, and other antiques publications to see where flea markets are popping up. You can haggle with vendors usually to try and get the best deal possible.  , Many people think it is impossible to make a profit buying items that are already listed by other dealers, but you can find great under the radar items sometimes. For example, sometimes a dealer may be selling something outside their area of expertise and they may under price the item, or lower prices to empty inventory or make a quick sale.   Craigslist and online auction sites like Ebay are also fantastic place to find these sales by reputable antique dealers, as well as for sale by owner ads. As with anything in line you'll want to exercise caution that you're getting exactly what you think, and safely.  , There are so many antiquities considered to be valuable that you should start by finding a few categories that appeal to you, or preferably, antiques which you already have some familiarity with. Gather a thorough understanding of time lines associated with that particular vertical items (i.e. pianos, guitars, coffee tables, china, decanters, matchbox cars, you name it...) and find out which items in that genre are valuable, to whom they are valuable, and why they are valued.   Stay current in what is trendy. Visit online forums, talk to consumers, and pick the brain of successful dealers. This will keep your sales cutting edge.  , Networking and using the above search methods are all important to locating antiques and trying to turn a profit. All of these routes should lead to cost effective sales.   Keep in mind standards qualities. Much like diamonds, the subtle variances in condition, wear, and restorations can mean the difference between hundreds, and hundreds of thousands of dollars! The biggest key to success is knowing what you have or what you've found. This will make it so your products are valuable and more likely to yield you a profit. A good price guide is very important. This will help you know not only what you are buying, but also the fair market price when you go to resell.Some of the most famous are Miller's Antiques and Kovels’ Antiques and Collectibles Price Guide.You can also use your knowledge and skills in antiques to help make extra money on the side that will in turn help you gain funds. Many antique dealers do side work like: restoration, upholstery, insurance services, and estate appraisals. Even if you aren't selling products right away, you can make money by appraising antiques for others with the right knowledge and reputation., There is no need for a brick and mortar business, unless you have an abundance of wealth, antiques, and a client base. You will need to pay rent, electricity and a number of overheads that will cut into your profit margin. Selling and turning a profit is all about the art of negotiation and knowing your market.Consignment is also a great way to make a profit and get a solid footing in the antique industry. You will work on behalf of individuals who are attempting to sell items.You will give them part of the profit but will not typically need to come up with up front capital to acquire this inventory.  , You can sell your inventory at a more low cost venue like a flea market or antique show. This will only require you pay the cost of renting a table. You may have to deal with hagglers, but if you choose a venue with other antique dealers you may find a great clientele base.   Think about selling online. One advantage of selling in modern times is the availability of online markets like E-Bay. List your products online to reach a wider audience. Invest in a good camera so that you can provide high quality, detailed photos of your products.  , Advertising can really help market your products, increase your visibility, and build a successful business. While newspaper and magazine advertising can be useful, this can cost thousands of dollars long-term and they are far from the only way to build up a customer base.   Develop a mailing list. Sometimes antique shops or dealers will have client mailing lists they may be willing to share. If you can get your hands on one of these, you can develop a mailing list of customers to send ads and newsletters. Create a strong internet presence. You will need a professional looking website, but also ways to direct traffic to it. You may have to hire a SEO (search engine optimization) specialist that will make it so your page isn't buried in Google search results. If you are one of the first sites that come up when antique dealers are searched for in your area, this can be a major boon to business.  , Try to move items between 90-180 days after purchase. If you have merchandise in your stock that is over 180 days old, you should reduce the price to get rid of it before adding to your stock any further. This is a good way to not get bogged down with an overstocked inventory. Each of those items sitting in stock are profit you're not making and an investment sitting stagnant. Keep your inventory fresh and profits moving.","['antiques dealer associations', 'internships', 'antiques industry', 'flea markets', 'gain expertise', 'profitable market', 'profit', 'training', 'products', 'niche', 'experience', 'inventory', 'formal education', 'thrift shopping', 'gain hands', 'use markets', 'job', 'finances', 'field', 'method', 'apprenticeships', 'shows', 'consideration', 'shop antiques shops', 'shops', 'success', 'short turnaround']"
"['define personality', 'learn the big five personality traits', 'learn about personality stability', 'assess your personality', 'identify the changes you would like to see']",How to Create a Different Personality1," Prior to identifying your own personality or the personalities of others, you must understand its foundational meaning. Personality is a set of traits, which include a person's mood, emotions, and behaviors. These traits should be pretty stable and consistent prior to labeling yourself or someone else with a particular personality. Your personality can affect both your mood and emotional responses.   Your personality will affect your self-esteem, and it can also influence your interests, morals, values, and belief systems. A person’s identified personality is shaped by many factors, such as, genetics, and personal experiences ( i.e., trauma, parenting, developmental history, etc.).; , In order to create a new personality, you will have to be able to evaluate your current personality and define the new personality you want. To do this, you will need to understand what traits define a personality. The big five personality traits recognized by most psychologists are:Neuroticism Extroversion Openness Agreeableness Conscientiousness  , Understand that an individual's personality is usually much more consistent and stable than their mood or emotions. However, with conscious awareness and effort, it can be changed. A person’s personality is also subject to change as they mature through different phases of life, and as they go through life experiences. For instance, someone who exhibits more of an extroversion personality may become more introverted. If you have a personality that you feel needs changes for improvement, your best strategy is working with a psychotherapist. The psychotherapist will be able to help you identify certain traits you want to change, enhance problem-solving capacities, self-representation, and self-regulation to help you make the positive changes you wish to see in your personality.   Some of the psychotherapeutic modalities used during psychotherapy sessions include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT).  , To make a change in your personality, you will need to have an objective look at your current traits. Rate yourself on each of the big five personality traits. This will give you a baseline for any changes you want to make.Take a standardized tests to rate yourself on the big five personality traits: https://ocean.cambridgeanalytica.org/quiz.html  See a mental health professional for more accurate results. Personality tests are common and frequently used tools with psychotherapists. It allows the psychologist and yourself to fully capture your personality, and work as a team to address any areas of concern you would like to change. These tests are much more detailed and accurate than those you would find online. Some of the more common personality tests used by psychotherapists include:  Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Rorschach Inkblot Test Keirsey Temperament Sorter    , Once you have rated yourself on each of the personality traits, decide which ones you want to see change. You may want to express more of one personality trait and less of another. Make a list of which traits you want to change and in what way you want them to change.For example, you might decide that you want to be more agreeable and less neurotic. As you make changes, you may feel the need to retest your personality. Try to use the same test that you used initially so that you can accurately compare the two results.

"['feel for emotional distance', 'look for extreme defensiveness', 'watch out for sudden aggression', ""see whether she's uncomfortable receiving your kindness"", 'watch out for unprompted affection']",How to Tell if Your Girlfriend Likes Someone Else4," Often, when something is wrong in a relationship, one or both partners can just ""feel"" that they are growing distant emotionally. Where two people once felt close and connected, they now feel like they hardly know each other. Where it was once easy to share emotions, cuddle, and talk about nothing, such interactions now feel forced and ""cold"". This sort of emotional distance can be a sign of a host of relationship problems, including infidelity. If your girlfriend seems cold and distant, press the issue with her — immediately talking with her to learn the root cause is better than languishing in unhappiness.   Note, however, that prolonged emotional distance can be a sign of many relationship problems besides infidelity. The National Healthy Marriage Resource Center pinpoints family and cultural differences, situational conflict, and stress as just a few of many alternate causes., Sometimes, people who know they're doing something wrong can become super-sensitive to any sort of criticism or accusation. Because their misdeeds are fresh in their memory, any sort of innocent teasing or nit-picking can seem like a personal attack. If your girlfriend has surprised you recently with unnecessarily hostile responses to seemingly innocent questions, you may have a serious. Below are a few innocent sample questions that can spell trouble if they're met with anger or frustration:   ""Hey, who was that you were talking to on the phone?"" ""So, what did you do last weekend? ""What are your plans for next Friday?"" ""How are your friends?"" ""Who have you seen recently?""  , In one of the absolute worst-case scenarios for any relationship, one partner may become so enamored with someone else that she actively tries to sabotage the relationship she's already in. This can take the form of aggression, rudeness, frustration, insults, and more. In this case, your girlfriend is most likely trying to get you to break up with her so that she can pursue her new relationship free from guilt.   If your relationship gets to this point, sadly, it may be best to give your girlfriend what she wants. The pain of a quick breakup is usually much less than the pain of staying in an unhappy relationship with someone who actively wants to ruin it.  , Normally, random acts of kindness can provide a spontaneous ""spark"" for a relationship. However, if one partner has been having serious thoughts about someone else, this sort of kindness may simply make her guilty. Almost no one likes receiving appreciation from someone they know they've wronged, so if your girlfriend seems unhappy to receive a gift or some other sort of show of kindness from you, be on the lookout for other warning signs. Below are a few of the sorts of things that normally go over well, but may not if your girlfriend is seriously thinking about someone else:   Gifts for any occasion (especially ""just because"") Fancy nights out Gourmet meals Surprise appearances at work Clearing your schedule ""just for her""  , Paradoxically, while having feelings for another guy can cause your girlfriend to be unusually defensive or aggressive, it can sometimes cause her to be extremely ""nice"" or affectionate. If your girlfriend is worried that you may discover her secret, she may temporarily try to woo you by showering you with kisses, hugs, compliments, cuddling, and more. A girlfriend who suddenly seems intent on keeping you dizzy with constant positive attention for no discernible reason may be up to no good, so be wary — especially if the affection seems to increase whenever you question her activities or whereabouts.   Of course, affection is usually a good thing within the context of a relationship, so don't be suspicious of ordinary, reasonable affection. Getting lots of kisses and a fancy dinner after getting graduating or getting promoted is fantastic, but receiving the same outcome after asking where your girlfriend has been for the past week should be troubling.

"['brush your rabbit regularly', 'trim the rabbit’s nails', 'clean your rabbit’s eyes', 'clean the ears', 'clean out the scent glands']",How to Keep a Rabbit Clean1," Use a soft brush to run through your rabbit’s fur to remove loose hairs as well as dirt and other debris. This will help keep your rabbit’s coat looking shiny and new. Plus, rabbits love being brushed, so it can be pleasant bonding time with your pet.After brushing, you may notice small tufts of fur sticking out of the coat. Go ahead and pull them out, your rabbit will not mind. Rabbits will groom themselves regularly, though they cannot vomit like cats, so they are susceptible to hairballs if they swallow too much hair. Removing loose hairs will help prevent your rabbit from choking.Brush more frequently during shedding times, which occur about every 3 months.; , Your rabbit’s nails will keep growing, so check them once a week to see if they need trimming. They will probably need to be clipped about every month. Nails that are too long become uncomfortable for the rabbit, and can cause toe, nail, or foot injuries, or gait issues.You can do this on your own with a pair of rabbit nail clippers. Make sure your rabbit is lying on its back with the feet up so they are easy for you to get to, and gently clip the nails on one foot at a time. Make sure your rabbit is secure so it can’t kick or scurry away. Once you are finished, you can give your rabbit a treat as a reward. When cutting, a good rule of thumb is to trim the nail to the same length as the fur. Hold up the rabbit’s foot, and trim off the edge in one motion. You shouldn’t cut a nail more than once. If your rabbit has sensitive nails, and struggles some, lightly close the clippers on the area you wish to cut. If your rabbit reacts, move a little further down the nail and away from the skin. It can be helpful to shine a light underneath the nail so you can see where you are cutting. You don’t want to clip the blood vessel at the base of the nail. Baby rabbits will have very sharp, but very small nails. These are probably best trimmed with a emery board instead of the full-size clippers.  , Watch your rabbit’s eyes to keep an eye out for watery eyes or eye discharge. In addition to being a sign of other problems, discharge on your rabbit’s cheeks can cause the skin there to become chafed and have the skin peel off. If you notice anything, a clean tissue should be enough wipe this away. Just be careful not to touch your rabbit’s actual eye.If there is a lot of gunk, or it seems like your rabbit has a lot of tears, take it to the vet to make sure there isn’t a more serious problem.  , Check your rabbit’s ears for waxy buildup. If you notice any, you can remove it by softly rubbing the ear with a cotton swab. Make sure you don’t push the wax into the ear, and do not reach into the ear canal.If you have a problem with wax in the ears, your vet may also recommend some wax removal products that you can apply.Make sure you use a cotton ball and not a smaller swab like a q-tip. If your bunny twitches or jumps during cleaning, you can accidentally push it into the ear, puncturing an eardrum and causing your rabbit to go deaf., Rabbits mark their territory using scent glands under their chin and around their anus. The ones on the rear can get some buildup, which can be uncomfortable for your rabbit, and smell. Lay your rabbit on its back to get a clear look at its rear area. Dip a cotton swap into mineral oil or warm water, and gently dab around the gland to loosen the buildup.","['eyes', 'ears', 'scent glands', 'rabbit', 'nails']"
"['think about the benefits of a small wedding', 'set a budget for your wedding in advance', 'know all of the areas you need to plan for in a wedding', ""cut out what isn't important to you"", 'plan a casual wedding theme', 'use flowers strategically', 'wear for a suit instead of a tux', ""don't buy a wedding dress"", 'get your marriage license first']",How to Plan a Small Wedding1," Having less guests does not make your celebration any less meaningful. On the contrary, it gives you more time to spend with people that matter to you and your partner. Having fewer people will make your day less stressful, allowing you to focus on what really matters -- loving and committing to your partner. Other benefits of small weddings include:  Time to talk to guests beyond a simple ""hello."" A chance to involve more people in the events. Less expensive reception and ceremony. A more intimate, close-knit event.; , You will not have a small wedding if you don’t establish what “small” is. Sit down with your spouse and wedding planner and decide on a concrete amount that you are willing to spend. You can then keep this number in mind as you begin purchasing things for the wedding.   If you don't have a budget in mind it becomes much easier to spend thousands more than you expected. Choose a number and stick to it. In the United States the average wedding costs $25,000. That said, the majority of American couples spend $10,000 or less on a wedding.Each guest at a wedding costs, on average, $250 more at a normal sized wedding., Even small weddings are, in essence, parties that you throw for your friends, family, and spouse. As such, there is a variety of problems and concerns that need to address to make sure everyone has a good time. In general, you need to think about:   Venue for the wedding (church, registrar, etc.) Reception Entertainment Flowers Food, drink, and wedding cake Photographs Transport and Lodging Invitations Decorations and clothing Gifts / Party Favors for attendees.  , A small wedding is about trimming excess and getting rid of things you don't really need. Holding your wedding in your hometown instead of at a big destination means most people can come straight from their house. Don't like flowers? Substitute pictures of you and your spouse for the centerpiece. Look at the above list and ask yourself what is really essential. What can you make yourself? What can you limit or cut back?   Once you've started to trim down your wedding, make estimates about the cost of each thing you still want and compare them to your budget. Remember that a small wedding is often more intimate, giving you time to be with the guests that matter instead of bouncing around to 100 people or more.  , Small and casual weddings allow people to feel much more comfortable and close to one another. Consider ditching elaborate, classy wedding themes like lace or ivy and go for something simple, like a color. Not only do people spend less on clothing, you spend less on decorations that you will only use once. Check out sites like Pinterest, Etsy, or The Knot to browse through thousands of wedding themes on any budget to get craft ideas.   Remember, the theme of your wedding is not important, your marriage is. Make your location a big part of the ""theme."" If you are getting married on the beach, for example, the sand and the surf will be much more enjoyable than hundreds of beach decorations. Use what you have at home or make your own decorations. A few strings of Christmas lights, for example, will create beautiful lighting without breaking the bank. If you already have a lot of green decorations, consider making the color your theme., A tiny arrangement of flowers placed well is often as efficient as having lots of flowers everywhere. Floral arrangements can get very expensive very quickly, so find ways to eliminate or limit them to save money. Some suggestions include:   Use local, seasonal flowers or wildflowers instead of big, exotic bouquets. Buy 1 big beautiful flower (like a rose or chrysanthemum) and use it instead of a full bouquet for a minimal but striking look. Opt for pictures, art, paper flowers, or colorful fruit bowls instead of flowers for an off-beat look., This is a good way for the groom to save money. If you already have a nice black suit, consider wearing it instead of a tuxedo. Even if you do not own a black suit, consider buying one for the wedding instead of renting a tuxedo. The cost of a respectable black suit is usually about the same as a one day tuxedo rental and you can use the suit again in the future.  , It might sound like blasphemy, but wedding dresses are incredibly expensive to only wear once. Opt instead to borrow one from a mother, relative, or close friend. This is not only cost effective, it shows someone how much you care and begins a tradition of passing down a dress across generations.   More and more stores are renting out dresses now, allowing you to get your dream dress for a fraction of the cost., The only things that are truly ""necessary"" for a marriage to happen are two people who want to be together forever, a legal certificate, and a witness or two. Focus on that idea as you plan your small wedding. In CA, for example, a marriage license costs anywhere from $35-100, and that is technically all you need to begin your married life together.   You can always hold a reception later on, or separate from getting your license, in order to save money and cut costs.Some scientists have found a correlation between cheaper weddings and happier couples, so remember to focus on each other, not money.","['suit', 'use flowers', 'areas', 'casual wedding theme', 'advance', 'small wedding', 'marriage license', 'wedding dress', 'budget', 'benefits', 'tux', 'wedding']"

Instead of trying to keep your relationship the same, embrace and appreciate the changes that come with building a more established and long-term relationship.Some people worry about not feeling the same level of infatuation or passion they did in the early days of their relationship, but this is normal. You may have less opportunity for intimacy as your relationship matures with the pressures of work, family, and other commitments. Research suggests, however, that people in committed relationships report they have a more satisfying physical and emotional relationship with their significant other. Instead of worrying about the negative aspects of a more established relationship, think about the positive ways in which your relationship has developed. For example, do you feel your connection with your significant other is deeper? Are you more confident and trusting than you were when you first entered the relationship? What kind of experiences and challenges have you and your partner gone through together?  , Cultivating a long and happy relationship requires both individuals to invest time, energy, and effort.Instead of thinking about maintaining a relationship as “hard work,” think of it as developing and deepening the connection you and your partner share. While this will sometimes mean confronting challenges, there will also be many enjoyable times, special moments, and exciting opportunities. Even if your relationship seems like hard work sometimes, focus on the returns you will receive from your investment.  , Treating each other with respect will help you and your significant other build and maintain a long-lasting and happy relationship. Here are some effective ways to demonstrate that you respect your significant other:   Treat your significant other as you would like to be treated. Be thoughtful and courteous by seeking each other’s opinion and input on important matters, such as parenting, and even about everyday topics such as what you will have for dinner. Consult each other before making plans. Ask about the other person’s work, interests, activities, and feelings. Avoid name-calling or any language and behavior that demeans the other person in the relationship. Sarcasm, nitpicking, and nagging might seem minor, but they can hurt your significant other and make her feel defensive and even hostile.  , Many couples pay special attention to birthdays and anniversaries, but expressing and demonstrating your appreciation for the things your significant other does every day will help you establish a strong and happy relationship.You don’t have to spend money to show you care. Try doing something helpful or thoughtful without prompting. For example, take the trash out or offer to make dinner. Tell your significant other why he is important to you. When your significant other does something nice for you, acknowledge it and say thank you. If you want your significant other to be more appreciative and considerate, then model the same behavior. You can lead by example.  , Poor communication can prevent you and your significant other from having a long and happy relationship. Effective communication will help make sure you and your significant other are on the same page and that you trust each other.Check in regularly with your significant other, and spend time each day discussing more personal, relationship topics rather than just talking about parenting, work, or household chores. Communication isn’t always about talking. It’s also about listening carefully to what the other person has to say. Avoid interrupting each other or talking over one another. When your significant other shares her feelings, acknowledge that you heard her by summarizing what she said. You can start out by saying, “So what I’m hearing or understanding is that. . .” Even if you don’t agree with what the person is saying, this strategy demonstrates that you are paying attention, and it will help you empathize with your significant other. It also usually prevents people from feeling defensive. Face-to-face communication, especially about your relationship, is often more effective than phone calls, texts, or emails. When you can look a person in the eye, observe her body language, and see her reactions, you will be better able to respond to the situation and address any concerns., Couples who are honest with each other are more likely to enjoy a long-lasting and happy relationship. The mistrust that often results from dishonesty can seriously endanger your relationship.Rather than risk losing trust, be honest and let your significant other know about your feelings and concerns. Even if the conversation is uncomfortable and hard, trying to regain his trust after being dishonest will be even more difficult. While honesty is essential to a successful relationship, brutal honesty can be hurtful. Try to be kind and sensitive when you convey your concerns or share unpleasant news. If you are rude and insensitive, your message won’t be well-received and you and your significant other will find it even harder to communicate.  , People demonstrate affection and love differently, and realizing this can help you establish a happier and healthier relationship.Be sensitive to each other’s needs by asking what you both can do to demonstrate love and support. Once you both know what the other person needs, you can make a conscious effort to express your feelings for each other.  , Instead of thinking about how much something your partner does irritates you or is different from how you would approach something, try to appreciate your differences.Think about how your differences complement each other and contribute to your relationship. For example, if you are more serious and your partner is more lighthearted, think about how you help balance each other out. Does your significant other force you not to take things too seriously, and are you able to help her focus on the important things? People often find that a personality trait or habit that is sometimes irritating is also one that initially attracted you to your significant other.  , Oftentimes in more established relationships, people become busy and it can be easy to overlook the importance of sharing quality time with your significant other. Regularly spending time together without interruptions from kids, pets, parents, or work, will help you connect and bond with your significant other.Instead of just watching television or a movie, choose an activity where you interact with each other. You can plan a weekend trip, take a cooking class together, walk around a park, or have dinner together. Many couples find it helpful to schedule regular “date nights.” Plan what you will do together, or alternate so that you plan activities one week while your partner plans them the following week. Make sure you choose different activities so your date nights don’t become too much like a routine., While spending quality time together is essential, making time for yourself will also help you maintain a long and happy relationship. Anyone can grate on each other’s nerves after awhile, and spending a little time away or making time for yourself often helps you appreciate your significant other even more.Pursue separate interests and activities. You’ll feel independent, but also happier and refreshed when you return.  , Challenges are inevitable in a relationship, but your ability to maintain a sense of humor and laugh with your significant other will help you both overcome difficulties.Try reminiscing about a shared experience or go to a place like an amusement park or comedy club where there is lots of laughter. Focus on laughing together rather than at each other, which can make the experience negative and prevent you from bonding with your partner.  , Unhappy in-laws, overbearing parents, and bossy friends can all wreak havoc on the relationship you and your significant other are building. Work with your significant other to keep negative interference to a minimum.You don’t need to cut these people out of your life, but don’t tolerate anyone who refuses to be supportive or who is negatively affecting your relationship. If you or your significant other have concerns about someone intervening in your relationship, talk about it openly and honestly. Work together to brainstorm about potential solutions. For example, if your in-laws insist on coming for Christmas every year, you and your significant other can plan a trip and enjoy some time away from family pressures. You can listen and respond to concerns people may have about your relationship, but you can also politely and calmly explain how their involvement is negatively affecting you and your significant other. An exception to this guideline is if you are in a relationship that is abusive or if there is validity to their concerns. In these cases, don’t isolate yourself or dismiss the people who want to help and support you.

Focus on these skills in your art classes in high school and try to immerse yourself in art history through books, films, and visits to your local museum. You should also try to take classes in computer-aided drafting (CAD) if they are offered at your high school or research CAD online.It will also be helpful to become well versed in creative writing and storytelling, as a big element of the role of a computer animator is bringing stories to life. Take a drama or class in theater as well as a writing class to help develop your creative skills. A good understanding of scientific fields like physics, and a strong grasp of mathematics will also help you become a better animator.; , Most employers require applicants to have a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Animation from an accredited university or college. You will learn the necessary skills in digital art, drawing, and storyboarding, as well as the computer software needed to be a qualified computer animator.You may decide to specialize in a specific area of computer animation, such as game design. You would then pursue your Bachelor of Science in Game Design and Development. This degree program will help you attain the skills required to design video games and training simulations. Keep in mind some computer animators are self-taught and learn their skills from mentors working in the field. However, even self-taught animators will take animation or art-related classes to further develop their skills and make them more employable.  , Many bachelor level programs in computer animation will allow you to develop your software skills and give you a basic level of understanding of several different computer programs. There are several commonly used software packages in the computer animation industry that may be useful for you to learn, including:Flash Maya 3D Studio Max Lightwave 3D Aftereffects Photoshop Illustrator CorelDraw You may also need to learn software packages on the job that are specific to your employer or to your role. You should be open to learning new software and able to adapt to the changing software demands of computer animation.  , Some bachelor programs in computer animation have an internship component where you can gain practical experience at an animation studio. Many internships are available during your junior year of school and have a basic level of technical knowledge.You can also apply for internships outside of your program through organizations like The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Foundation.  , The biggest selling point for any computer animator is their demo reel, which is a video based portfolio that showcases their best work. In fact, 51% of industry experts note that your demo reel is the most important element of landing a job or a client.Your demo reel should be dynamic, engaging, and well put together. Try to upload your demo reel to the web so it is easy to access for potential employers.Your demo reel should be well edited to show your drawing, painting, or sculpting skills if you are strong in these areas. Focus on video that shows your use of an extendable rig, a walk cycle turntable, and any collaborative work you have done with other animators or other creatives. Your demo reel should also show your unique animation style and be engaging for the viewer from beginning to end.You should also create a professional website to post examples of your current projects and to better showcase your demo reel. When you upload your demo reel to your website, make sure you copyright it and are able to retain control over it once it is online. Include your resume, your contact information, and a brief bio. You should also include concept sketches, storyboards, sketches, or drawings that you are proud of to give potential employers a better sense of your visual style.  , Membership to an industry association like the Computer Graphics Society (CG Society) or the ASIFA Hollywood Association can give you a platform to share your work with other animators and to attend workshops to further develop your animation skills.Membership to these associations are not free but they do come with many perks and many of these associations have job listings that are only available to members.  , If you have managed to land a great internship at an animation studio, you should try to network with as many peers, supervisors, and creatives as the studio as possible. Establishing good working relationships during your internship could then translate to a full time position once your graduate from your undergraduate program.  , Before you apply for positions at animation studios, you should consider if you would like to focus on an area of specialization or a specific industry. Are you more interested in animation for the motion picture and video industry or the advertising and public relations industry? Maybe you would prefer to work on character animation and visual effects at a large studio or as a teacher or administrator in a computer animation program. Narrowing down your interests can allow you to apply for open positions that speak to your level of interest and you can then demonstrate your passion for a certain industry or position in your job interviews.You should tailor your resume to reflect the skills required for the positions you are applying for. This could mean highlighting your character animation experience and visual effects experience for a character animation position at an animation studio, as well as your strong communication skills and your strong grasp of software packages. Or you may emphasize your story boarding experience and your passion for storytelling for a position in motion picture animation. If you are interested in becoming a freelance computer animator or starting your own computer animation studio, you should spend several years working under a mentor who can help you to develop your artistic skills and your business knowledge. You should put in at least five years of working for others and learning from mentors in the industry before you decide to strike out on your own as a freelancer or a studio owner., A computer animator is different than a cartoonist as an animator works with 3D software to build animated objects, people, and images. Though you will need to have excellent drawing skills, you will be using software and computers to create animations, rather than pen and paper.As a computer animator, you will still be able to tell stories and be artistic but you will also need to be skilled in software and computers. You are expected to be a highly skilled visual artist who can use technology with confidence and expertise.  , The average yearly salary for multimedia animators was $64,470 in 2013.However, your pay can fluctuate based on the industry you are employed in. You may also be paid more or less if you work per hour rather than on a salary basis. Computer animators who work for themselves as freelancers may arrange hourly pay or pay per project, depending on their clients.   The highest paying industries for computer animators are the motion picture and video industries ($84,610) and the software publishers industry ($72,230). You may also be employed in the computer systems design industry, with an annual mean wage of $67,740, the advertising and public relations industry ($65,760) and the specialized design services industry ($63,350)., The work environment for a computer animator will shift depending on what industry you work in and if you work for a large animation studio or on your own as a self-employed animator.   If you work at a large animation studio, you will likely work in an office environment with other animators and designers. You may work in a team on specific projects or have a hand in several ongoing projects at a time. If you work for yourself as a freelance computer animator, you will likely work from a home office.

Full-length gowns, while appropriate for prom, are a classic homecoming faux pas. Homecoming dresses tend towards tighter, more sleek silhouettes and cuts that allow for comfortable dancing and movement. However, a bit of tulle or ruffles is perfectly permissible as well. Straps or some form of support are recommended, and if a dress is strapless, be sure that it fits impeccably. While the dress's length and cut should be fun and sleek, remember that you won't want to be worrying about your dress when you're on the dance floor!; , While homecoming is fun and casual, it is also traditionally in late autumn. Bright colors, tie-dye patterns, or summery florals are not the components of a perfect homecoming dress. Dark colors, whites, ivories, metallic tones, or blacks are good colors for a solid homecoming dress. As for prints, animal prints are always a fun option, or a dark, elegant brocade can also be stunning with a youthful cut. Also, fabrics with a sheen to them are a staple of homecoming attire.  , While all-over sequins may jump off of a magazine page, they might not be the best choice for a homecoming dress. If your school has a strict dress code (i.e., no sleeveless dresses) make sure that you have a shawl or shrug to cover your shoulders. Also, be sure to pair your dress with a chic coat, because chances are the night is going to be chilly. Lastly, keep the term ""semi-formal"" in mind. Dresses with too many runway ruffles, or other cumbersome forms of ornamentation, are not the best choice for homecoming.  , Your homecoming dress should reflect your day-to-day style and personality. Are you outgoing, brash, and flirtatious? Your perfect dress may be Animal Print, or a dazzling one-shoulder silhouette. Do you normally dress classically, with an elegant touch? A dark, shimmering brocade or floral with a sweetheart neckline and a clean hem may be your perfect dress. Are you quirky, fun and creative? Maybe some tulle, ruffles, or bows will make an appearance on your perfect dress. The girls who really stun at homecoming are the ones that can take their personal style and reflect it in the limited colors, fabrics, and cuts of a homecoming dress.  , It may take a few months to chance upon that perfect homecoming dress, so make sure you start early! An early start means that more dresses will be in stock, the stores will be less crowded, and if a store doesn't have your size in stock they can ship it in time for homecoming  , Your dress should make you feel fun without overpowering your natural beauty. It should fit very well and flatter your body type, and be secure enough to stay steady after an hour of dancing. You should feel special in your homecoming dress, and be able to walk into your school confidently and ready for fun.  , Once you have the perfect dress, try to find pieces that make it even better. If your neckline is open, maybe a statement necklace will add punch to your look, or perhaps a shimmering bracelet will add some needed sparkle. When selecting shoes, keep comfort in mind, While at many schools, heels are taken off to ease dancing in about an hour, it's still a good idea to pick a low or medium heel (i.e., anything above 2 1/2 inches is pushing it.)  , Generally, homecoming hairstyles have some hair down and some up, with gratuitous curls. However, a sleek, effortless ponytail or free-flowing waves can work wonders with certain dresses. Flip through prom magazines or photos of your school's homecoming for hairstyle ideas. Makeup should be fun, but also light and durable. A solid foundation and a glossy lip with some shimmering eye shadow, light eyeliner, and your best mascara should do the trick.

Therefore, focusing part of your exercises on your chest can help you work towards an hourglass figure.One simple way to work on your chest muscles is to do push-ups. Lay face down on the floor, with the balls of your feet touching the floor. Lift yourself off the floor with arms, keeping your body straight. You don't need to go down all the way to the floor, but you should at least go down until your elbows form a 90-degree angle.You can also try dumbbell flys. On your back, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Bend your arms so your hand meet above your chest. Keeping your arms bent, bring the dumbbells outward, until you eventually straighten each arm all the way out, like you're going to give someone a hug. Bring your arms back to your chest. Try repetitions of six or eight with rests in between.; ,  Part of the hourglass figure is a trim waist. To have a trim waist, you need to lose weight overall, as focusing just on your waist is not possible.Do aerobic exercises such as biking, swimming, or running. Try to get in about 30 minutes a day.Eat well. Focus on fruits, veggies, whole grains, and low-fat protein, such as fish and poultry. Try to skip foods with processed sugar and trans fat. Stick to healthy fats such as avocado, nuts, and fish.Pick up good habits, such as getting enough sleep. Also, don't smoke. Improving your habits makes you healthier overall and helps you lose weight.,  To get a toned rear, you need to focus exercises in this area. Try doing squats and lunges to help build muscle. In addition, try to pick aerobic exercise that will build muscle in this area, such as running.,  Before putting on makeup, take some time to gently massage your face. The purpose is to get your blood pumping to your face, as well as to reduce any swelling or puffiness.Try applying a massage cream first to help with the massage.When rubbing, rub from the center of your forehead outward in circular motions. Similarly, when you rub the skin near your eyes, rub from the bridge of your nose outward, both above and below.Go down your nose and rub your nostrils in an up and down motion. Move outward from the center of your face around your lips. Move in circular motions up your cheeks. Finally, using your whole hand, move from the center of your face out to your ears. You can wipe any excess cream off at the end.,  If you're using a liquid foundation, it's important to warm it up in your hand first. That way, it won't sit on top of your skin. Rather, it will be more readily absorbed into your skin, helping it glow.,  Powder can keep you from looking shiny. However, stick to the forehead, nose, chin, and sides of your face, skipping the eyes and cheeks. That way, you won't look shiny, but you will glow in all the right places.,  Lopez often has very dramatic eye makeup. The makeup makes her eyes pop, pulling the focus there.For instance, try applying a gray eye shadow to your eyelids. Use a black or dark eye liner on both your upper and lower lids. Finally, add two coats of black mascara.If you want to go even more dramatic, try a trick that Lopez's stylists use. They often add fake eyelashes to enhance her eyes.,  That is, pick a nude or light color for your lips. Lopez often has a nude lip to help her look flawless. Pick a color in your skin tone, though it can have a hint of pink or shimmer.,  Lopez often sports a high ponytail for an easy every day look or even a look for a night on the town.

Often times, they have cutouts that are a bit revealing. She's not afraid to show off her body. In fact, she often has dresses that have cutouts along the sides.,  Lopez sometimes sports dresses that use lace as a way to reveal some skin. Other dresses she chooses use other sheer fabrics in much the same way, strategically placing opaque fabric or even sequences over parts of her body.,  Lopez radiates wherever she goes. You may be tempted to try a tanning bed or stay outside to tan, but a safer bet is a spray tan or lotion. Don't forget to put on gloves before you apply it, though, as it will stick to the palms of your hand and your fingertips.,  Don't pick one that's too dark for your skin tone. If you want to go darker, just apply the tanner more than once. In addition, skip the sprays. Creams, lotions, and mousses are much easier to use and make for better results.,  By getting off the dead skin first, you'll end up with a more even tan.It's also important to moisturize for the same reason. Apply a light moisturizer before you apply the tan.,  In addition, add a bit to your hairline. This precaution will help keep the tanner out of these areas.,  Go with your arms, legs, torso, and back first. Next move on to your knees, feet, ankles, and neck. You can buff out any place that's too dark with a towel.,  After you apply tanner, put something you don't mind staining, as tanner can stain. In addition, pick something loose, that won't stick too closely too your skin will the tanner absorbs.","['eyes', 'bit', 'waist', 'petroleum jelly', 'eyebrows', 'rear', 'tan', 'skin', 'shower', 'statement', 'chest muscles', 'powder', 'foundation', 'instant glow', 'face', 'tanner', 'lips', 'old clothes', 'pick earrings', 'right', 'high ponytail', 't-zone', 'lace', 'little skin']"

Instead, the term refers to any property used for business purposes, included residential spaces leased out to tenants and raw land that will be developed. The major types of commercial real estate, more specifically, include:   Retail: These are properties leased to commercial tenants, like malls, strip malls, and other types of shopping centers. Residential: These are typically apartments, but can vary widely in their setup (high rise apartments, garden apartments, etc.). Hotels: This includes any type of hotel or motel. Office: work spaces for businesses. Industrial: manufacturing spaces like factories and warehouses. Land: this can be either developed or undeveloped (raw) land.; , Commercial real estate investment has numerous benefits for potential investors. Depending on the real estate market, the number of leases already in place, and the overall condition of the property, investors can turn a significant profit. Some potential benefits of investing in commercial real estate are:   Many investors purchase raw land that may increase in value as developers build on surrounding land. In addition, developing the land itself increases its value and attractiveness to other buyers.You have the potential to generate significant income, including an annual return on the purchase price that can be 6 percent or higher. Unlike residential real estate leases, commercial property owners and tenants both have a vested interest in maintaining the property to support and increase business. This works in favor of the property owner since the property lessee is more likely to invest in creating a workable and attractive space. You may be able to enter into a triple net lease, whereby the lessee pays for property expenses and real estate taxes and the buyer is only required to pay the mortgage. Large companies with many retail spaces are more likely to enter into these types of leases. Typically, commercial leases are more flexible because they are not regulated as closely as residential leases since the lessee and lessor are typically both business entities., In deciding to purchase a property, a potential owner must consider the risks as well as the potential benefits. In evaluating risk, buyers should assess the following risks:   A buyer must consider how much time they have to dedicate to the management of the property. The owner is responsible for managing each property, assessing safety and maintenance issues, and drafting leases. An investor who wants to see a large return should expect to spend a significant amount of time on the needs of the property. If management of the property becomes too burdensome, the buyer might need to retain expert help to manage all aspects of the purchase and maintenance of the property, which could require a significant financial outlay. You may be required to put forth a large down payment or put money into replacing a roof or repaving a parking lot., While some residential real estate investors will purchase, rehab and resell a property for a profit within a small time frame, commercial real estate investment typically requires a longer time commitment. Some experts recommend that commercial property investors hold onto the property for at least ten years to see a significant and stable return on their investment. If you are looking to make money quickly, with little time commitment, commercial real estate may not be your best option., Generally, individuals cannot finance the purchase of a commercial real estate venture on their own. In order to raise the significant amount of capital that is required in a commercial real estate investment, the investor will generally have to find outside financing. This means applying for a commercial loan, working out seller financing with the current owner, or finding partner investors to raise the funds and to help guide the investment. Finding experienced investors is particularly important for first-time investors. When looking for partners consider the following:   Do they have experience in commercial real estate transactions? Do they have enough cash or credit to help you secure a mortgage? What type of investment return do they want? What level of management, if any, do they want with the property?, In order to locate and acquire prime commercial real estate, you should hire a commercial real estate broker who has significant experience with commercial properties. When evaluating a broker, consider the following:   Make sure that your broker is not only experienced in finding property but also in locating potential tenants for the property. Make sure that the broker is experienced in commercial transactions and not residential transactions. Identify a broker who is established in the community, has an office, and financial stability so that he/she is able to prioritize your business needs and is not focused on their commission or fee. Ask other commercial property owners for recommendations. These owners may be the best source in vetting potential brokers. Meet with several brokers before you make a decision., These attorneys will be experienced in dealing with contracts, property law, and state and local laws regarding real estate transactions. You want to find an attorney who has experience representing commercial real estate buyers. When choosing an attorney, consider the following:   Retain an attorney that has worked in the community in which you are investing.By hiring a local attorney, you can more easily ask former clients for their opinion of the attorney. You can locate an experienced attorney by asking for a recommendation from other businesses or by contacting your state bar association and using their attorney referral system.  , You want a CPA who is experienced working with commercial real estate transactions. A CPA can help you evaluate the financials of a property, advise you about its investment potential, prepare financial statements and review contracts (although this will primarily be the responsibility of your attorney). Consider the following when identifying a CPA:   Ask yourself whether the CPA is someone you feel that you can work with for a long time. A good CPA will continue to work with you well beyond the initial purchase of the property so it is important to establish a good working relationship. Interview multiple CPAs to get a sense of who would best meet your business needs. Ask them to discuss their credentials, services and fees. Ask them to discuss their specialization in tax and accounting and whether they could help form an LLC. Ask for a list of references for whom they handled commercial real estate-related business., When deciding what type of commercial property you want to purchase, ask your broker to explain the different types of commercial properties and the benefits and drawbacks for each. Even if you have invested in commercial property in the past, you should still make a full evaluation of what type of property best suits your current needs. Commercial properties include:   Office buildings include properties located in central business districts or in suburban office parks. Industrial properties include properties for manufacturing as well as warehouses. Retail properties include strip malls of varying sizes, regional malls and area set aside for retail chain restaurants or other retail stores. Apartment buildings, which may include smaller apartment buildings of 3 to 4 stories, midrise buildings that are between 5-9 floors and include an elevators as well as high rise buildings. Many commercial real estate investors focus on raw land, which can either be developed or held with the hope that the land increases in value as other investors develop the land around it.Hotels are also a type of commercial property.Some investors may think that they would be more comfortable investing in an apartment building because it seems more familiar. Yet, when making your investment you should consider whether an apartment building as opposed to an office building or strip mall meets your specific investment goals. You should also discuss these goals with your lawyer and CPA. Be sure to look at a variety of locations as well as property types. The property’s location could significantly impact the rate of return as well as the amount of the initial investment., In addition to finding the right location, your property must be zoned for the type of business that you want conducted. When evaluating a property you should determine the following:   How the property is currently being used. Zoning allowances and exclusions for the property—what type of business can and cannot be conducted at the location., There can be any number of reasons why a person or business is looking to sell its commercial property holdings. When looking at specific properties, try to determine:   Why the owner is selling the property. This information may be able to help you in negotiation. Determine if there are any major repairs necessary. Explore the area surrounding the property to determine how local business and real estate is doing and whether there are any major changes proposed for the area., While you may have a modest or semi-modest approach to your investment initially, you should always be thinking about future expansion of the property. You should determine if there is room for growth or are there leasing alternatives if your business fails to thrive., Because of the significant cost associated with purchasing commercial property, most buyers have investors and need to secure a loan from a reputable lender. The lender will help you get financing in place to purchase the property. You should look for lenders that are experienced in commercial real estate..   Consider using a lender with whom you have an established relationship. This may help you to more easily secure the loan. Lenders with experience with commercial transactions will be able to direct you to a variety of funding opportunities and should be well versed in any necessary paperwork and regulations.  , Once you make an offer and the offer is accepted, you need to have the property thoroughly inspected before going forward with the purchase. You want to ensure that they physical property is in working condition and then you can negotiate with the seller over any work, such as a new roof, that is required., Before finalizing the purchase, you should speak with an insurance agent about what types of coverage you need for the property if you choose to move forward on the purchase. You want to make sure that your coverage is established and in effect on the date that you become the property owner., The seller is required to turn over information about the property, which includes any physical or environmental issues that impact the property. Depending on the seller’s disclosures, you may need to take additional steps to evaluate any potential environmental impacts and make sure you are following federal environmental law., Once you have evaluated the physical property, the potential impact on the environment, and the seller’s disclosures, you should have your experts create a detailed analysis of the potential income and expenses. It is important that you conduct this analysis before purchasing the property in order to verify that it is still a sound investment., Have your lawyer explain every detail of the sales agreement so that you understand your rights and obligations. Generally, your sales agreement should contain the following:   The agreement should be in writing and include any agreements made by buyer and seller, as well as the signatures of the buyer(s) and seller(s). If there is a dispute between the parties, the court will closely examine the contract in evaluating the parties’ claims. Specify under what circumstances a party can terminate the contract and that the notice of termination must be in writing.The agreement should contain the names of the parties, the address and a description of the property, as well as the sale price and the closing date. The contract may specify the type of deed that will be delivered to the buyer at closing. The buyer should state that the purchase is contingent on getting a mortgage, if applicable. The seller should specify that the property is being sold “as is” or outline any work that will be done on the property prior to the closing date. They buyer should state that the sale is contingent upon a thorough inspection of the property.","['types', 'insurance agent', 'potential expansion', 'certified public accountant', 'variety', 'benefits', 'expense analysis', 'owner', 'commercial properties', 'investment strategy', 'detailed income', 'commercial real estate', 'commercial real estate attorney', 'risks', 'lender', 'property', 'available uses', 'commercial real estate investment', 'financing', 'different types', 'disclosures', 'cpa']"

Peel the potatoes and discard the peels. Carefully cut the potatoes into 1-inch pieces and place them in a 4-quart saucepan.Avoid using waxy potatoes like Yukon golds which aren't as starchy as the russet potatoes.; , Fill the saucepan with enough cold water to completely cover the pieces of potato. Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let the potatoes bubble lightly. Simmer the potatoes for about 15 minutes. They should be tender if you poke them with a fork.For extra flavor, you can add a few pinches of salt to the water that you boil the potatoes in.  , Wear oven mitts and drain the water out of the saucepan. Place the potatoes back into the pan and turn the heat on medium. Let the potatoes cook for about three minutes so they dry out a little. Turn off the heat and use a potato masher to mash the potatoes in the pan. Transfer the mashed potatoes to a mixing bowl.The mashed potatoes should be completely smooth since it may be difficult to fill the pierogi with lumpy mashed potatoes.  , Melt 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter or olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot and the butter is melted, add 3 medium onions that are finely chopped. You should have about 3 3/4 cups of chopped onion. Saute the onions for about 15 to 20 minutes. They should become caramelized and soft. Divide the sauteed onions into two portions.Set aside one portion to use as a garnish for the cooked pierogi. The other portion will be mixed into the filling mixture.  , Add one portion of the sauteed onions into the mixing bowl with the mashed potatoes. Add 10 ounces (280 g) of crumbled farmer cheese along with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Stir the mixture so the filling is combined. Set the mixture aside.The filling should be at room temperature before you use it to fill the pierogi dough.  , Place 7 cups (2 pounds or 875 g) of unbleached all-purpose flour into a large mixing bowl. Add 1/2 cup (113 g) of the butter into the mixing bowl. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour. Keep rubbing it until the flour and butter feel sandy or crumbly.Use butter that's cold or it will be difficult to rub the butter into the flour.  , Measure out 2 cups (475 ml) of warm water. Pour 1 3/4 cups (415 ml) of the water into the flour and butter mixture. Use your fingers to stir the mixture until it starts to form a dough. If the mixture is too dry to come together, stir in the remaining 1/4 of a cup (60 ml) of warm water one tablespoon at a time.The dough will look like a shaggy lump once it's ready to knead.  , Sprinkle a counter or work space with flour and place the shaggy dough on the counter. Use the palms of your hands to gently knead the dough. Knead it until it's smooth and stretchy. Keep in mind that the dough won't be completely smooth so don't overwork the dough or it will be tough.If you want to make the dough ahead of time, you can cover the dough with a dishtowel for up to one hour.  , Lay a sheet of parchment paper onto a large baking sheet. Sprinkle flour over the parchment paper. Take the pierogi dough and divide it into six balls. Each ball should weigh about 8 ounces (225 g). Set one ball on your work space and keep the others covered with a clean dishtowel.   Each ball of dough should be about the size of an orange., Use a rolling pin to roll a ball of dough into a large circle that's 10 to 11-inches (25 to 28 cm) wide. The circle of dough should be 1/8-inch (3 mm) thick. Work with one ball of dough at a time so they don't dry out.You may need to sprinkle more flour over your work space if the dough starts to stick.  , Dip a 3-inch (7.5 cm) round cookie cutter into flour. Use the cutter to cut small circles out of the large circle of dough. Place the dough circles on your prepared baking sheet and sprinkle them with a little extra flour. Lay another sheet of parchment paper over the dough circles. Continue rolling, cutting, and stacking the circles of dough.Stacking the dough circles between parchment will keep the dough from drying out.  , Brush the extra flour off of a dough circle and place it in the palm of your hand. Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the potato cheese filling onto the center of the dough and fold the circle over the filling. It should make a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges of the circle to seal in the filling. Place the filled pierogi back on the baking sheet. Do this for all of the dough circles.Keep the filled pierogi covered with a clean dishtowel or plastic wrap while you fill the remaining pierogi.  , Turn the oven on to 175 degrees F (80 C) while you bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Once the water boils, add 10 to 12 pierogi to the pot and stir them to prevent sticking. Boil the pierogi for about one to two minutes. They should float to the top of the pot when they're cooked.If you refrigerated the pierogi, you may to boil them for an extra minute or two. If you froze the pierogi, they should boil for 7 to 10 minutes.  , Use a slotted spoon to scoop out the cooked pierogi from the pot of boiling water.

At this point, you can serve the boiled pierogi.Let the water come back to boiling before you add the next batch of pierogi to the pot. This will ensure they cook evenly.  , For soft dumpling-like pierogi, serve the pierogi after they've been boiled and drained. Melt 1/2 cup (113 g) of butter in a small saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Remove the warmed pierogi from the oven and sprinkle them with the sauteed onion that you reserved for the garnish.

You can grow facial hair much faster if your face is consistently kept clean.   Wash your face with warm water and a gentle facial cleanser once in the morning and once in the evening. A gentle cleanser is recommended over standard soap, since standard soap can be too abrasive for the skin on your face and may cause irritation. You should also wash your face any time of the day that it gets notably dirty with sweat or oil. If an itchy rash develops as your facial hair grows in, try using a dandruff shampoo two to three times weekly to relieve the irritation.Switch to an exfoliating facial cleanser once a week to strip away dead skin cells. After washing your face, use a moisturizing facial lotion to keep the skin hydrated and to prevent dead skin cells from gathering and clogging up your follicles.; , As such, one of the best things to do in order to keep your facial hair grow faster is simply to let it grow without disruption.   Hair growth increases faster immediately after you shave, but it decreases hair growth shortly thereafter. As such, any increase in hair growth that does result from shaving gets canceled out. Note that your facial hair can get a bit unsightly as it initially grows out, so it is recommended that you start at a time during which you do not need to appear at work or any formal social events.  , While this may seem a little unconventional, a light massage over your face can encourage the hair follicles there to grow in faster and thicker.   Apply gently yet even pressure along the areas of your face over which you want to stimulate hair growth. Rub in small circular motions, and massage your face consistently for about 10 to 15 minutes twice daily.  , Simply put, stress thins out your hair, making it difficult to grow a beard, mustache, or goatee. Reducing stress as much as possible can greatly increase the rate at which your facial hair grows.Both mental and physical stress can cripple your immune system, thereby limiting your ability to grow facial hair. Stress can be nearly impossible to eliminate completely, but you can take small steps to limit the amount of stress in your life. Try meditation or exercise as a means of releasing anxiety or talk to others about effective ways of reducing stress.  , Proper rest is a key element in maintaining all of your body's functions, including hair growth.   Sleep is a period of time during which your body regenerates lost cells, and hair growth tends to increase during periods of sleep. If you sleep for less than six hours each night, growing facial hair quickly is all but impossible. For best results, sleep for at least eight hours nightly.  , As with sleep, regular exercise is also a key element of maintaining bodily functions, including hair growth. Focus on aerobic exercise, which improves blood circulation.   Good blood circulation helps you to maintain a high metabolic rate. In other words, all of the nutrients you take in that can help stimulate hair growth will reach the hair follicles in your face much faster if you have the sort of good circulation promoted by aerobic exercise. Even mild to moderate aerobic exercise is better than nothing. Take a brisk 30-minute walk each day after work, or better yet, go for a jog.  , Smoking weakens the body's immune system, and with a weakened immune system, your body may not be able to grow hair as effectively as it could.   Nicotine reduces your body's ability to absorb nutrients. As a result, the nutrients needed for hair growth cannot reach your hair follicles well enough to work. Moreover, nicotine also constricts blood vessels, which prevents your blood from going where it needs to go.  ,   The hair itself is built partially of protein, and healthy hair is coated in oils and fats. As a result, a healthy, fast-growing beard or mustache needs both protein and fat. Additionally, protein and fat can increase testosterone, another key player in growing facial hair. Beans and fish are healthy sources of protein, and eating more of these foods can stimulate faster, bushier hair growth. Eggs and animal fat can be effective, as well, but limit your overall intake of these fats since they can cause circulatory problems if consumed in excess.  , Sugar, on the other hand, can actually make hair weaker. Eating too many foods high in sugar can make it harder to grow facial hair.   Natural sugars found in fruits and dairy are less harmful than those found in candy, baked goods, and soda. ok  , Vitamin B7, also called biotin, is one of the most important vitamins to have when trying to grow facial hair. Vitamins B5, B3, and B9 are also very important, though.   Biotin is found in nuts and egg yolk. You must ingest the biotin for it to be effective, though. Applying it topically will not help. If you cannot get biotin naturally, take a biotin supplement daily. Vitamins B5 and B3 improve your circulation and can be found in chicken, beef, fish, egg yolk, avocado, milk, and many whole grains. Vitamin B9, or folic acid, directly impacts your ability to grow thicker hair and can be found in cereals, nuts, and leafy green vegetables.  ,   Vitamin A helps maintain your follicles and sebum, and it can be found in carrots, broccoli, and leafy green vegetables. Vitamin C improves your immune system and can be found in potatoes, citrus fruits, green peppers, tomatoes, and dark leafy green vegetables. Vitamin E improve circulation and can be found in beans, nuts, and leafy vegetables.  , In order to stay in your peak bodily condition, you need to be fully hydrated at all times. Only in your peak condition can your facial hair grow as fast as possible.   As a general rule, drink roughly eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses each day.  , Eucalyptus is thought to help stimulate hair growth, but you should never apply eucalyptus oil directly to the skin. Instead, dilute it with water or use facial skin care products containing the plant as an ingredient.Dilute eucalyptus oil by combining four parts water with one part eucalyptus. Apply directly to the skin with a cotton ball and let sit. Note, however, that if your skin becomes irritated, you should wash the treatment off and avoid it in the future. Facial cleansers and moisturizers with eucalyptus are more highly recommended than oil.  , Amla oil is thought to be one of the most helpful natural oils you can use to coat the follicles in your face.   Mix 1/4 cup (60 ml) Amla oil with 3 Tbsp (45 ml) mustard leaves, blending until a paste forms. Apply this paste to your face and let it sit for 20 minutes before washing it off.Any remaining paste can be saved in the refrigerator for two to three days. In addition to Amla oil, other oils that help with facial hair growth include jojoba and grape seed oil. These oils can be applied directly to the skin without mixing them with mustard leaves.  , These ingredients can be combined into a thin paste that should be applied to your face twice daily to help stimulate facial hair growth faster.   Combine 1 Tbsp (15 ml) ground cinnamon with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) vitamin-C-rich lime juice. Apply this to your face and rinse off after 25 to 30 minutes. Stop immediately if irritation occurs.  , This topical hair growth drug is traditionally used to stimulate hair growth on the top of your head, but some preliminary findings suggest that it may help stimulate facial hair growth, as well.   Purchase a bottle of minoxidil. Hold the can upside-down and press the nozzle to squeeze out some of the foam onto your fingers. Gently massage this foam into your face, concentrating on areas in need of speedy hair growth.You should usually only apply 1/2 capful of foam or 1 mL of solution two times daily. Read the instructions on the label to avoid accidental overdose. Consult your doctor before trying to use minoxidil to stimulate facial hair growth.  , This is an oral drug traditionally used to stimulate hair growth on the top of you head, but as with minoxidil, some findings indicate that it may help facial hair, too.   This drug can increase your testosterone by 10 to 20 percent, resulting in increased body and facial hair.This medication is only available by prescription. Follow the instructions carefully to avoid accidental overdose. Usually, the medication will be taken in tablet form once daily. You should take it around the same time each day., Men who really have a hard time growing facial hair may lack the testosterone needed to do so. Careful testosterone therapy can help remedy this problem.   Therapy is usually performed through injections or topical applications. There are oral treatments, as well, but these can cause liver damage and are not recommended. Your doctor needs to monitor testosterone therapy carefully. Too much of this hormone can actually further inhibit your hair growth. Note that this may not be a “fast” solution, since testosterone therapy can take up to a full year to really kick in.  , If you are desperate enough and no simpler solution has worked, a plastic surgeon might be able to transplant some fast-growing hair follicles from other parts of your body to your face.   The treatment is simple and usually performed on an outpatient basis. You may experience minor skin irritation, but that is usually the worst of it. As with testosterone therapy, however, this is not the quickest solution possible. You may need to wait up to two full years before adequate facial hair growth is achieved.

Generally speaking, neurons are specialized cells of the nervous system of all living systems including mammalians. The two main neuronal types in humans are motor and sensory neurons. Sensory neurons are one type of cells that is very important for the proper communication of the body with the environment. Without these neurons the body would be considered in a state of partial death due to the lack of its ability to communicate with the surrounding environment.; , Sensation is an important physiological process that is crucial for the sustaining of life of the living tissue. For example instinctual needs of humans such as the need to urinate and defecate are mediated through sensory neurons that are located in the urinary bladder and in the nervous system of the alimentary canal. These sensory neurons send electrical signals that are formed through action potentials to the brain where it is perceived by specialized neurons in the sensory area of the cerebral cortex. In turn motor neurons of the cerebral cortex also initiate the processes of defecation and urination by giving orders to the urinary bladder muscles and the muscles of the colon. These orders include the relaxation of the sphincters of the urinary bladder and the increased peristaltic motion of the colon wall. These two actions involve the muscles of these two structures.  , The result is the expulsion of urine from the urinary bladder and the feces from the colon. These two processes are two basic but very important physiological processes that maintain the normal function of the body. Neurological defects in these sensory or motor neurons can lead to problems in performing these two processes. This can have clinical manifestations such as the development of megacolon and the retention of urine in the body. Retention of urine in the body can lead to the accumulation of waste chemicals in the body to toxic levels such as ammonia and creatinine. Also high blood pressure and edema can develop as a result of this. These two basic processes are just one manifestation of the importance of sensory neurons in humans. Also other instinctual needs of the body are very dependent on the intact structure of sensory neurons in the body.  , The ability of humans and animals to see is dependent on sensory neurons in the eyes that are located in the retinal structure of this essential organ. These sensory neurons of the retinal eye are of two types. One is called rods and the other is called cons. These two types of sensory neurons are specialized in converting light waves into electrical signals that propagate through the optic nerve of the eye to the brain stem where they are perceived by other neurons that have synapses with the rods and cons neurons of the retina. This are of the brain is called the geniculate body. From there the signal proceeds through other synaptic neurons into the visual sensory cortex at the posterior part of the brain in humans. This is basically the process that involves the sensation of vision in humans. Other types of sensations in humans include the sensation of hearing and smelling. Both of these two types of sensations have specialized types of neuronal cells that are sensory in its nature.  , Sensory neurons of the ear are located within the inner ear in a structure that is called cochlea. This structure contains a liquid material within it that can lead to the propagation of auditory signals if deformed mechanically. This deformation process can lead to the formation of action potential in the sensory neurons of the inner ear. This in turn can lead to the propagation of hearing sounds that were converted into electrical signals to the brain stem of the brain. In the brain stem specialized auditory sensory neurons synapse with neurons of the inner ear. These neurons in the brain stem in turn synapse with other sensory neurons that terminate in the sensory auditory cortex of the brain in humans. There they are evaluated and perceived as intact sound.  , The sensation of smelling has similar anatomic progress along the sensory neurons of the nervous system of humans. The sensation of smelling is initiated with specialized sensory neurons at the upper side of the inner nose in humans. These sensory neurons are specialized in converting smelling sensations that are usually obtained through the action of special organic chemical compounds on the epithelial neuronal cells of the nose. These chemical compounds induce action potentials in these sensory neurons that initiate and propagate electrical signals into the brain stem of humans brain. There they synapse with other sensory neurons that are located in specialized clusters of neurons that are called nuclei. From there these electrical signals propagate through other synaptic sensory neurons into the specialized area in the cerebral cortex that is specific for the modality of smell sensation.  , In general, all types of sensory neurons in the intact nervous system of humans synapse with other sensory neurons at two basic levels. One of these locations is the spinal cord. The other location of synaptic sensory neurons is the brain stem in humans. The eventual processing of these sensory signals occurs in sensory neurons that are located in specialized areas of the cerebral cortex. This is a general anatomical map of the pathways for the propagation of electrical signals along sensory neurons in the nervous system of humans.  , Similar anatomical pathways are seen with motor neurons with the difference that these motor neurons descend to the spinal cord and the neurons of skeletal muscles instead of ascending to the brain as occurs with the sensory neurons. The other sensations such as heat and cold sensations occur mainly within sensory neurons that are located within the epithelium of the intact skin in humans. These sensory neurons of the skin are very developed neuronal systems that are of different anatomical structures. These sensory neurons contain free nerve endings that can sense and evaluate various modalities of sensations such as pain sensation. Free nerve endings are the main type of receptors for sensory stimuli in the intact nervous system of humans. Similar situations occur in organs of the body that are located within the digestive system for example.  , Internal organs of the body have also specialized sensory neurons that mostly are specialized for the mediation of pain sensation into the brain. This is very important in the case of pathological conditions of these organs of the body. For example pathology of either the kidney or the liver can lead to the sensation of pain. This can occur for example by the stretching of the tissue of the capsules in these two structures.

"['figure out your buying strategy', 'figure out how you will improve a website you buy', 'consider how much you want to pay', 'search for prospective sites to buy', 'do your homework on a prospective purchase', 'strongly consider utilizing escrow if you make an offer', 'take the website for a test drive', 'complete the purchase']",How to Buy a Website," Compare it to buying houses -- do you want to buy a dump for a pittance, spruce it up quickly, and unload it for a smaller but more immediate profit? Or, do you want to buy a nice house with good “bones” but flaws that you can transform into a great house to keep or sell at a larger but longer-term profit? It’s your money, so consider your strategy carefully before you start buying.   If you want to flip websites, you obviously need to buy “low” to have any chance of quickly making a profit. But it isn’t just about seeking out the biggest bargain. That dirt-cheap fixer-upper house may become a condemned money pit before you can flip it if you don’t do your homework first. If you’re looking elsewhere than wikiHow for online advice on flipping websites, keep an eye out, because many advice sites are just sales pitches for an e-book or how-to seminar. Maybe that is something that interests you, but don’t get roped in unwillingly. That said, some of these sales-pitch sites do make good points. For instance, one sensibly compares website buying to billionaire Warren Buffett’s investment strategy -- buy established, good companies (websites) that are undervalued and that you can make better.It’s not always the cheapest or fastest route, but often offers the best return.; , Be realistic about the time and money you can spend to make a site better, your level of familiarity with website design and operation, and your knowledge of the product/service/information offered by a site.   Are you buying with the intent of making money by generating more ad revenue? This is one of the most popular strategies, but make sure you understand Search Engine Optimization (SEO). There is a science (as well as an art) to directing traffic (and thus ad revenue) to a website. Consider buying a site with traffic targeted toward a product or service that you already produce or sell. Use it to complement what you already know and do. You may also have opportunities for streamlining or merging operations as well -- saving money is a way of making money too!Think about buying a site in an underutilized niche. Seek out sites with the potential to have a popular keyword niche for search engines, or sites with built-in communities of members/fans whose support is not being effectively monetized. Such sites offer customer/brand loyalty but have often been haphazardly assembled over time.If you have the skills to build a functional website that will more efficiently draw in traffic and revenue, this may be for you.  , Websites are a buyer’s market with millions of alternatives always available, so be clear on what you are willing and able to invest and do not overpay.Know the timeline you desire for your ROI (Return on Investment) -- that is, how long it will take you to earn back your purchase price. Basically, if you want your ROI within 1 year, don’t pay more than 12 times the monthly net profit of the site (12x). Some advise that a 12x purchase (12 times monthly net profit) is a good deal, 18x is average, and 24x is risky when buying websites., Your main options are, in real estate buying terms, leafing through the “for sale” listings or utilizing a realtor.   Do a keyword search for a business/product/service/field of interest and look deep into the results. Skim over the first couple pages of results, as these are likely to be stable, profitable, not-for-sale or too-expensive sites. Examine sites on later results pages and look for prospects that you think you could make more profitable. No, you don’t know if the site is for sale yet, so you are basically a “cold call” buyer in this method. Search on a website marketplace. The most well-know is probably flippa.com, but there are many options. Such marketplaces list sites for sale by category, price, etc., and often provide analytics and support in the buying/selling process. As with any investment opportunity, take your time and try to sniff out a good deal.  , Once you’ve targeted one or more good-looking prospects, start digging deeper to determine the website’s true viability as an investment.   Contact the seller. Ask for the information you need to know to make an informed opinion, such as site traffic, profit per visitor, monthly profits, purchase/payment methods, trial period possibilities, the possibility for short-term site support post-purchase, etc. Do your own research as well. Trust but verify, as they say. Consider conducting a WHOIS search -- which provides ownership information for a domain name -- on one of many available search platforms. Ask the prospective seller to install Google Analytics on the site and let you access the data personally, so you can make your own assessment of the site’s traffic, etc., An escrow service provides a secure platform for online transactions. Essentially, you will be paying a small percentage fee to have a middleman conduct the transaction between buyer and seller.Your funds are held in escrow until you inspect the website you intend to purchase to ensure that everything is in place and makes the money it claims. If the seller provides the option of escrow, go for it. If not, you may want to insist upon it, especially if you have any doubts about the trustworthiness of the seller. There are alternatives for escrow services for website transactions, but escrow.com is the most well-known.  , This is one major advantage of using an escrow service. They will hold your purchase funds in their own account, which you can release only after you are fully satisfied.   Inspect the website before completing the purchase, even if you are not using an escrow service and need to negotiate your own terms. Ask the seller to verify its earnings. If you get a trial run offered by the seller, that's great. Get your hands on the account. Know it's working!  , Now that the site is yours, don’t waste any time determining how to make it more profitable. But don’t cast aside the seller quite yet, if possible.   Ask the seller if he/she can provide support for a few months, even if you have to pay a small amount it's usually worth it. You can take over earnings more comfortably in this way. Some sellers do provide virtual assistance for a small monthly fee. In short, let the seller handle as much of the transition as you can. Focus your energies on making your new website a money-maker.  ","['prospective sites', 'escrow', 'test drive', 'purchase', 'buying strategy', 'prospective purchase', 'website', 'offer', 'homework']"

Some good band to listen to in order to help you get influence from would be Porkfarm, Internal Suffering, Nile, Origin or Brain Drill. These are some of the most brutal death metal bands out there. Please also check out Disgorge(US) and Dying Fetus, they are also the legends of utilising complex riffs and PH in their riffs. Also, do not confuse Grindcore music with Brutal Death Metal, they are totally different thing too.; ,, They are part of a genre known as ""deathcore"" which, while similar to death metal, it is not the same thing. You must be able to appreciate the music.  , This article is going to focus on guitar specifically. Now, let's get started. You are going to need a guitar meant for death metal in order to play that genre correctly. You do not need an expensive guitar. a decent guitar with good pickups and a decent amp will give you a good enough sound.   Brands you should look for would include Ibanez, Jackson, B.C.Rich, Schecter, ESP, or Dean. If you really want to spice up your tone you can get one of these guitar with EMG pickups.  , In order to play in these low tunings comfortably, you need to have your strings set to a heavy gauge. This basically means that the higher the gauge, the heavier the strings. A good gauge to start on would be 10 gauge. As you get more experienced, you can and must go to higher gauges. The average gauge for the experienced player is usually 12 gauge. REMEMBER, every time you switch to a higher gauge, you MUST have your truss rod adjusted. This is a metal rod in the neck of the guitar that keeps it straight. If your neck is bent improperly, then your guitar will keep going out of tune and prevent you from playing properly. The higher the gauge gets, the more pressure is put upon your guitar neck. You can get this adjusted usually, at any guitar shop, just ask.  , The best brand would be line 6. A good starter amp would be a 15 watt spider 3 line 6 amp. It gives you good distortion for those punch in the face Chuggs and also gives you a good amount of cool effects.  , Watch their techniques and learn their songs. Do not struggle to sound perfect. You Will get better as time passes if you put effort into it. Most people say "" you HAVE TO learn these scales, you MUST know these chords, you HAVE TO learn this before you learn that, blah blah blah..."" well, others say, SELF TAUGHT IS BEST. Just learn as many songs as you can and learn how to play them accurately and you WILL get better and learn many skills. But here are some essential skills:   natural/pinched harmonics palm muting tremolo picking sweep picking tapping alternate picking  Some of these techniques WILL take a while to learn and are quite a challenge.    , Think about everything you hate (the kids who bully you in school, chores that your parents make you do, friends who back stab you, the people who play cruel, mean, awful pranks on you and say the meanest things to you for no reason ) and incorporate it into your riffs. When you come up with enough riffs and get into the habit of it and actually ENJOY the wonderfully art of making music JOIN A BAND! get all of your friends and tell them your plans. its guaranteed that someone will want to play drums, someone will want to do bass, someone will want to play guitar alongside with you, and someone will want to do vocals. if not then look for people. search the internet, or set up fliers around your neighborhood. once you and the guys (or girls) get a couple of songs together start to play somewhere. Play in the subway or at block parties. If you're old enough, play at bars and little public get together places like that.","['interest', 'part', 'music', 'drop c', 'suicide silence', 'bands', 'drop b', 'death metal genre', 'amp', 'idols', 'instrument', 'guitar', 'topic']"

If you don't have a tank top to use as a template, don't worry. You can still make a tank top.; , The shirt does not need to fit well, unless you want a fitted tank top. If the shirt is a brand new shirt, wash and dry it first. Fabric tends to shrink after you wash it the first time, and you want the shirt to be the right size before you start working on it.         , Even if your shirts are already nice and smooth, it might be a good idea to do this. Ironing will smooth the fabric and make it easier to work with.         , Lay the t-shirt flat on a table, then lay the tank top over it. Make sure that the shoulders of the tank top are aligned with the shoulders of the t-shirt. Also, make sure that the front of both shirts is facing upwards.         , Place straight pins all along the edges of the tank top. Take care to pin all the way through all layers of both shirts. This will keep the shirts from moving, and make your cutting more even.         , If you'd like a finished hem around the armholes and neckline, leave a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. A finished hem is not a requirement for t-shirt tank tops, as the fabric does not fray. A finished hem will look nicer, however.          If you don't have a tank top to use as a guide, cut the sleeves and collar off of your t-shirt. Consider folding the shirt in half before cutting it, so that both sides will be even., Take the pins out and put the tank top away. Make sure that the t-shirt is still inside out at this point. You won't be turning it right side out until the very end.         , Some tank tops will have a lower neckline in the front than in the back. The same goes for the armholes. Don't trim too much off, if you plan on having finished hems; remember to leave a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance.         , Fold the edges down by ½-inch (1.27 centimeters). Secure the folds with straight pins, and press them flat with an iron. When folding, make sure that you are folding towards the outside, not the inside.          If you'd like the edges to be raw and un-hemmed, you can skip this step. T-shirts are made from jersey material, which does not fray.  , You can sew by hand or use a sewing machine for more professional, durable stitches.          If you are using a sewing machine, try to use a stitch intended for knit fabrics. It looks like a straight stitch, except that it is broken up by a V every few stitches. When you are done sewing, remember to tie the ends of the threads off into tight knots, and to snip the excess tail ends off.  , The tank top will be a little loose, unless you used a fitted t-shirt or trimmed the sides down.

Throw these items in the washer to remove any dirt or dust.; , Make a daily inspection to find and remove any mold or mildew that may be accumulating in your child's space. These elements can make their allergies worse. Check for mold and mildew in areas that are often wet, such as the bathroom. Check the windows in your child's room for mold spots as well as any areas on the ceiling.The best way to get rid of mold and mildew is by using chlorine cleaners. Bring in professionals to remove and repair the sources of significant or recurring mold accumulations.  , Clean the carpets in your child’s room and your home on a weekly basis by vacuuming them. Carpet can hold in allergens that can make your child’s symptoms worse, such as dust mites and pet dander.You should also get the habit of wiping off dust on window sills and shelves on a regular basis so your child is not exposed to this allergen. If possible remove carpet and install hardwood floors that don’t accumulate allergens and easier to clean than carpet.  , If you have dogs or cats at home, try to keep them out of your child’s space. Pets carry dander that can make your child’s allergies worse. You may get in the habit of keeping your child’s door closed during the day so the pets cannot get in there. Or you may create a fenced off area so your pets cannot get into other rooms in your home.You should also get in the habit of keeping the windows in your child’s room closed. This will prevent airborne allergens from getting into their room as well as any pets that may be outside.  , You can soothe a child with a runny or congested nose by adding moisture to the air with a humidifier. Set up a humidifier in their room so moisture can circulate in their space and reduce their allergy symptoms. You can find humidifiers online or at your local hardware store.Make sure you clean the filter in the humidifier on a regular basis, following the directions on the label otherwise you can make your child’s allergies worse. If you cannot afford to buy a humidifier, use your bathroom shower to add moisture to the air. Turn on the shower to hot and let the room fill up with steam. Keep the door closed. Then, go into the bathroom with your child and sit in there with them for 15 minutes. Do this for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night to help clear out your child’s nasal passages., To make sure your child is getting fresh, clear air indoors, you can get an air purifier. Breathing in air free of allergens can soothe your child’s symptoms. Put the air purifier in their bedroom or have several throughout the house so the air is clean indoors. You can find air purifiers that can actually filter out pollen, dust, and bacteria in the air so your home is free of allergens.You can buy air purifiers online or at your local hardware store. Look for air purifiers that are designed to filter out allergens in the air.  ","['mildew', 'bed sheets', 'humidifier', 'room', 'air purifier', 'child', 'pets', 'mold', 'environment', 'dust']"
"['learn the four mental states of a successful tennis player', 'forget about winning', 'forget about what has happened in the previous point and focus on your next shot', 'focus on hitting the ball', 'change your mindset', ""don't try to always hit the winner"", 'believe in yourself', ""don't think about hitting the ball""]",How to Practice Zen Tennis," Mental fitness is as important as physical fitness in tennis. Focusing on these states and practicing ways to improve your mental focus should form a part of your regular training. The four essential mental states are:Concentration - staying in the present Commitment - you must maintain both drive and stamina Control - not only of the ball and racquet, but also over your emotions and behaviour, including your reaction to bad weather, broken racquets, bad line calls, snapped nets, noisy crowds, etc. Confidence - your certain belief that you can manage anything on the court.; , Winning will come from better aligned focus, and getting the basics right. How can you get the basics right if you spend your time focusing on winning the point instead of focusing on hitting the ball?   Think of your concentration level as a limited bucket. If use up your concentration on trying to win, hitting a winner or the previous point you lost or won, then you have less concentration to spend on hitting that next ball. This leads to more unforced errors.  , Tennis is a short game when you think about it, and many players dwell on how they should have won that last point, what they did wrong, or how to win the next point. This takes away from your concentration bucket and causes more unforced errors.  , By enjoying each point, and focusing on the enjoyment each strike brings, you will naturally focus on the ball.   Keep your eye on the ball. This is the key to good tennis, and you will naturally hit better shots.  , Instead of trying to win the point, try thinking about how to make the rally longer. After all, you are here to play tennis and the enjoyment it brings should be at the forefront of the game's purpose. By trying to make the point longer, you will distract yourself from focusing on winning the point, and instead point that focus on hitting the ball correctly. After all, to make the point last longer, you need to hit more balls in, which means you need to focus on the ball and hitting it correctly.  , If the opportunity presents itself then take it, but do not force the winner. By looking for winners, you are taking away from your concentration bucket, leaving less for focusing on the ball.  , When you start losing, don't step back and start playing like a weak player. Know that you have done this before and that you can play at this level. Most of the time you will start to focus on how many points you have lost, and how poorly you are playing. This will take away from your concentration bucket, and leave you with nothing to hit the ball with.  , Substitute an enjoyment of guiding the ball to its desired location. When you guide the ball, your concentration becomes focused on the ball, rather than on you. Your strokes will become naturally longer with the correct follow through, and power will come when you learn to co-ordinate the ball directly onto the sweet spot. You'll find your stamina is increased as you get less tired hitting the ball, because you are letting the racquet do the work.

Ask those in your neighborhood or family friends at even the slightest mention of a vacation or being too busy to walk the dog. And when you do it once successfully, you'll likely be asked to do it again.   Mention to your new network that you're considering making this a career, so if they could drop any of their other soon-to-be-departing or dog-owning friends of your interest, that'd be great! Right now is the time for shameless advertisement. In time, you won't have to do it at all. This stage is all about building up a reputation. Whatever you do, don't risk damaging it by abusing your powers. Having the key to someone's home is a serious gesture of trust -- be as responsible to your new clients as you would yourself, your grandma, or the President. That means no throwing parties, no forgetting to feed the dog, and no raiding the refrigerator (unless they allow it, of course).; , Point blank, the easiest way to start making money walking dogs is to join an agency. Sure, they'll take a cut of the money that's charged, but you'll get experience and they'll handle the legal mumbo jumbo. Whether the agency is for pet sitting or walking, join. It's a simple Google search away.   The only downfall of this is that you're not your own boss. Relax -- that can come with time. But right now you're meeting people, networking, learning the ropes, and getting a feel for the dog walking market, not to mention beefing up your resume. Joining an agency is not an absolute, 100% must-do. You can get around it by building up your dog-walking network yourself. However, it's a lot easier to get experience and clients (and meet other people with acumen in the dog-walking business) if you join an agency.  , Obtaining a dog handling certification would build some serious credibility with clients. Some schools, such as the Canine Club Academy, offer full-tuition scholarships.And the best agencies may even require you to obtain it, either before becoming a full-time employee or after hiring.   Certain academies, like DogTec, will help you in starting your own business too (if that interests you) in addition to dog handling and protocol. Their classes last 4 days and are in locations all across the US and British Columbia., First off, you've gotta know what your city's laws are when it comes to canines and their walkers. Some cities require dog walkers to be insured; if you're working with an agency, hopefully they took care of that for you. But if you're thinking about doing it on your own time, it's something not to be taken lightly.   Get to know your city's layout, too. The less you're driving around wasting money on gas, the better. Know the parks, the hidden hideaway spots, the dog parks, and back trails you can frolic with your new furry friend. You want to spend as little time commuting and as much time ""working"" as possible.  , It may seem like dog walking is the perfect career for a surefire introvert, but the humans are where your bread and butter is. Make small chat with the doormen, the guy who works from home, and your coworkers and bosses. The better rep you have, the more professional contacts you'll have in the future.   In addition, realize that your human clients will have all sorts of expectations, based on their own beliefs in dog-care and often with a dose of guilt that they can't spare the time to do what you are doing for them. Be generous in your compassion for their concerns (after all, they know their own pooch best) and be tolerant of the more difficult requests. Gentle persuasion and negotiation will often win the human client over!  , You need to love dogs to have a successful career with dogs. It is as simple as that. Dogs sense non-dog people and it won't be smooth riding if you aren't truly comfortable around them. There are some important considerations to think about:   Do you know as much as possible about dogs? Know as much as you can, not just from your own experience with them but also from reading and speaking to the owners and to your local vet. How many dogs will you walk at any one time? Some dog-walkers can walk as many as ten dogs at once, all shapes and sizes. Consider whether you think this is a good thing or even achievable for you!       Do you know which breeds of dogs might not be compatible or will be compatible with one another? Know this before teaming them up for a walk. Do you know what to do if a dog is in heat? It'll attract more than its fair share of attention and you'll need to be prepared. Do you know how to handle a dog that suddenly turns aggressive on you? Or on passers-by around you? Do you know how to poop-scoop? Do you know the local by-laws on walking dogs in certain areas etc? Read up! Your being well-informed will impress clients and will reassure them that you are not amateur and will help them to feel you are going to have their dog's best interests at heart.  , While it may sound like a dream come true (and it very well could be), not all dog walking is a glitzy, paid way to gallivant the sidewalks. You'll be dealing with poo in its very literal sense, in addition to ornery owners, ornery dogs, and ornery pedestrians. Are you ready?   You'll also need to consider your climate. If this is going to be your main source of income, can you dog walk in the winter months? How do you feel about rain? If you're ready to tackle the less than stellar climes, be prepared! Boots, rain jacket, snow gear -- and maybe some for the pooch, too.  , Being relatively fit is obviously a necessity to dog walking for a living. If you find that you get tired after a dog or two, use your free time to get in shape. Adding cardio (swimming, walking, tennis) to your list of activities will make the hours spent trotting along with Fido much more enjoyable.   Get a good pair of shoes. When you're on the job, you'll probably be on your feet for hours on end. You don't have to go running triathlons to get accustomed to it, but it is a good idea to get a nice pair of shoes so you don't go home every night crawling on all fours like FrouFrou over here. A decent pair will make the new physical stressors much more manageable.  , Be realistic - you'll probably need to start small, and allow yourself time to grow. Do you want it to be a part time or a full-time career? How much time can you devote to dog-walking? If you are young and want to make money by dog walking, make flyers and offer around your neighborhood, or put up notices on notice boards or in shop windows. For example, consider these scenarios:   If you are a student who needs income during studies, you will have crunch times around exams and essay due dates but you will likely be fairly flexible during the rest of the time. Be honest with a potential client and explain your availability, including the possibility that there may be certain times when you will be very busy and may need to reschedule temporarily at such times. Always let them know you'll make up for it during vacation etc. If you want to start a permanent business, consider whether it is something you want to work 9 - 5 (or extended hours) 5 - 7 days a week, or is it something that only interests you part-time, say 2 - 3 days a week of a few hours here and there? These are important considerations that will either expand or limit your options and availability. More hours means more clients and a likelihood of referrals. Less hours will mean more devotion to a small corps of clients and a need to make it clear to them that your availability is limited to them.  , If you have no business past, it's more than just a good idea to take some classes and get your feet wet. Enlist the help of others that have a good grasp on the endeavor, can get you through the red tape, and form a solid business plan. If you want a large business, are you prepared to manage employees and cover a larger part of the city than you could do alone? Instead of just you, you'll be taking care of an entire team. You will need to:   Get insurance and become bonded. Interview pet sitters, check them for reliability, train them and pay them. Be able to trust them to do their dog-walking according to your instructions. Keep good financial records, manage a payroll system, pay taxes on business income, and manage other worker's requirements. Keep a tight leash (no pun intended) on the client arrangements. As owner of the business, you should make all arrangements for dog-walking directly with clients and then provide the instructions, keys etc. to your employees. That way, if things don't work out with your dog-walker employee, you keep the client and substitute with a new employee.  , How you price your services will depend on the quality of your service and the length of time you have been dog-walking professionally. It will be difficult to charge higher amounts until word-of-mouth begins to boost your business and you have solid references.   Research the field first. What are other dog-walkers charging in your area? Ask them if they are willing to divulge information to a potential competitor. Compete fairly with them - you could undercut slightly at first to get a toehold in the business. Don't undercut viciously; after all, you want to stay in this industry, not be cold-shouldered by your fellow dog-walkers. If there is no one competing, then use the internet to get some idea of the costs for your region. Don't under-charge or over-charge. Undercharging will lead some to think you are an amateur, perhaps even the local school kids looking for odd jobs. Charge a fair amount in return for good, reliable and professional services.  , Make sure that they present a professional image and provide your contact details. Include a few short, pithy lines or words about what you offer as part of the dog-walking service. For instance:   Say where the dogs will be walked - for example, to the parks, on green grass, in quieter areas of the city - whatever you think dog-owners would appreciate and trust. Explain what you will do with the dogs to keep them entertained and well-exercised - for example, that you are prepared to run with the dogs for exercise, that you will play ball/tug rope/fetch with the dogs etc. The ways in which you will pay attention to nutritional and medical requirements of your canine charges.  , Pass around flyers or business cards to let people know about your business. Stop residents walking their dogs as you walk around, introduce yourself and offer your business card to them. Begin to network with family and friends regarding your business. Start small and let your good business spread by word-of-mouth.   There is no harm in asking your first set of clients to refer you to their friends, colleagues, etc. If they are happy with your work, many will be happy to do this. If you've built up relationships with people from past clients (security guards, doormen, maids), they may be a potential hot bed of business, too. Bid on keywords on Google's Adwords program, and purchase paid directory listings on dog walker directories and other websites. Hit up Craigslist, Facebook, and even veterinary bulletin boards.  , The internet is increasingly becoming people's first port of call and aids them in their decision making. When choosing your domain name keep it simple by choosing a domain with relevant keywords (so your website appears on the first page of Google).   Consider the layout and design. First impressions count and if your website is a reflection upon your service it should depict your core values (such as friendliness and professionalism) and what you have to offer. Enhance it with images or even a video so people can get a real feel for you and your service. Consider a website that allows users to book a time slot and services online. Some customers prefer to book online rather than over the phone.  If you don't know the first thing about making a website, odds are you know half a dozen people who do. So ask!    , People looking for dog walkers have often just gotten a puppy and are looking for tips on training. New dog owners are also interested in learning about dog health, local parks, and pet organizations. If you can be a vital source of information (cue Lori Beth Denberg) for them, they'll likely keep you around.   Join a professional organization or two that can keep you on the up-and-up when it comes to doggy care. The International Association of Canine Professionals and the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters are two good places to start.When they ask where you learned that tidbit of info from, you just respond, ""Oh, you know. I've been a member of IACP for a while now.""  , It might be worthwhile adding other dog-services to your skill set. While these additional services will also add costs and some may even require business or home-office style space, if you are seriously considering making an entire career from dogs and their care, this may be the key to a lucrative career. Consider extra services such as:   Dog-bathing and dog-grooming  Dog-sitting (either on client's premises or at yours if you have space for boarding kennels) Dog-training and/or dog-listening (if you are properly qualified only) Spending extra time after the walk at client's home with a dog to simply be with it, play with it, feed it etc; and  Dog medical attention - some owners can't stay home from work to medicate their dogs; you could be the answer.  , Ask at a local veterinary clinic for some training in basic dog first-aid (expect to pay the vet for this advice). It will help you to fix some of the little problems that you may encounter. And while you're at this, do you know the first-aid for a dog bite?   Your local Humane Society may be another resource you can tap into. If a veterinarian seems a bit hard to get work in with, the staff here may be a useful alternative. And you could help out pups that need love.

In a gestational surrogacy, an egg and sperm join to form an embryo. This embryo is then implanted into the woman who will carry and bear the child. With a gestational pregnancy, the surrogate is not a biological parent of the child.With a traditional surrogacy, the surrogate is impregnated through artificial insemination. In other words, the donor’s sperm fertilizes the surrogate’s egg. In this situation, the surrogate is also the biological mother of the child.Both types of surrogacy are allowed in the state of Florida provided the surrogacy contract comports with the state statute.; , Florida has two statutes that cover surrogacy: one for traditional (or genetic) surrogacy and one for gestational surrogacy. You should read the Florida statutes so that you understand what is required of surrogates and what is allowed or disallowed as part of a surrogacy contract.   The applicable statutes are available at this attorney’s website.  , In Florida, it is illegal to pay a fee for a child. In fact, paying or receiving fees that are unrelated to the pregnancy may be a criminal offense. However, certain surrogacy expenses related to the pregnancy can be compensated. You can be reasonably compensated for the following expenses:legal medical psychological or psychiatric living expenses wages lost due to the pregnancy inconvenience, discomfort, and medical risk  , If you haven’t been pregnant before, then you should try to read up as much as possible on how pregnancy will affect your life. This impact includes time missed from work for appointments with the obstetrician or for childbirth. Even if you have had normal pregnancies in the past, you may encounter complications, which could result in hospitalization or bed rest.   Also, think about how attached you might become to the child. Many women grow very attached to a child that they have nurtured in the womb for nine months. Giving that child up can be emotionally challenging. At the same time, backing out of your surrogacy contract could be stressful and emotionally taxing on the intended parents as well. You should think carefully before deciding to become a surrogate. If you have children, you should also consider how the pregnancy will affect them.Think about how you will explain to your children that the child you are carrying will not be returning home with you after you go to the hospital for delivery.  , In Florida, you cannot advertise your services as a surrogate. Instead, you must work through either an attorney or an agency. An attorney can be invaluable throughout the entire surrogacy process, so you may want to think about hiring one even if you decide to carry for friends or family or work through an established agency.   Visit wikiHow’s How to Find a Good Family Law Attorney for tips on how to find an experienced family law attorney. Ideally, you should hire an attorney who has experience with surrogacy. You can check the directory of the American Academy of Assisted Reproductive Technology Attorneys, which is a national organization of attorneys dedicated to advancing best legal practices with respect to assisted reproductive technology. Check the directory at their website for attorneys in Florida.  , Often, surrogates carry a child for couples they have known for many years. Sometimes, they are even family. If you have been approached by a friend or family member about acting as a surrogate, then you should think over how comfortable you would be birthing a child that you will probably see regularly.  , You can also find prospective parents through an agency. The state does not maintain a centralized directory of surrogacy agencies. Instead, you should search for them online, by searching for “surrogacy center” and your state or county. Agencies may have detailed requirements that you must meet in order to become a surrogate. For example, they may require that you:   be a U.S citizen or permanent resident currently living in the United States be a non-smoker and be physically, medically, and mentally healthy be between 20 and 42 years of age have already given birth via a healthy pregnancy to a healthy child  , Before becoming a surrogate, you should attempt to find out as much as you can about either the intended parents or the agency as possible. A surrogacy contract is a written agreement and can become the basis of litigation. You should know who you are entering a contract with.   If you are working with an agency, check the Better Business Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce in the area where the agency is located. You may also want to check with the Florida Attorney General to see if any lawsuits have been filed against the agency by the state or other parties. You should also do your own investigation of the intended parents, even if the agency does its own investigation. For tips on how to do a basic background check, see wikiHow’s How to Do a Criminal Background Check.  , You will need to sit down and come to an agreement with the intended parents about a variety of issues. In addition to compensation, you should be sure to come to agreement on the following before drafting a contract:   All parties should agree on what optional testing should be performed (such as amniocentesis) and when it should be done. All parties should agree with what will be done in the case of a complication or birth defect. Discuss the maximum number of attempts to achieve pregnancy.Decide whether or not you must use particular doctors or clinics chosen by the intended parents.  , If you decide to work through an agency, then the agency should have its own contracts. Because surrogacy contracts are so complicated, you should work with the agency’s contract, suggesting additions or deletions.   If you decide to carry for friends or family, then you should each have an attorney. Florida law requires that each party have a different attorney, so that there will not be a conflict of interest.Florida law also allows your legal expenses to be paid by the intended parents. Accordingly, you should not be without an attorney because it is too expensive.  , Make sure that everything has been included that you and the intended parents have reached agreement on. Also ask your lawyer if he or she can think of anything else that should be included.   You should give your lawyer a couple weeks at least to review the contract. If you need more time, then tell the intended parents that you are waiting to hear from your attorney.  , You should never sign a contract unless you fully agree with everything within its four corners. If something has been left out of the contract, or if there are terms written into the contract that you disagree with, then you should take the time to speak to the intended parents or the agency about it.   Sometimes, oral promises are made that are not reflected in the contract. For example, a contract may not have a provision explaining who will pay for an amniocentesis test. The intended parents may say, “Oh don’t worry, we’ll pay. Just send us the bill.” However, problems can arise if you have a dispute as to who should pay. A court may or may not find an oral side agreement valid. Accordingly, make sure the contract contains all relevant terms.  , If you undertake a traditional surrogacy, then you will need to consent to terminating your parental rights. This requirement only applies in a traditional surrogacy.   Under Florida law, you can rescind your consent within 48 hours of birth., Once you have become impregnated, then you should follow the contract. A failure to follow the contract could open you up to a lawsuit filed by either the intended parents or the surrogacy agency. If any unforeseen complications arise in the pregnancy which were not dealt with in the contract, then you should speak to your lawyer and raise the issue with the intended parents.

Maybe you're texting him often, or you've been calling three times an hour for the past three hours. Understand that guys generally appreciate their space and not having to be with you 24/7.; , There are a lot of very authentic reasons that might seem as if he is ""ignoring"" you, but actually, have nothing to do with you.   He may be busy. You may have the habit of talking daily, then suddenly it stops, and you urgently want to chat. It has been a day, but you're frantic. And he, well he is very busy! When he's busy, you can expect him to cut off the communications until the task is done. He doesn't feel well. He has been trying to deal with a head cold, a shoulder pain or a stomach ache. Being the stoic that he is, he has only stopped replying because he doesn't want to burden you with his pain or let on that he doesn't even feel so great. He is tired. Genuinely, pooped. He just wants a bit of space to recover his lost energy, so he's withdrawing for a week of snooze catch-up. He has experienced a family issue. He is uncomfortable talking to you about it because he has issues with his crazy/possessive/insane/angry/moralizing/whatever family and it's just all too hard to go into the gritty details. He'd rather you didn't get involved because once you are, awful entanglements will ensue. This can be a very protective stance, both ways. He has hit a snag at work. The deadline is looming, the boss is breathing down his neck, the job's future is precarious. He's salvaging what is left of his work opportunity, and you are suddenly a distraction.  , If you think that you might have been a bit too ""full on"", try pulling back for a while and giving him back the space that you've tried to inhabit. This doesn't mean withdrawing affection or not seeing him at all; it just means learning to pace yourself and take it easy.   Don't text or call him for an entire day. Try to stick with it. If he hasn't reached out to you at all during that day, talk with him about what he expects out of a relationship. If you expect something that he won't give you, you may want to look elsewhere for a boyfriend. Don't text or call him about pointless things. Don't call him just because Mindy broke up with Seth when your boyfriend doesn't know either of those people. You may think it's important, but he probably doesn't.  , Getting sad and emotional about it just lowers your appeal and may be the goal of some chauvinistic men. Be happy and smile more. Your days will not be hindered by the fact that he is ignoring you. The happier you are, the more he'll want to feed off that happiness.  , Ask him if he's ignoring you for any particular reason. Did you bother him? Did you accidentally say something? If he's acting strangely for a particular reason, you'll want to know why so that you don't risk doing it again.   If he tells you he just needs more space, figure out if you can live with that. If you're the kind of person who wants a complete partnership with your boyfriend, and that sort of space is going to be hard for you to deal with, things might not work out.  , As noted earlier, there can be any number of reasons why your boyfriend might be ignoring you. However, it's possible that he isn't answering because he doesn't think that the things you say are important; he sees your nattering as idle chatter, stuff that doesn't earn a reply or lead to a discussion. Learn to talk to him on his level, and he'll be interested in no time; or, leave the celebrity gossip and hair and nails stuff for the girls.   Talk to him about his passions. Maybe it's sports; maybe it's racing, maybe it's chemistry. It could be anything. Talk about what he likes to do and be excited about his passions. Every boy has a passion; you just have to find it. Ask him questions about the things he likes. Ask him why he likes what he likes. Ask him to explain his favorite hobby, and how he first got interested in it. If you're excited about something he's excited about, he won't be able to ignore you. Don't interrupt him when he's on a roll. When he's all excited about something, let him keep talking. Don't interrupt when he's got momentum.  , Tell him that you want to go on a date, and hopefully, he'll get the hint that you want him to set it up. If he doesn't get the hint, then you might have to figure it out yourself. It'll be a small price to pay if the date goes well.   Remember to do something that he enjoys. Shopping might be something you'd do all day long if you had the chance, but it's probably not his idea of a great date. See if you can go to an amusement park, the movies, a performance of a band he likes, etc. Dress your best, put a smile on your face, and wear your hair just the way he likes it. Sometimes, all a guy will need is a little wake-up call that his girl is the prettiest girl on the block. That should shake his funk up. Try to focus on good stuff during the date. Keep him engaged. Ask him questions. Be playful, warm-hearted, and optimistic. Give him a chance to make everything better, and remind him of why he's your boyfriend in the first place. If the date doesn't go well, tell him that you hoped the date would be an opportunity to connect and that you worry you just aren't connecting in the way you used to. If he still doesn't seem to care, he doesn't deserve another shot.  , If he thinks he can get away with ignoring you after your attempts to turn things around, and you let him, then he is getting away with ignoring you. If you demand respect from him, telling him what you will and won't stand for, he won't have any other option.   Tell him how you feel. Tell him you need better communication, and that you'll try to communicate better too. Tell him if the communication doesn't get better, you might have to consider calling it quits. If he loves you and respects you, he'll change in an instant. If he doesn't love you and doesn't respect you, why would you want to be with him?  , Go hang out with your friends and guy friends. Make sure he understands that you have a life, too and that he's lucky you're including him in it.   Most guys will immediately come running back and stop ignoring you, especially if you're hanging out with other guys. They'll get territorial. It's just how guys work. If he doesn't come back to you and keeps ignoring you, ask yourself if you want the relationship you're getting. One hundred percent effort from someone else is probably better than 50 percent effort from him.  , Of course, it helps to have proof: You don't want to break up with him just because you have a ""feeling."" But if stuff doesn't feel right, have a talk and figure out what's wrong. If nothing is wrong, and that's just how things are, then you probably want to start looking for a new boyfriend, because things just aren't working for you two.

Thoroughly clean and sanitize everything that is going to come in contact with your beer. The easiest way to do that is to use an electric dishwasher set at the high heat setting or use a powdered cleanser such as PBW (Powdered Brewery Wash).          Do not use a scrubber that will scratch the surface of whatever you're scrubbing—pathogens love to grow in the grooves left behind, and they're almost impossible to sanitize. Rinse well, then soak briefly in a bleach or iodine solution.; , Rinse off bleach before using items using very clean potable or distilled water. Do not assume tap water is sanitized for rinsing brewing equipment.    If you're using bleach to sanitize, add one ounce (30ml) of bleach to five gallons (19 liters) of cold water, followed by one ounce (30ml) of white vinegar. Do not mix the bleach and vinegar together before adding to the water! The vinegar will make the water more acidic, which helps the bleach sanitize. Do not rinse iodine solutions, let equipment drip dry instead. Note that bleach can cause unwanted flavours in your beer, and requires rinsing, which can introduce microorganisms to your sterilized equipment. If you want to sterilize your equipment properly, use either a food-grade cleanser or sanitizer such as One Step No-Rinse Sanitizer, which requires no rinsing; or an iodine solution such as BTF Iodophor. Remember, in beer brewing, you can do just about anything you want, and add anything you want, to make whatever kind of beer you want—but proper sanitizing is the MOST important thing you can do. Take the time and the energy to do it right.  , That includes cleaning and sanitizing as outlined, and also includes having all your ingredients prepared and measured in advance.   , Before you begin your foray into home brewing, get a notebook, and note down everything you do—the cleaning process, what strain of yeast, the amount and specific type of malt, what variety of hops, and any specialty grains or other ingredients used to produce your beer.    This will allow you to reproduce any given brew, or provide a basis for experimentation and improvement.  , Put any specialty grains into a grain bag (a mesh bag to contain the grains—like a tea bag, only a lot bigger) and steep them in the large stock pot in three gallons (10 liters) of hot water (around 150°F (66°C) for about 30 minutes.            Remove the grains and allow the water to drip out of the grain bag, into the pot. Do not squeeze the bag, because you may extract tannins that will give your beer an astringent flavor.  , The hops are usually added at various intervals to add flavor, bitterness, or aroma and the times will be spelled out for you in the kit's instructions for your style of beer.            In general, hops added early in the boil will contribute more bitterness, but at the expense of flavor and aroma. Hops added at the end of the boil will have a more pronounced flavor and aroma, but will not contribute significantly to the bitterness of the beer.  , After you have boiled the liquid (called wort—pronounced wərt), you need to cool it as quickly as possible. The easiest way is to put the whole pot in a sink or bathtub that is filled with ice water.            You can gently stir the wort to help expedite the cooling, but try not to splash or aerate the wort while it's still hot (it can make for some funky flavors). Once it's around 80°F (27°C) you are ready to transfer it to the fermenter.  , After the wort has cooled and before fermentation starts is the one and only time that splashing is encouraged. Yeast need oxygen, and splashing the wort as you pour it into the fermenter will deliver that.            Once fermentation has started, you want to minimize exposure to air, as it will lead to off flavors and aromas. Using a large strainer (usually cheapest at restaurant supply stores), scoop the hops out—you've already got all the good stuff out of them. (If using a carboy, strain the wort as you pour it into the carboy). Add water to make five gallons (20 liters). You are now ready to ""pitch"" (add) the yeast. Some yeast requires that you ""bloom"" (stir with warm water to activate) them prior to pitching, others do not. You may find that even those that don't require blooming will start working faster if you do bloom them first, but it's usually no big deal. Put the lid on your fermenter (or stopper in your glass carboy) and affix the air-lock to the top. Put the fermenter in a dark area that stays a fairly consistent room temperature (for ales...lagers need refrigeration to ferment properly). In about 24 hours, you should notice the air-lock happily bubbling away, if it hasn't started doing anything after 48 hours, you might have a problem such as dead yeast.  , After a week or so, the activity from the airlock will slow to a crawl. Leave it alone for two weeks measured from the time you first started the brewing/fermenting. The beer is now ready for bottling. Your kit probably came with some priming sugar or DME(dried malt extract). This is used to provide carbonation to your beer once it is in the bottle.            Boil the sugar in a little water and cool it. Then, add it to the empty, cleaned and sanitized bucket with the spigot or to your fermented beer.  , Use your cleaned and sanitized plastic tubing as a siphon to transfer the beer as gently as possible—so that there's little or no aeration—from the fermenter to the bottling bucket with the priming sugar solution in it. Try not to get any of the sediment (trub) from the fermenter into the bottling bucket.            Attach your cleaned and sanitized bottle filler to your clean and sanitized plastic tubing, the other end of the tubing attaches to the bottom end of the spigot. (If you are only using one bucket, it is important to let the fermented beer settle after stirring in the priming sugar solution. There is sediment on the bottom (trub) that will lend an off flavor to your beer).  , If you are using a bottling bucket, just open the spigot and put the bottle filler in a bottle. Push the bottle filler to the bottom and that will let the beer flow.            If using the one bucket method, fill the tube (attached to the bottle filler) with water and put the open end in the fermented beer and place the bottle filler in a glass, or a bottle or the sink, press down to let the water flow out and start the beer flowing in the tube like a siphon. Fill each bottle just to overflowing, then remove the bottle filler: this leaves an almost perfect airspace at the top of the bottle. Cap the bottle with your handy bottle capper, and repeat until all the bottles are full.  , Store the bottles for at least a week preferably two at about room temperature, then refrigerate.   , When you're ready, open a bottle, and pour carefully into a glass. Leave about a quarter inch in the bottle—the sediment tastes a little yeasty, and will give you serious beer farts.           ,","['grains', 'notes', 'wort', 'everything', 'briefly', 'malt extract', 'bottles', 'boil', 'fermenter', 'brew']"

One side of your body should not be higher the than the other, and your weight should be evenly distributed.; , The supporting leg is the leg that says on the ground throughout the position. Do not turn out more than is comfortable or more than your hip allows.  , Shift your weight to the ball of your foot on your supporting leg. Your supporting leg should now be perpendicular to the floor.  , Your working leg is the leg that you will raise for the position. Straighten out and lengthen your working leg with the top of the foot flat on the floor behind you., Keep your shoulders and rib cage square with your hips. With one hand, hold onto a barre or chair for stability and balance, and lift your chest up and out.  , Balance on your supporting leg, feeling it stretch into the floor, and slowly lift your working leg behind you.   Be sure to straighten the knee of your working leg and point your toes. Typically, the working leg sweeps out to a 45 or 90 degree angle, but if you are just beginning, don’t force your body into this position. Only raise your working leg as high as you are able while still maintaining a strong upper body.  , Still holding onto the barre, lean forward at the hips and engage your abdominal muscles. This movement mimics that of a hinge.   Remember to keep your supporting leg turned out.Elongate your spine and keep your chest lifted.  , Lower your working leg to the floor with the top of the foot flat to the floor. Straighten your upper body at hips and square your hips and shoulders to begin the position again.  , Before you start stretching cold muscles, warm up your entire body and increase your heart rate by jogging in place or taking a brisk walk. Jog or walk for about ten minutes, long enough to break into a light sweat.  , Reach your arms up above your head. Bend slightly at the waist to the front, side-to-side, and to the back in one fluid and controlled motion. Try this warm up with both legs on the ground. Then challenge yourself and improve your stability by repeating the exercise on one leg., Stand up straight and swing both arms in large circles, keeping the motion slow and controlled. While swinging your arms, gently twist back and forth at the waist.  , Lie on your back with your arms at your sides. Swing your legs up and down, alternating between your left and right leg. Your motions should be fluid and controlled.  , Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Bend forward, stretch out your arms, and reach for your toes.   Reach until you feel a slight muscle burn on the back of your thighs and calves. Hold this position for 30 seconds. If you can’t reach your toes, don’t force your body into the position. Repeat this stretch daily, gradually working toward reaching your toes.  , Since the Arabesque requires your back muscles to be engaged throughout the position, a stiff back can make your Arabesque flat.Rotate your torso, swinging your arms gently from side-to-side. Switch from swinging your arms to gently swinging your legs back and forth, alternating between right and left. Use a foam roller or pilates ball to ease tension from you back. Lie face up with a roller or ball under your upper back. Arms and head relaxing on the floor. Allow your body to sink into this position and hold for a minute.

On the right side of the page, click on the Try It button. You can get a 30-day, fully-functioning trial to see if Photoshop is right for you.; , Command+ click (Windows:Ctrl+click) here to open a sample picture in a new tab. You can use to follow along with this tutorial. Drag the photo to the desktop, then open up that image in Photoshop.   When you're done, your screen should look something like this:       , You can do this by clicking on the icon, or by typing the letter M. (For the remainder of this tutorial, the key shortcut will be shown after the tool name.) The Marquee tool is the most basic of all tools. It's something you're already familiar with: virtually every application and operating system selects things the same way: click and drag to select a region of the screen. Photoshop is no different.   Clicking and holding on the Marquee icon will give you a small popup menu where you can select the variations: Rectangular marquee (the default); Elliptical marquee, for selecting circles and ovals; and a single-pixel marquee for both horizontal and vertical. For now, select the Rectangular marquee, place your cursor somewhere in the upper left of the image, then click and drag the mouse. You will see the selection expand, with the pixel values to the right of the selection. Drag towards the center, until the values are roughly W: 300 H: 200, then release the mouse button. Click and hold in the middle of the selection, and move the cursor—notice how the selection moves with you. Drag the selection so that it surrounds the tan house on the hill, as shown:      From here, you can copy the selection, move it, apply filters to it—pretty much anything you can do in Photoshop starts with a selection.       , Closely related to the Marquee tool is the Lasso tool. Like the Marquee tool, the Lasso is used to make a selection. However, with the Lasso tool, you can make a freeform selections. Its variants include the Polygonal Lasso tool, and the Magnetic Lasso tool. Select the basic Lasso tool, and try it out.   Click and hold the mouse button, then draw a selection around the small white sailboat that's left of center in the window. When you get to the bottom, release the mouse button—the selection will auto-complete. Now press Command-D (Control-D on a PC). This will deactivate the selection. Note that this works for all selections. Press Shift-L. This will change the cursor to the Polygonal Lasso Tool. (Shift plus the tool shortcut will cycle through the other related tools). Notice the black arrow on the top left of the Polygonal Lasso cursor: that's where the click point is. Click once, anywhere on the image. Notice as you move your mouse, the starting point remains pinned, and a dashed line extends towards the cursor. Click again, and that next point becomes pinned. You can continue clicking until your selection is complete: as simple as a triangle, or as complex as you like. When you reach your last click point, double click instead of single click, and the polygon will automatically close.      Press the Escape key at any time to cancel the selection in progress. Press Shift-L again. This selects the Magnetic Lasso. Like the lasso tools, the click point is the black pointer in the upper left of the cursor. Try this: click and hold the mouse button with the cursor pointing at the water line of the bow (front) of the boat, and drag around the boat slowly. Notice as you drag, the selection actually snaps to the boat as you move! At the top of the Photoshop window, you'll see some tool modifiers: Feather, Anti-alias, Width, Contrast, and Frequency. As you advance, try each of these and see what effect they have on your selections. Hover over any interface element to see tool tips for that particular tool or setting.       , This is the advanced version of the Magic Wand tool (which is still available as an alternate tool).   Try this: click and hold on the tan house in the middle of the picture. While holding the mouse, drag to the left or the right, ""scrubbing"" the house with the cursor. Notice how the selection grows as you do this. Make sure you select the roof, balcony, and all the rest of the house is selected. When done, you may notice that some of the shrubbery is selected, too:      There are two ways to eliminate the shrubbery with the Quick Selection tool. The first is to select the Subtract version of the tool.      The other way to subtract from the selection is to simply press and hold the Option (Alt) key, which temporarily switched the tool to the subtracting version (you can see the tool switch modifiers at the top of the screen as you do this.) Either way, click and drag slightly on the offending shrubbery, and it will be deselected:      You can adjust the sensitivity of the selection by adjusting the size. The larger the size, the more will be selected. Try it out: click the standard Quick Selection tool, set the size to 100, then try selecting the house again.       , According to Adobe, this is the most used tool in Photoshop. It's one of the tools that absent anything else, can dramatically improve the composition of your photographs. When you select the Crop tool, you will notice small handles on the corners, and on the edges in the center of the image:   To crop an image, either drag the handles to surround the part of the image you wish to keep, or click and drag inside the image to draw the area to crop.However you do it, the result will be the area you're keeping will be normal, and the area to be cut will be dimmed. Make a selection similar to this, then press Enter:      Notice how that's changed the entire focus of the picture. Before you do anything else, click Undo (Command-Z, Mac, or Control-Z, PC) to restore the image to its original dimensions. If did make further changes, you can step back through your editing history using Command-Option-Z (Control-Alt-Z). Perspective crop. Rather than just a plain rectangle crop, Perspective Crop lets you adjust the relative perspective of the image as you crop. While an interesting and powerful tool, well worth experimenting with, it's a more advanced feature that will be covered in more advanced tutorials. The Slice tools, also part of the Crop menu, are designed to carve up an image for placement into web pages. Like the Perspective crop, this is an advanced feature to be addressed in more suitable tutorials.  , They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes a picture is not enough: you want words, too! Photoshop's text tool gives you a few options.   With the Text tool selected, click near the bottom left of the picture. You'll see a blinking text insertion cursor. Type ""Boats in the Bay."" Depending on your settings, it might be too large, or too small, or a hard to read color. The editor for the text attributes is at the top of the Photoshop window:       Font family. This menu, like all font menus, lets you select the desired font. You can select from the list, or type in the font name. It will autofill as you type. For the purposes of this tutorial, select Helvetica.  Font style. If there are related font styles for the font family (e.g., Bold, Italic, Light, Medium, etc.), they will be available in this popup menu. If the menu is grayed, that means there are no variations on the current font family. For our purposes, select ""Regular.""  Font size. This adjusts the size of the font. You have the option of entering in a specific font size, or choosing a size from a small list. For fast, flexible, and easy font size changes, click and hold on the T icon to the left of the field, and drag to the left or right: the size should change dramatically.  Antialiasing. This will determine the strength of the edge blending. ""None"" turns off antialiasing, and text is rendered like it was rendered in 1984: like blocky stair steps. Here's a comparison of the different antialiasing settings:       Justification. The icons say it all: this justifies all text in the selected layer to the left, center, or right.  Color. This color chip defaults to the foreground color when you first choose the Text tool. To change the color, select the text layer itself, or with the Text cursor, any part of the text in a field. Click on the chip, select a color, and any selected text, plus all future text will be that new color. Note: If you select a text field with multiple colors, the color chip will display a question mark (?). All other text attributes will show as blanks.  Warp. This bends, or ""warps"" the text on the horizontal or vertical axis. To use it, simply select the text layer, click on the Warp button, and work the Style and sliders to find the right look . For this, we'll use the Flag style, and set the bend to 100%.       Panels. The Panels button opens up two more palettes: Character and Paragraph. Use these to fine-tune the look of your text.  , To do this, click and drag from the top left corner of where you want your text box to appear, to the bottom right corner of the box. You'll see a rectangle on the screen, with handles on the corners and sides.   Type some a couple sentences into the box. Don't worry if the text is too big or too small. When you're done entering text, press the Enter key. If your text is too small, use the Font Size control (at the top) to make it larger. Conversely, if your text is too large, use the Font Size control to make the text smaller. You can also adjust the size of the text field: hover over one of the handles for a couple seconds, and your cursor will change to a double arrow. Click and drag to resize the text box: the text will flow within the boundaries of the box.       , Save the file if you like, or discard changes. Either way, you can always get an untouched version here.

You can discuss drug interactions, side-effects, and dosage with a psychiatrist.   A mental health professional will guide you in considering your options and making an informed decision regarding medication.; , Discuss all medications you are currently taking with your prescriber. This also includes any vitamins, herbs, and supplements. Communicate any allergies or adverse effects you’ve encountered with other medications.You may also include a family history of medication use if known.   Prepare your medication history before your appointment. Write down what medications you take and any interactions you’ve had with medications.  , For many, therapy and medication together is effective at treating severe depression. While medication can help manage symptoms of depression, therapy can help you approach life more productively. Therapy can help bring awareness to thoughts and behaviors and change them to be more adaptive.   For many individuals, therapy alone is the best course of treatment.Some studies have shown that cognitive therapy is as effective as medication., Follow your prescriber’s directions when taking medication. Your prescriber may indicate when to take medication (morning, afternoon or night), whether to include food, and how often to take your dose.   Some studies show that using a low dose of TCAs is beneficial in reducing symptoms and decreasing the risk of side-effects.Do not “double dose” or skip doses. Stick to a regular schedule of taking medication.  , Some people may notice effects within a few days. With TCAs, it’s common for people to experience effects after 2-4 weeks after the medication has had time to build up in the body. Even if the medication feels ineffective, it’s recommended to wait 3-4 weeks before switching to another medication or stopping completely.Do not increase your dose if you feel like the medication is not working. Stick with it, and if you are concerned, contact your provider.  , Higher doses of TCAs can cause serious health problems. Some medical doctors may periodically take blood tests to ensure the medications are not adversely affecting health.These tests measure the levels of TCAs in the bloodstream.  , Do not share medication with friends or family members, and do not sell medication. If you think someone you know may benefit from TCAs, refer them to a prescriber. Do not share your dose. Under no circumstances is it advised to share medications.Recognize the risks of sharing medication. For instance, the individual may have a drug allergy or experience very negative side-effects.  , If you are already on TCAs, let your doctor know about your plans around pregnancy. You may need to adjust your dose or stop taking medication altogether. Discuss your concerns with your doctor.  , Stopping medication abruptly or skipping doses can create withdrawal symptoms in the body. Symptoms may include nausea, sweating, flu-like symptoms, headache, dizziness, and muscle cramping. Before stopping, talk about ending your course of medication with your prescriber. He or she will help you taper your doses gradually to minimize withdrawal symptoms., TCAs can cause unpleasant side-effects. The most common side-effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, drowsiness, increased appetite/weight gain, and sweating. More serious side-effects include disorientation or confusion, tremors, irregular heartbeat, low sex drive or difficulty with orgasm, and more frequent seizures in people who have seizures.Discuss the risks of TCAs carefully with your prescriber prior to beginning medication.  , Each person will respond differently to medication, so it’s important to be aware of any unpleasant side-effects you may encounter. You may try several medications to find one that suits you and is effective.Do not deviate from the prescribed dose, but use as directed.   Keep a journal of any changes you notice in your thoughts and behaviors, both good and bad.  , Monitor any side-effects of the medication, especially within the first few weeks. Notice any changes in thoughts, moods, or behaviors as related to medication use. Keep track of emerging or persistent symptoms and discuss them during regular visits with your prescriber., Let your prescriber know if you experience any negative side-effects. If you feel like the side-effects are not worth the benefits of the medication, communicate this to your prescriber. Your dosage may be adjusted or you may try a different medication.Any major impacts such as hallucinations, confusion, or major health upsets should be reported to your prescriber right away.  , The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States of America requires that all antidepressant medication receive a black box warning, the strictest warning for prescription drugs. Children, teenagers, and young adults can be at increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors while taking TCAs. Risk is highest in the first months of taking medications as well as around any changes in dosage.If you experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors seek help immediately. Go to the Emergency Department, call a hotline, or contact a friend to help you. Contact your therapist and psychiatrist immediately.  , While taking TCAs, you can run the risk of getting Serotonin Syndrome, which means the body is flooded with too much serotonin. Dangerously high serotonin levels lead to anxiety, agitation, confusion, tremors, restlessness, lack of coordination, and rapid heart rate. If you experience these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.The most common reason for serotonin syndrome occurs when individuals mix TCAs with St. John’s Wort. If you take St. John’s Wort, talk to your prescriber about it during your appointment. Take extra precaution if you have one of the following diagnoses: a heart condition, prostate enlargement, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, epilepsy, liver problems, or bipolar disorder., TCAs can make the effects of alcohol stronger. It’s important to set limits while taking TCAs. Talk to your prescriber about healthy limits for alcohol consumption while taking TCAs., TCAs have the potential to be abused and misused.Use TCAs only as directed by your prescriber.   When taking TCAs, take only the prescribed dose.

"['make a seaweed salad', 'make sunomono', 'make a seaweed dressing', 'try a seaweed soup']",How to Add Seaweed to Your Diet1," Seaweed salad is popular in Japan, and it’s a cinch to make. Just put 30 grams (one ounce) of dry mixed seaweed in a bowl. Fill the bowl with cold water. Let the seaweed rehydrate for five minutes if you like crunchy seaweed. If you like softer seaweed, allow it to rehydrate for 10 minutes.In a small mixing bowl, combine one tablespoon of rice vinegar, one tablespoon toasted sesame oil, one tablespoon soy sauce, one tablespoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon ginger juice. Add an additional teaspoon of rice vinegar for good measure. Drain the seaweed. Wring out any excess water by squeezing it gently by hand. Wipe the bowl down and put the seaweed back in the bowl. Pour the ginger/soy sauce dressing over it. Mix the dressing and seaweed so that the seaweed is thoroughly coated. Top with one tablespoon toasted sesame seeds and one diced scallion. Seaweed salad is great on its own or as a topping for burgers.; , Sunomono is a twist on the regular seaweed salad. To get started, combine 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) rice vinegar, 1/8 teaspoon soy sauce, two tablespoons soy sauce, and 1.5 teaspoons lemon juice in a small bowl. Set aside.Put 2.5 tablespoons dried wakame seaweed in a bowl with 1.5 cups (360 milliliters) of water. Set aside for about 10 minutes and allow the seaweed to rehydrate. Slice two or three Japanese or Persian cucumbers into thin slices. In a third bowl, mix the cucumber slices with a generous amount of salt. Allow the salt to remove moisture from the cucumber for about 10 minutes. Rinse the cucumber slices off in a colander. Gently squeeze any water that may have been reabsorbed by placing the slices between a few sheets of paper towel and pressing the water out. Mix the cucumber and wakame, then pour a tablespoon or two of the dressing over each serving.  , Instead of making seaweed the star of your salad, give it a supporting role. Heat two toasted nori sheets up in the oven on your oven’s lowest setting. Check the sheets frequently. When they turn slightly brown and crispy, remove them. Break them into smaller pieces and grind them with a mortar and pestle.Pour the nori dust in a blender and combine with one tablespoon orange zest, ½ tablespoon salt, two tablespoons sesame oil, and ¾ cup (180 milliliters) of rice wine vinegar. Pour it in an empty dressing bottle or squirt bottle. Refrigerate and shake well before use. Seaweed dressing is great over roasted veggies or salads, and also works well as a marinade for fish.  , Seaweed soup is a popular dish in Korea, where it is known as miyeokguk. To make some tasty seaweed soup for yourself, soak one ounce of dried brown seaweed in warm water for about 10 minutes.Drain the water and gently squeeze out excess water by hand. Cut the seaweed into two-inch (five-centimeter) strips. Coat a saucepan with two teaspoons of sesame oil, then add 1/4 pound (113 grams) minced beef top sirloin, ½ tablespoon soy sauce, a pinch of salt. Cook over medium heat for one minute. Stir in the rehydrated seaweed and one tablespoon soy sauce. Cook for one minute. Stir frequently. Pour two cups (475 milliliters) of water into the saucepan. Bring the pan to a boil. Add one teaspoon minced garlic and four cups water. Return the pan to a boil, then cover. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly before eating. Add salt to taste.  ","['seaweed salad', 'seaweed soup', 'sunomono', 'seaweed']"
"['consider the brat method', 'eat bananas', 'cook white rice', 'consume more applesauce', 'make toast', 'try variations in the method', 'shift your approach with children', 'get potassium elsewhere']",How to Treat Diarrhea (BRAT Diet Method)1," Physicians often recommend the BRAT method when someone is suffering from acute diarrhea, which is diarrhea that last for less than 14 days. This method, which is a diet of bland foods incorporated into your diet, helps settle your stomach and helps you recover from a gastrointestinal infection that causes diarrhea. BRAT stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods are typically recommended because they are easy to digest, are well tolerated by most people, and low in fiber to help firm up stool.   This is not a weight loss method and it not recommended for the long term. This diet is low in protein, fat, and fiber and lacks key nutrients needed to live over time. Only use this method for the few days it takes to be able to stomach normal food when you have diarrhea. Make sure you stick to it for at least 24 hours to help with your symptoms.Indeed, the major concern that doctors have about the BRAT diet is that it is unnecessarily restrictive and provides suboptimal nutrition. You should not stay on it for more than a few days until your diarrhea subsides.; , The first step in the BRAT method is to eat bananas. Bananas are great when you are suffering from diarrhea because they are bland and easy on the stomach. They are also helpful because they are rich in potassium, which will help counter the loss of nutrients from diarrhea. Eat plenty of bananas while you are suffering from diarrhea. Do not over stuff yourself and cause more stomach issues. Only eat what you can without making yourself sick. Bananas contain about 422 mg of potassium making bananas a potassium rich superfood with 13% of the RDA of potassium in one banana. Potassium in an important electrolyte responsible for providing energy for the cells, tissues, and organs of the body.Green bananas are preferable due to the increased mounts of pectin.  , While rice is a great, bland starch that can easily be tolerated when your stomach is upset. Eat it by itself without added butter or salt. The extra ingredients may upset your stomach even more, especially in the first few days of the diarrhea.Don't eat brown rice. Brown rice has increased fiber, which can make your stools loose and may make your diarrhea worse., Applesauce is also bland but also has added sweetness and natural sugars. This is easily digested and easy to tolerate, even if your stomach is upset. You can buy individual applesauce cups for ease or large jars of applesauce to serve in bowls. Eat multiple servings of applesauce a day to help your calorie intake and keep your stomach settled.Avoid buying the flavored types of applesauce because they have increased sugar content and may upset your stomach more. One concern is that doctors have is the consumption of simple sugars. Simple sugars, like the sugars contained in applesauce, increase stool output and are low in sodium and potassium, which are key electrolytes of the body., One of the blandest foods you can eat is plain bread. It is a good source of bland carbohydrates that are easy to digest when your stomach is upset. White bread is better because the flavor is milder and there is less fiber and will help firm up your stools.Avoid putting butter and sugary jams on your toast. Butter is high in fat and sugary jams can make your stomach worse., There are two common variations in the BRAT method. There is the BRATY method, which adds yogurt to the method. Plain yogurt has increased potassium and good bacteria for your system. You can also try the BRATT method, which adds tea to the routine. Gentle herbal teas can help keep you hydrated and settle your stomach.   You can combine them all to make the BRATTY method if you think all the different components work for you., In recent years, there are some doctors that believe the BRAT diet may be too restrictive for children with acute diarrhea because it lacks the nutrients their bodies need to get better. These doctors suggest this diet in the first 24 hours of the condition. After this period, they recommend adding in more nutrient rich foods from the children's normal diet while avoiding foods with simple sugars. These include soda, juice, gelatin desserts, or other highly sugared foods, which may worsen the diarrhea. Once the illness is over, children should receive additional nutrition to compensate for any nutritional deficiency that arose during the illness.   Certain guidelines have recommended avoiding fatty foods, but maintaining adequate calories without fat is difficult, and fat might have a beneficial effect of reducing intestinal motility. Instead, don't give your child overly greasy foods with little amount of nutrients in them. Try to make them eat the foods of the BRAT method in the first 24 hours, even if it is in small doses to avoid them getting sick. The somewhat common practice of withholding food when diarrhea is first developed is inappropriate. Early feeding decreases changes in intestinal permeability caused by infection, which can reduce the duration of the illness duration and improves the outcome. Doctors recommend an age appropriate diet with complex carbohydrate, lean meats, yogurt, fruit, and vegetables. These are better tolerated than fats and simple sugars., If you do not like bananas or want to get your potassium from other sources while you are sick, there are many additional bland foods that can provide potassium for you. White beans, baked potato with skin, dried apricots, and avocados are great sources of potassium and can help you recuperate during bouts of diarrhea.Only eat these foods if you think your stomach is ready for them. You don't want to upset your system even more than it already is.

"['seek referrals for residential contractors', 'verify if the residential contractor has a license as required by law', 'verify that the residential contractor has insurance', 'speak with references or past clients of the residential contractor', 'compare the fees and services of multiple contractors', 'review the contract provided to you by the residential contractor']",How to Choose a Residential Contractor," You can seek referrals from friends and family members, consumer protection agencies, or organizations that train or regulate contractors.   Visit the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website featured in the Sources section of this article, or call the BBB for feedback on a particular contractor at 1-703-276-0100 in the United States or at 514-905-3893 in Canada. (Though this point in case of USA Builders only) Consult with an organization that focuses on improving or that regulates the business of contracting, such as the National Association of Home Builders. Organizations such as these may provide you with the contact information for reputable contractors who belong to the organization. Verify that the residential contractor who was referred to you worked on a task similar to the task you are hiring them for. For example, if you need to choose a residential contractor to work on your roof, you may not want to hire a residential contractor who specializes in installing air conditioning systems.; , Some states or regions may require residential contractors to obtain a license prior to practicing contracting business.   Consult with your state or region's licensing regulator to determine if a contracting license is required by law to practice business. Visit the ""Contractor's License"" website provided to you in the Sources section of this article, then click directly on your state. You will then be taken to a webpage that indicates if a license is required by the state, as well as contact information for the contracting regulator. Ask the residential contractor to show you their license or certification prior to hiring them.  , Hiring a residential contractor with insurance or worker's compensation may protect you from lawsuits or from paying expenses in the event the contractor is injured while working on your property.   Ask the contractor to provide you with proof of insurance. In most cases, residential contractors are required to have an insurance policy before they can legally perform contracting work.  , This will allow you to determine if other consumers have had positive experiences with the contractor.   Obtain a list of references or past clients from the residential contractor. The references can be clients with either positive, or negative experiences. Contact each reference and ask them for details about their experience with the contractor. If any references had issues with the contractor, obtain details about the problems and their outcomes. This will allow you to determine if the contractor is experienced with handling and resolving problems that may arise while on the job.  , These factors may allow you to determine the value offered by each residential contractor.   Ask each residential contractor about the types of materials they will use, the amount of time it will take them to complete the project, and a complete list and description of each fee. Some contractors may charge you lower prices if they are using materials that are lower in quality.  , A reputable contractor will provide you with a detailed contract that outlines the terms, policies, guidelines, and timeline of the project.   Ask a friend, family member, or acquaintance familiar with contracts for help with understanding and reviewing the contract terms. This may prevent you from signing a contract with terms that are unethical, unprofessional, or less than favorable.

"['stop unkind conversations', 'be an anti-bullying advocate', 'take action against cyberbullying', 'talk to people who are different from you']",How to Stand Up for Others3," Put an end to all conversations that put down or gossip about someone else. You don't have to be friends with the person being trash-talked, but it's important to tell the trash-talker not to speak badly of other people, even if you don’t particularly like the talked-about person either.   You can defend the person being trash-talked. For example, if someone says, ""I hate Maddie! She's so ugly,” your response can be, ""That's mean. Don't talk about people like that. I think Maddie is pretty."" Tell the speaker to stop talking about other people this way. You could say, “I don’t think it’s right to be making fun of him like this. Please stop.” If they continue, walk away from the conversation. Something else may be happening in the bully's life that is causing them to bully others. Sometimes people may act out because they are suffering stress or experiencing other issues at home. They may also have been bullied themselves, or they may have been a victim of abuse. These people may be in need of additional support, such as mental health counseling, to address these issues. Try your best to gently inquire about these possibilities. Offer supportive guidance to encourage them to seek help from a qualified professional.  , Teach others how to stand up to bullies and to stand up for what’s right. Find anti-bullying or anti-discrimination resources appropriate for your audience, educate yourself, and share what you’ve learned.   Find resources that support a cause you believe in and is valuable to your audience. For example, you may wish to learn about bullying to raise awareness to your high school, or you may wish to learn about hate crimes against a minority population to help raise awareness in your community. People will be more receptive to your campaign if it is something they can connect with. Assist your local community, workplace, or schools with establishing a reporting system to make it easier for victims to seek help. Communities, workplaces, and schools can use these procedures to help identify easy and practical ways for victims to report bullying or harassment. They are also able to use these reports to track bullying and harassment trends over time so that they can develop better prevention procedures. If you are in school, you could start an anti-bullying group, or talk to your school’s leadership about things that could be done to help prevent bullying at your school., If you're online and see other people talking badly about someone or sending harassing messages to them, report their account. Most social media websites have an option to report people for abusive behavior, and cyberbullying is considered abusive behavior by almost every website's Terms of Service.   Remind people to think before they post. Once you post something, it is out of your hands and on the internet forever. If your friend wants to post something mean about a classmate, you could say, “Do you really want to post that? It could get back to him really easily, and it will make you look bad.”Treat other people on the internet the same exact way you would treat them in real life. If you don’t have something nice to say, don’t say it at all, or share your differing opinion respectfully. Avoid using websites that allow you to be anonymous. People sometimes take advantage of anonymity features on a website to harass people. If you’re a kid or teenager, allow your parents access to your passwords and social media accounts. They can help you if you encounter any problems online., Make an effort to learn more about people of different races, cultures, religions, or sexual orientations than yours. The more you learn about someone’s life, the more likely you are to have empathy toward them and their situation. Promote a culture of empathy among people in your life. Knowing more about another person’s story can help prevent bullying and help others speak out against it.You could make friends with classmates or coworkers who have different backgrounds. Once you get to know them better, you may find that you share a lot of the same things in common.  Volunteer for a cause that supports people who have different circumstances than you do. You could volunteer at a homeless shelter, set up an apartment for a refugee family, or work with your faith community to set up a fellowship with a different faith group. Read books about people or written by people who are of a different background than yours.  ","['anti-bullying advocate', 'unkind conversations', 'action', 'people']"
"['write down everything you think and want to do freely', 'take a look at your aims', ""continue writing until you feel that you've adequately addressed the feelings that truly represent you"", 'begin to put your list of feelings as actions into action', 'express yourself through talking', 'shouting', 'explaining yourself', 'wear the clothes that you like and care about', 'devote as much or as little time to your appearance as you see fit', 'let your emotions', 'feelings and opinions have self-determined outlets', 'come up with more of your own actions']",How to Act Like How You Feel," Write it down in a list. This is the calm approach to take, instead of just blowing up like TNT in the middle of normal life and letting loose whenever the urge bubbles up.   Consider getting a diary or a locked notebook, or whatever works for you––from an A4 paper to the corner of a wall, writing will help you to work out just what things you really feel like doing to let your feelings out.; , Remove ideas that are harmful, stupid, thoughtless or plain dangerous. These are your dark thoughts and they're okay, everyone has them but let them stay on paper alone. Don't feed them. For all the positive, nurturing, flourishing, dramatic, wonderful, growing, inspiring and creative things, leave them on the list. They are the direction in which you wish to head, to express your true self. This doesn't mean letting go of the daring, the wild and the vibrant––it just means being realistic and sensible about what is doable, what is safe enough for you and what won't bring harm to others.   If you discover that your aims keep erring toward hurting yourself or others, seek help with a parent, spouse, counselor, therapist or psychiatrist. You cannot remain in this dark place––allowing it to define you can foster pain and hardship; given there are some good ways to handle your darker creative self without giving in to the demons, take the opportunities to do so by letting others help you.  , Then think about how to express those feelings through actions. The actions may be in private, in public; they may be via video or audio, via real life or via art and craft; they might be expressed through sports, a hobby, a shouting festival or eclectic clothing and hair. It's totally up to you how to begin expressing these feelings through actions.  , Once you're happy that you've defined the actions that will give life to your feelings, find the outlets for these feelings. There are many possibilities, and it'll be up to your creative muse to define, refine and act upon them as wished. The following steps provide a few suggestions for ways to act as you feel.  , You might want to shout out who you actually are in a public area, or calmly explain that you are not that type of girl who likes pinky cute dresses to your mom. Punching pillows and not taking no as an answer is also good. In this case. Not in all cases! If you smile and add a That's me after each outstanding action you do might make you seem and be confident.  , Don't wear things because they're fashionable, your friends like them or they're all the rage on Instagram. Wear them because you like the statement that they make for you.   If you must, find a friend who will wear the same clothes and support you until you feel confident enough to do it alone.  , Braid your leg hairs if you wish; who says being hairless is the ultimate form of happiness anyway? Shave them off in strange designs if you'd rather. Just don't change your appearance because you feel the need to conform––treat your appearance as an extension of expressing how you feel and be proud of it.   Makeup is completely individual to you. If you love it, wear it. If you hate it, don't wear it. If you want it on some days and not other days, that's just fine. If you want long hair, short hair, curly hair, dyed hair, no hair, frizzy hair, gray hair, it's your choice. Just don't cook at the local fast food take-out without a hair net; in other words, be sensible about where and in what form you express yourself.  , There are rules about everything in social life, you don't have to look far to find them and even less further to find those who love to remind you of them. However, a lot of these rules are for the lost, not for utility for one's self-expression. If you want to act as you feel, here are some of the common areas where the rules police can hamper your freedom in ways that aren't very helpful, and you're free to express yourself as you need to:   Grieving: If you wish to grieve over the loss of a loved one for five minutes or five years, that's personal to you; it's how you feel and any arbitrary time limit on how long is long enough or too long is an imposition of someone else's idea of what's right. Success: Different meanings of success can be found everywhere across countries, across the regions, across the world. While some people may lay claim to a perfect formula of what looks like success, only you can decide that for yourself. If where you are in life right now works for you, that's great––it's okay to be satisfied with the choices you've made at various points in your life. Parenting: Everyone knows how to be a great parent until they become one. After the children leave home, suddenly they're great parents again. It is telling that those in the middle of the doing the actual parenting get so much advice from people younger and older than them on getting it right, from those yet to know and those who have forgotten just how hard it is. Remember, their rules may have worked for them (or seem good to them) but yours are just as good. Education: Make up your own mind by using critical thinking and being a good philosopher. Don't abdicate the ability to think for yourself. Reflect on deeper issues often and come up with what you believe, think and value. Listen to others but remember that their rules work for them; let yours, not theirs, define who you are.  , Make this a lifelong process, to express yourself as you feel, in ways that help others to do the same and that are inclusive of others, respectful of yourself and others and that let people see the real you when the moment is right.","['feelings', 'action', 'look', 'self-determined outlets', 'everything', 'little time', 'clothes', 'emotions', 'fit', 'appearance', 'opinions', 'aims', 'list', 'actions']"
"['collect frogspawn', 'watch for frogspawn to hatch', 'feed your tadpoles', 'ensure that your tadpoles get sufficient calcium', 'clean your tank frequently', 'look for signs of infection']",How to Care for Common Frog Tadpoles2," You can easily capture all the frogspawn (frog eggs) you want to raise from a local pond, lake or stream. Bring a net or a bucket to this water source. When you arrive at the prepared habitat, use a small mesh net to collect and transfer the frogspawn.Make sure you can put the frogspawn directly into their new habitat. Raise the tadpoles separately from other aquatic animals. They should get their own habitat.  , When tadpoles are first hatched, you should have a quantity of fresh pond weed, partly as food and partly as support for young tadpoles. Dried stinging nettle leaves crushed into a fine powder can also be fed to the young tadpoles.Scatter the pond weed and nettle leaves across the surface of the water. Tadpoles eat only vegetarian fare until their legs start to grow.  , Tadpoles in the wild normally feed on algae, but this may be difficult to find where you life. Feeding each tadpole two tablespoons of boiled lettuce or spinach is a good substitute for algae. Vegetarian fish flakes are another option, but avoid any fish flakes that incorporate animal byproducts. You should feed your tadpoles twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.Add two crushed rabbit food pellets to supplement the diet of each tadpole. You don't need to feed them this more than once a day. Twice a week, you can add some hardboiled egg yolk to their diet to provide protein.  , Calcium is necessary to build the young bones of your tadpoles. The easiest way to do this is to add 2 drops of liquid calcium per liter of water, or 4 drops per gallon.Read the label carefully to make sure it doesn't contain additives that may be harmful to your tadpoles. Adding a piece of cuttlebone (a sea shell) to the tank will also provide a nice, natural source of calcium.  , You'll know that the water needs changing if you notice a cloudy appearance or unpleasant odor to the water. Watch for tadpoles lingering near the surface or waste settling at the bottom of the tank. Make sure that any new water is the same temperature as the water already in the tank– drastic changes in water temperature can kill your tadpoles.To clean your tank, you will need to have a second location where you can keep the tadpoles while you clean the inside of their tank. If your water isn't very dirty, you can leave the tadpoles in their habitat, while removing about a third of the water. Never use commercial cleaning products, which may contain harmful chemicals A clean tank will help prevent your tadpoles from getting infected or diseased.  , Ranavirus is the most common virus to affect cold-blooded amphibians like tadpoles. Tadpoles affected by ranavirus may appear lethargic, or you might notice them swimming erratically, weakly, or on their sides.Bacterial infections are the main cause of death among frogs and tadpoles. The best way to prevent infection is to improve your tadpoles' immune system through proper maintenance of their habitat, nutritious food, and adequate oxygen. Signs of infection might be easiest to see by looking at the water. If you notice your water appearing cloudy yellowish-white, or a slimy series of bubbles all along the top of the water's edge, there's likely to be a higher chance of infection developing.

"['have a space prepared', 'purchase the equipment', 'stand back and watch the magic.']",How to Plan a Playground," You need at least a 20' x 20' space. This is to support the normal swingset/monkey bar combo with a slide. To add more equipment means you will need more space. To make your ground surface accessible by all children, plan to utilize a re-purposed rubber surface. If you wish to go more traditional, use either wood chips, sand or pea gravel.; , The type of equipment you wish to have on site will be entirely up to you. Some of the more modern offerings and entirely traditional offerings are:   A shade. Now, more than ever, industrial playground builders are becoming creative in the wake of more exposure to the sun. A large shade can be used in place of mature trees, if no trees can be found. A set of swings. A typical swingset will include at least 1 traditional swing and perhaps an identical one next to it or a modified horse swing where potentially 2 people can sit and push while pulling and make the swing 'go.' Alternatively, a baby swing can be placed next to the traditional swing or, more recently, a handicapped swing, with full-buckling ability can be used. An industrial set can include up to four or five swings. You can alter their heights to allow for shorter legs vs. longer legged pre-teens. Climbing things. Rock walls have become welcome additions to swingsets, allowing children more options. A rock-wall pattern can even be used in a more personal swing set, to allow for children's climbing up to a slide area. Towers. A tower area gives rise to the imagination, as well as an appropriate height for both slides and zip lines and dual towers allows for the plank walkways that make those satisfying rumbles as well as a little bounce in your step. Children delight in taking turns jumping and forcing a jounce in the other child's step. Tire swings. A tire swing is an alternative style swing that allows children to tackle the swinging thing up to three at a time. Spin or sway, its up to the children. Slides. Slides can be short or long and they can spiral or go straight or go bump, bump, bump. Slides have come a long way since the 50s and 60s when they were all made out of metal. Now slides can be made out of plastics, just beware of the static electricity build up. Tunnels. Tunnels are great ways to get a child's inner energy out and the best thing is, it can go under the swingset or next to it or be used for an obstacle course. Made out of plastic, make sure its covered by shade as these can get really hot in the sun. Telephone cans. Modern telephone cans are funnels which have sprinkler-type heads. The connecting tubing can be buried below the play set so that two kids can go on opposite sides and whisper secret messages to one another or plan a secret rendezvous. Ball pits. Each of the next following items can be really fun, but they also come with their own warnings. Ball pits are great fun and the pleasure of sinking into a pit filled with semi-soft objects that can be thrown at others can be entirely enjoyable. However, a warning would be that for younger kids the temptation to go wee-wee while not being seen is a little tempting and spiders enjoy the shaded areas that the balls en-masse present. Sand Pits. The hours that can be spent digging, creating a castle and destroying it afterward can feel rewarding. Watch out for kitties and other critters of the night which can perceive this as a litterbox. Also, some spiders actually enjoy burrowing in the sand as a good cool place to be. Water Play. A water fountain or a shooting spout can be the best of summertime enjoyment. Be sure to have a way to turn it off for winter and non-use times. If it is to be for public use, post the times the play park will be active and stick to that schedule. Try to have anti-microbial rubber matting or cement with more texture to allow for children running and playing in the water. If you choose to have it move, to prevent standing water where insects can breed, then have jets at appropriate intervals to 'move the water.'  ,","['equipment', 'magic', 'space']"

They may try to make fun of you. If this happens, just stand your ground and tell them firmly but politely that you care about the planet and that you want to make sure that we have a safe and healthy environment to live in. Also remember that some people will never be convinced, so just smile and accept that they cannot move from their notions but this does not mean that you have to give up. Set examples through doing and you may just convince them another way.; , Junk mail causes extra trash to be produced and you can reduce this. Each day, ask them for one piece of junk mail from the daily mail. Call or email the company which sent the mail, and ask them to remove your house from their mailing list. Explain to your parents that they can use online catalogs or perhaps even consider buying less stuff.  , The easiest way to do this is to create a signature for your emails which reads:   Save the Earth through Junk Mail Reduction. Each day, when you collect your mail, call or email one junk mailer and ask to be deleted from their mailing list. Affix this note to the bottom of each email you send and become a part of the movement!  , Donate some money to environmental causes and to charities that help poverty. Poverty is a major cause of environmental problems also and if you help to stop people living in poverty, you will also be helping to protect the environment. Consider helping a charity that encourages those in poverty to grow their own organic garden. This provides food that is nutritious, budget-wise and also is an enjoyable activity.  , When not in use, turn off or unplug electrical appliances.  , Make sure to recycle things that can be recycled. Learn the recycling numbers on the base of many things such as bottles, boxes, and cans. This will help you to know if your item can be recycled or not. If it cannot be, contact your municipality and ask why they are not recycling some items. Set up a neighborhood petition to get the municipality to change its mind if it will not recycle some things.  , Water can be saved by using water efficient shower heads and sink heads. Ask your parents to replace old faucets, shower heads and sink heads. Again, you can help by doing the research online for them.  , Pick up litter and trash on the ground and recycle what can be recycled. Always wear gloves and use a stick to pick up items rather than putting your hands into holes etc.  , Instead of littering, it is important to recycle items that are recyclable and to properly dispose of other items. Littering is not only unpleasant to look at but it attracts vermin, it makes a mess of animal homes and it is a waste of products that can be reused.  , Plant some native species trees, bushes, and other plants which will provide food and cover for the animals living in your area. Ask your parents to reconsider their lawn and to have native grasses or some other decorative feature that doesn't need a lot of watering or mowing.  , Ask your school to have either a water wise, living wise, or Energy Wise presentation. In the USA, these presentations come with a kit which supplies free items, the water wise kit comes with a water efficient shower head, sink and kitchen aerators, and other items. Ask your school about buying a road. If they do this they have to clean up all the litter.  , You may think that no one cares about the planet but a small group of people, but you are wrong!!

"['find your deadline', 'try to negotiate', 'ask friends or family for a loan', 'search for other low-interest loans', 'notify the lender of your intent to redeem', 'get a certified or cashier’s check', 'take the check to the lender', 'fill out paper work', 'get the keys', 'find out how delinquent you are', 'come up with the money', 'call the lender', 'pay off your overdue car payments']",How to Redeem Your Repossessed Car," After the lender repossesses the car, it should send you some notices in the mail. One notice should inform you of how you can redeem your car. The notice should also tell you the deadline for redeeming the car and the redemption amount. If you don’t receive this notice within five days of repossession, then contact the lender.You must get the full amount in order to redeem the car. Redemption is not “reinstatement.” When you reinstate a loan, you pay any missed monthly payments. The loan then continues on as usual. With redemption, you must pay the entire balance of the loan. Note the deadline and commit to getting the full amount before then. You have no right to reinstatement, so redemption might be your only way of getting the car back.; , It can’t hurt to call up the lender and ask if you could redeem the car for less than the price the lender is asking.The lender will have to sell your car at auction, and there is always a chance that the only buyer will make a low offer. The lender could lose money on the sale.   The lender might be asking for $7,500, but you might only be able to gather together $6,000. If so, you should call and explain your situation.  , You probably don’t have the money to redeem your vehicle. If you did, you wouldn’t have missed your monthly payments in the first place.Accordingly, you need to try and get a loan for the full redemption amount. Your friends and family might be able to forward you some money.   Try to get a loan interest-free or low interest. For example, if the redemption price is $10,000, then your monthly payments on a five-year loan will be about $175 a month with a two percent interest rate. However, if your interest rate is eight percent, then you would end up paying almost $200 a month. Talk to your family and friends. They might be willing to loan you the money for a low interest rate (or without charging interest at all). If they agree to loan you money, then you should draft a loan document.  , If your friends or family won’t loan to you, then you should seek a low-interest loan from other sources. Look into loans from local credit unions.   Before taking out any loan, make sure that you can make the monthly payments. There is no reason to take out another loan if you will only default on repayments in the future. To calculate your monthly car payment, you can use one of the many calculators on the Internet. Plug in the amount of the loan, the length of the loan, and the interest rate. You will then get a monthly payment amount., You should promptly notify the lender of your intent to redeem the car. Your right to redeem will end once the car is sold, so you need to reach out to the lender quickly.Typically, lenders hold onto cars for only 10-15 days before selling them at auction.You shouldn’t take too much time. The notice you receive might tell you how to notify the creditor. For example, you might need to send a letter certified mail. Always follow the method stated in the notice.  , You might need to pay the lender using a certified check or a cashier’s check. These are more secure forms of payment than a personal check. You can get them at a bank.   With a certified check, a bank officer certifies that you had enough money in your account to cover the check on the date the officer certified it.With a cashier’s check, the funds are moved from your account to the bank’s own escrow account. The check is then drawn on the bank’s account.  , You should contact the lender and find out where to take your check. Also ask who you should meet with and the specific process for redeeming the vehicle.   Try to redeem the car a few days before the auction date. Once the car is sold, it’s gone. You don’t want to wait until the morning of the auction only to miss a bus, have your car break down, or get sick.  , You may need to complete some paperwork in order to redeem the car. The lender should let you know. Try to get a copy of any form you fill out.   Also get a receipt for the money you are handing over. This receipt will serve as proof that you have legally redeemed the car. You may also have to go to the police department and get a “redemption release,” which costs a small fee. You then must take this lease to the repossession agency., Once you have paid and completed all paperwork, you should be able to go to the agency that repossessed your car and get the car back. Show them the paperwork that you got from the lender and the police.  , Go through your paperwork and check to see how much you owe in unpaid monthly payments. You might be able to get the lender to agree to let you keep the car and reinstate the original loan if you cure any default.   For example, if you missed three rent payments before the lender repossessed your car, and each payment was $300, then you would need to pay $900 to get the original loan reinstated. You might also owe late charges and interest. Once the loan is reinstated, you would then make a monthly rent payment. Reinstatement is usually more feasible than redemption because you can pay the loan off a little at a time each month.  , You will need to pay off all owed car payments. Accordingly, you need to come up with the money—and quickly. Make sure that you have the money in hand before calling the lender to ask for reinstatement.   Pool all available money that you have. Think about selling possessions you need less than the car. For example, you could sell exercise equipment, electronic equipment, or musical instruments. You can take them to a pawn shop or advertise on Craigslist. You also could get an unsecured personal loan from a bank or credit union. You will need to have a good credit score in order to get a personal loan with a low interest rate.This might be difficult if the repossession has already been reported on your credit report. You also might be able to get a short-term loan from family and friends. Although they might not have been willing to loan you a huge amount to redeem the car, they might be more willing to offer a smaller loan to help you get the loan reinstated.  , You should call the phone number on the notice your lender sent. Because time is of the essence, you shouldn’t delay. Instead, call the lender and ask if you can reinstate the loan instead of redeeming the car.   Be honest about your past financial difficulties, but explain why you are in a better position to make payments again. If you can convince the lender that your financial difficulties were temporary, you will be more successful negotiating.Offer to show the lender proof of your improved financial position. For example, you might have recently gotten a job. Offer to show the lender your employment letter.  , If the lender agrees to reinstate the loan, then coordinate how you can pay off your overdue car payments. Also ask how you can pick up your car.

"['do not act overly submissive during disagreements', 'do not accept aggressive behavior', 'create a generally egalitarian relationship', 'find healthy ways to explore dominance and submission', 'especially in the bedroom and in chores', 'be prepared for bluntness', 'communicate clearly', 'have healthy boundaries', 'turn confidence in himself into confidence in the relationship']",How to Date an Alpha Male2," Someone who shares traits with the stereotypical ""alpha male"" might occasionally act stubborn, impatient, and demanding, especially during quarrels.When he slips into these negative patterns, it is important that you do not act overly submissive or apologetic. Instead, remain calm and analytical as you state your case. Walk away from the argument if you need to, but do not flatter, pander, or give in too easily.Some scripts you might use include:   ""I can see that we're not going to reach an agreement tonight. Let's continue talking about this tomorrow."" ""I know that we don't agree on this. But here are the reasons why I think I'm right . . ."" ""I am happy to find middle ground, but I am not willing to let go of my core beliefs. It is important that you are willing to compromise if I am going to compromise too.""  , Be careful if he acts aggressively by breaking things, making threats, or frequently raising his voice to the point that you end up in tears. This is not acceptable behavior, and you deserve better.  Leave the situation immediately if you feel personally threatened. Let him know that his actions are unacceptable, and seek help outside of the relationship from a friend, the authorities, or a domestic abuse hotline.  , In general, people are happy in relationships when there is an egalitarian power structure. In this case, both partners might share chores, have equal say over important decisions, and might both work outside of the home.These relationships are less likely to end in divorce or break-ups.  , While egalitarian relationships are the most successful in the long run, they might also reduce libido and sexual passion.If you are attracted to dominance, consider finding ways for this dominance to be expressed, even if it does not impact your day-to-day decision-making. For example, you might consider:   Introducing a dominant/submissive role-play during sex. Be sure to discuss your preferences and limitations in advance, and make sure that you can stop the role-play at any time by using a ""safe-word."" Finding outlets to perform traditional gender roles. For example, a woman might dress up in traditional feminine outfits; a man might dress up in athletic clothing.Divide chores along gendered lines. If you are a woman in a heterosexual relationship, consider taking on some stereotypically feminine labor, such as cooking or washing dishes. Ask your partner to take on stereotypically masculine labor, such as repairing the car. This might increase sexual attraction., Many people who exhibit typical ""alpha"" traits communicate in a direct manner. They tend not to beat around the bush. Try to keep this in mind so that you are not offended at how direct and straightforward their conversation is. Instead, remember that direct communication can help a relationship avoid patterns of passive-aggression or mutual dissatisfaction:  If your partner's bluntness is insulting or hurtful, however, these are warning signs that your partner is going well beyond ""direct"" communication and is instead hoping to injure your feelings. This is not a sign of confidence but of aggression, and you should consider whether he is worth your time and energy., Tell your partner what you find attractive about him and his confidence. Feel free to be direct about what makes you happy in a relationship.   If you enjoy his athletic ability, for example, tell him that and support his athletic successes. If you are attracted to chivalrous behavior, tell him that you love it when he buys you flowers, jewelry, or surprising you with exotic vacations. Express your delight and pleasure when he engages in these behaviors., If both you and your partner are confident people, you will likely have some independent interests and activities that the other one does not share. Be sure that you both maintain your independence in certain areas, even if you share many other activities. Keep your old friends, keep up with your old hobbies, and spend some time apart every now and again. Healthy boundaries will help the relationship last and will help you both maintain your self-confidence.  , True confidence is not about performing strength but rather about being honest about who you are and what your needs are. People who are confident will not be afraid to build a lasting bond with the right person.If the person you are dating is emotionally honest and is willing to commit, that is a good sign that he is a truly confident person who knows what he wants.

"[""check your current credit card's rewards program"", 'find a credit card with a frequent flyer mile reward program', 'take advantage of any signup bonuses', 'make qualifying purchases', 'build up a sizable points balance', 'locate reward program details', 'call your credit card company and speak to a representative', 'confirm the points to miles conversion rate', 'know if your credit card points or flyer miles have an expiration date', 'check your mile-conversion details', 'create a frequent flyer account online with an airline that is approved by your credit card company', 'plan ahead', 'book your flight with an airline that is approved by your credit card company', 'input your frequent flyer account information when booking a flight online']",How to Convert Credit Card Points to Frequent Flyer Miles," If you already have a credit card, check your card agreement or your issuer's website to see whether you have a points reward program. This program allows you to earn points based on your purchases that can be redeemed for rewards like cash back, gift cards, or frequent flyer miles. Contact your card issuer if you are unsure if your card qualifies for this type of program., If your current card doesn't offer points rewards or the chance to convert points to miles, you'll need to get a card that does. This type of reward is offered from almost all credit cards that offer points, but some options are better than others. Search online to locate cards that allow you to transfer points to miles at a good rate. For example, the following rewards programs allows you to transfer points to miles at a rate of 1 to 1:   American Express Member Rewards. This is available to all American Express cardholders. Citi Thank You. This is available on Citi Thank You cards and others. Chase Ultimate Rewards. Access this program by signing up for a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Ink Plus for Business card.There may be other cards offering a good transfer rate that are a better fit to your spending habits and financial situation. Research terms for several different cards before making a decision.  , Many credit cards offer signup bonuses that immediately credit your rewards account a large number of points if you reach a certain spending milestone within a set time period. In many cases, this can be a significant number of points, perhaps 50,000 or 100,000.   However, you should avoid simply spending to reach this limit, as this might cause you to overspend. Instead, make sure that the spending milestone is in line with your regular spending patterns., Points must be built up by making qualifying purchases on your credit card. The qualifications for a qualified purchase vary between card issuers, so check your card agreement to see what you should use your card for. For example, some point rewards programs offer a flat points rate for all purchases. However, others reward certain purchases, like gas or entertainment, at a higher rate. Others might have a rotating high rewards category each month.   Wherever possible, put qualifying purchases on your credit card. This will help you earn points without changing your spending habits., Even with signup bonuses and frequent credit card purchases, building up a points balance will take time. Many flights you will want to take after converting your points will end up costing upwards of 30,000 miles. For example, a trip to Europe from the US might cost 50,000 to 60,000 points. This means you'll have to take the time to build up a points balance before they will become truly useful., Request a copy of your points program information from your credit card company by calling customer support. This information will also be available online through your card issuer's website. Reward programs typically vary. Different credit cards have different guidelines and restrictions and you should know the specifics of the program to which you belong.   Figure out how, specifically, you can convert your points. You may need to call, but in many cases you can go through the whole process online., Confirm or clarify any details regarding the reward program you don't understand. Make sure that you have all of the information you need to make an informed decision about the best way to use your frequent flyer miles.   Ask about any changes to the rewards program, as these can happen without notice and may affect your miles conversion., This will depend on your card and the chosen frequent flyer miles program. For instance, for some credit cards, 1 point is equivalent to 1 mile. If you have 20,000 points then you will be eligible for 20,000 miles. American Express converts 1,000 rewards points to 750 Delta SkyMiles, while Citi converts 1,000 rewards points to 1,000 Advantage miles.   Transfer your points to the frequent flyer program that offers the best conversion rates., Most points expire within a set timeframe if they go unused. You will want to convert your points to miles and use them before they expire. If your points are expiring and you have no chance to use them, consider giving them to a friend or family member. You can also donate them to charity in most cases., Look out for any regulations or blackout dates that may be imposed upon your miles. Some companies do not allow travel on certain days, times of the year, or to certain destinations. Take notice of restrictions on dates, airlines and destinations.  , Some companies require that you sign up for a frequent flyer account, while others will apply a travel credit directly to your card account. Investigate flight prices in miles as well. Trip prices may vary widely between airlines, so be sure to check several different ones to find the best deal.For example, one airline might offer a specific trip for 70,000 miles, whereas another might have the same trip for 50,000.  , It may take weeks or months to redeem your credit card points for frequent flyer miles that you can use to book a flight. However, some rewards programs allow you to convert points instantly and many of them will make the conversion within a week. Check the terms of your rewards program or call customer service to get an idea of how much time you need to allocate for this process.Try booking in off-times for your destination, as this will make your travel cheaper. For example, don't try to fly to Mexico during the winter holidays, as flights will be more expensive., Not all airlines are valid with frequent flyer rewards. Make sure your points have definitely been converted and you have received a travel credit before booking your flight.   You should also transfer miles to airlines you have transferred miles to or flown with in the past. This will allow you to build up miles with that airline and earn greater rewards. Miles may be used on all airlines within the same alliance (a group of airlines). The main alliances are:  Star Alliance: United, US Airways, Swiss Air, Lufthansa, and others. One World: American Airways, British Airways, Iberia, and others. SkyTeam: Delta, Air France, Korean, and others., There will usually be a field asking for your frequent flyer account number. Have this information on hand. If you run into trouble booking using rewards point, call the airlines to speak to a representative. They will be able to help you complete the transaction.","['purchases', 'credit card', 'signup bonuses', 'frequent flyer account information', 'flight', 'reward program details', 'advantage', 'sizable points balance', 'miles conversion rate', 'airline', 'points', 'mile-conversion details', 'flyer miles', 'representative', 'rewards program', 'flight online', 'credit card points', 'credit card company', 'current credit card', 'expiration date', 'frequent flyer account online']"

For example, if you have a hard time remembering that JFK was the president involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion, just picture the handsome president swimming in an ocean surrounded by happy, oinking pigs. This is absolutely silly, but this concrete image in your mind will forever help you link the president with this event.By creating a visual, your brain can fixate on a single, easy-to-identify piece of information. When you recall that single symbol, you can also recall the larger strand of information you assigned to it. For example, as you place your car keys in your purse, imagine your purse suddenly growing wheels and speeding away. Since the image is such a strange one, you're more likely to remember it later, which will also help you remember that your car keys are inside it. The more unique or unusual the image is, the easier it will be for your brain to remember it., Let's say you keep forgetting your student ID every time you need to use it again. Just break down the number into smaller chunks and create images associated with those chunks. Let's say the number is 12-7575-23. Find a way to make these numbers meaningful. Let's say ""12"" happens to be your house number, ""75"" happens to be your grandmother's age, and the number ""23"" is Michael Jordan's jersey number. Here's what you can visualize to remember the number:   Picture your house with two copies of your grandmother standing to the right, showing that the house comes first. Then imagine Michael Jordan standing to the right of your grandmothers. There you have it -- 12 (your house), 7575 (double-dose of Grandma) and 23, the basketball star.  , Chunking is a way of grouping things together to help you memorize them. Random lists of things (a shopping list, for example) can be especially difficult to remember. To make it easier, try categorizing the individual things from the list. For example, list all of the fruits together, the dairy products together, and the bread products together. Alternatively, you can chunk your list by the starting letter of each item; you need to pick up eggs, bread, bacon, coffee, and cheese from the grocery store, remember one E, two B's, and two C's. As long as you remember the correct numbers, you should be able to recall the items in each letter group. This will not only help you memorize the list, but it'll make your shopping experience much faster.If you can remember that, among other things, you wanted to buy four different kinds of vegetables, you’ll find it easier to remember all four. Chunking is what we do when we list a phone number with dashes. Which looks easier to memorize, 8564359820, or 856-435-9820? You probably won't remember 17761812184818651898, but try putting a space after every fourth number. Now you can see that those numbers are years, and you can pick key events from each year to help you remember the string of numbers (such as the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Mexican-American War, Civil War, and Spanish-American War).  , Using a variety of common and silly rhymes can help you recall basic information. For example, if you're trying to figure out if April has 30 or 31 days, just say the old rhyme aloud: ""Thirty days has September, April, June, and November."" Then you'll remember that April does indeed have 30 days. Here are some other rhymes to use as memory tools:   ""In fourteen-hundred ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue."" A child can learn the alphabet by singing it to the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,"" which makes the letters rhyme.  , Acronyms are another wonderful tool for remembering a variety of things, from the names of the five Great Lakes to the words used as conjunctions. You can use a popular acronym, or create one for yourself. For example, if you're going to the store and know you only need Butter, Lettuce, Bread, and Unagi, then just create a word out of the first letter of each term: ""BULB"" -- Butter, Unagi, Lettuce, and Bread. Here are some popular acronyms to use:   HOMES. This one is used for remembering the Great Lakes: Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior. ROY G. BIV. This man's name can help you remember the colors of the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. FOIL. This will help you remember how to multiply two binomial terms: First, Outer, Inner, Last. FANBOYS. This acronym can help you remember simple coordinating conjunctions: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So.  , Acrostics are similar to acronyms, except instead of just remembering the acronym, you can remember a new sentence made out of the first letters of a set of words that you have to memorize in a certain order. For example, you can say, ""My very eager mother just sent us noodles."" to learn the order of the planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. You can also make up acrostics of your own. Here are a few more popular acrostics:Every Good Boy Does Fine. This is used for memorizing the lines on the treble music staff: EGBDF. Never Eat Sour Watermelons. This is used for remembering the points of a compass in clockwise order: North, East, South, and West. Another good example is Never Eat Shredded Wheat which also rhymes too. King Philip Can Only Find His Green Slippers. Use this to memorize the order of the classification system: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. Use this to remember the order of operations in mathematics: Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.  , This method has been used since the time of Ancient Greece. This technique requires you to associate things in terms of place or location to help you remember the full set of information. To use this method, simply imagine placing the items you want to remember along a route you're very familiar with, or in specific locations in a familiar room or building. First, pick a familiar path; then, picture the things you want to do or memorize along that path. If you needed to memorize the acronyms HOMES, FANBOYS, and FOIL, you can picture a miniature home, on your front porch, a loud group of fan boys cheering on your stairs, and some foil wrapped around your bed. When you organize a list of information by saying, ""in the first place,"" ""in the second place,"" and so on, you are using a basic version of the method of loci.  , Convince yourself that you do have a good memory that will improve. Too many people get stuck here and convince themselves their memory is bad, that they are just not good with names, that numbers just slip out of their minds for some reason. Erase those thoughts and vow to improve your memory. Celebrate even little achievements to keep yourself motivated.  , Regularly ""exercising"" the brain keeps it growing and spurs the development of new nerve connections that can help improve memory. By developing new mental skills -- especially complex ones such as learning a new language or learning to play a new musical instrument -- and challenging your brain with puzzles and games, you can keep your brain active and improve its physiological functioning.   Try some fun puzzle exercises everyday such as crosswords, Sudoku, and other games which are easy enough for anyone. Get out of your comfort zone and pick something that is new and challenging, which makes you flex your brain muscles. Try to play chess or a fast-paced board game. A large portion of your brain is activated when it learns a new skill. Learning new information is also helpful, but since skills require both the intake and output of information, they exercise a larger portion of your brain.  , Memories are very fragile in the short-term, and distractions can make you quickly forget something as simple as a phone number. The key to avoid losing memories before you can even form them is to be able to focus on the thing to be remembered for a while without thinking about other things, so when you’re trying to remember something, avoid distractions and complicated tasks for a few minutes.  , Often we forget things not because our memory is bad, but rather because our observational skills need work. One common situation where this occurs (and which almost everyone can relate to) is meeting new people. Often we don’t really learn people’s names at first because we aren’t really concentrating on remembering them. You’ll find that if you make a conscious effort to remember such things, you’ll do much better.   One way to train yourself to be more observant is to look at an unfamiliar photograph for a few seconds and then turn the photograph over and describe or write down as many details as you can about the photograph. Try closing your eyes and picturing the photo in your mind. Use a new photograph each time you try this exercise, and with regular practice you will find you’re able to remember more details with even shorter glimpses of the photos.  , You can stimulate more parts of your brain by using as many senses as possible when memorizing information. When a larger part of your brain is active, your ability to trigger your memory banks will increase.  Write it out. The process of writing information by hand stimulates your brain and makes it easier to remember the information later. Typing is far less effective, however. When you do type out information, use a strange font. When you finish, read it back. When something is a struggle to read, you need to concentrate on it more, which can help fix it into your memory more firmly. Rehearse or relate the information. Tell yourself or tell another person the information. Hearing yourself recite the information will involve your sense of hearing. If you need to explain the information to the other person so that he or she can understand it, as well, your memory and understanding will be enhanced even further.  , Change the normal location of things to remember to do something. If you need to remember to take your multivitamins every morning, then put the toaster on its side, and only put it back in its normal place after you've taken your vitamins. Seeing the toaster out of place will remind you that something is off and that there's something you need to remember.If you need to remember something important, such as a person's birthday, just wear your wristwatch on your other wrist. You'll remember that there was something important you had to do when you see that the watch is out of position. The trick is to focus on what you want to remember as you alter the object being used. If you are not focused on the piece of information, you may not be able to associate it with the change later on.  , Flash cards are especially useful for studying. It's essentially a card with a question on one side and the answer on the other. (You can also put two things you want to associate on opposite sides of a flashcard.) In the course of learning a topic, you would have a stack of cards and would go through them testing yourself. Those that you got right you would put to one side and review a few days later.   Place the terms you remembered in one pile, and the ones you need to know in another. Keep going until all of the cards are in the ""know"" pile, even if you need to take breaks. Go back to your flash cards the next day and see if you've still memorized the terms on them.  , Cramming only works to put information in your short-term memory. You may remember the information for your exam the next day, but you will barely recall the unit when it's time to take the final. Spacing out your studying is important because it gives your brain time to encode the information and store it in your long-term memory.  , If you have trouble remembering whether you took your medication every morning, just say, ""I just took my medication!"" right after you took it, to reinforce this idea in your mind. Saying this aloud will help you remember that you did indeed take your medication.   This also works if you're meeting a new person and don't want to forget his name. Just repeat the name naturally after you learn it: ""Hi, Sarah, it's nice to meet you."" This also works to remember an address or a meeting time. Just repeat it aloud to the person who invited you: ""The Grand Tavern at 7? That sounds perfect.""  , When it's time to study or remember something new, switch your breathing pattern to be slower and deeper. Deeper and slower breathing actually changes the way your brain works, by inducing the brain's electrical pulses to switch to Theta waves, which normally occur in your brain in hypnogogic sleep.   To activate your Theta waves, switch your breathing to your lower abdomen - in other words, start breathing deeply from your stomach. Consciously slow your rate of breathing too. After a few moments, you should feel calmer, the Theta waves should be flowing in your brain, and you should be more receptive to remembering new information.  , Use a popular trick out of FDR's playbook for memorizing a person's name. When a person introduces themselves to you, picture them with their name written on their forehead. This will associate the image of that person with their name.  , Some studies suggest that squeezing a stress ball or making a fist with your hand can help you remember a piece of information later.Before memorizing the information, squeeze the stress ball in your dominant hand. For a right-handed person, this would be your right hand. When you need to remember the information, squeeze the stress ball in your opposite hand for at least 45 seconds. This simple action might be enough to help you remember.  , This simple act can stimulate the brain and improve your concentration, especially if you need to remember information for 30 minutes or more.  Some studies have suggested that visual and auditory memory improves when a person chews gum by keeping the individual more focused. When you need to remember something for less than 30 minutes, though, it is actually better not to chew anything.  , Studies show that moving your eyes from side to side for just 30 seconds once a day will align the two parts of your brain and make your memory work more smoothly. Try this trick when you wake up in the morning., Studies show that smelling rosemary can improve your recall. Carry around a sprig of rosemary or smell rosemary oil once a day. The Ancient Greeks even put a spring of rosemary behind their ears on exam days to help them boost their memories., Begin by memorizing this list of ten words. It's simple - because each word rhymes with its number in the list. When you have to remember a lot of things, use these rhyme-number patterns. For example, you have to remember to clean your glasses. The singular for 'glasses' is 'glass', so just remember this. If this is the first thing on your list, picture a gun, which rhymes with one, shooting the glass. By association the original activity should pop back into your head. The list is enclosed below:  Gun Shoe Flea Door Dive Sticks Heaven Date Blind Pen  , Keep items that you frequently need, such as keys and eyeglasses, in the same place every time. Use an electronic organizer or daily planner to keep track of appointments, due dates for bills, and other tasks. Keep phone numbers and addresses in an address book or enter them into your computer or cell phone. Improved organization can help free up your powers of concentration so that you can remember less routine things.   Even if being organized doesn’t improve your memory, you’ll receive a lot of the same benefits (i.e. you won’t have to search for your keys anymore).  , Multitasking may seem like it allows you to get things done faster, but research suggests that it actually causes the brain to slow down overall. Mindfulness allows you to increase your focus, which improves your memory and speeds the brain up.  You need about eight seconds of focus to commit something to memory. When you multitask, you tend to set information aside faster than eight seconds, so you're more likely to forget it. To practice mindfulness, all you really need to do is improve your concentration and spend more time focusing on one task at a time. When you really want to remember a specific piece of information, spend at least eight seconds focusing on that information alone.  , Regular aerobic exercise improves circulation and efficiency throughout the body -- including the brain -- and can help ward off the memory loss that comes with aging. Exercise also makes you more alert and relaxed, and can thereby improve your memory uptake, allowing you to take better mental ""pictures"".   Even just walking for 30 minutes a day is a fantastic form of exercise. Nerve cells release neurotropic factors during exercise, and these proteins trigger other chemicals that promote brain health. Exercise also improves blood flow to the brain, which increases the amount of oxygen your brain receives. Some studies suggest that regular exercise, whether moderate or vigorous, can increase the brain's memory center by one or two percent each year. Without exercise, the memory center will remain stable or may decrease in capacity.  , Chronic stress does in fact physically damage the brain, it can make remembering much more difficult. After prolonged stress, the brain will start to become affected and deteriorate. Stress may never be completely eliminated from one's life, but it definitely can be controlled. Even temporary stresses can make it more difficult to effectively focus on concepts and observe things. Chronic stress can also cause long-term damage to the hippocampus, which is where memories are stored.   Try to relax, regularly practice yoga or other stretching exercises, and see a doctor if you have severe chronic stress as soon as possible.  Meditate for at least 15 minutes a day. This will help you slow down your breathing and relax, and it can improve your focus. Reduce your caffeine intake. Caffeine can make you feel more anxious and stressed. Give yourself a massage or get one from a friend. This will help your body loosen up. Reduce stress by spending more time being social with your friends. Being a more social creature and talking to people more will also improve your memory. Anxiety and depression can also make it difficult to concentrate and remember information. If you are struggling with clinical anxiety or depression disorders, you should work with your doctor to figure out a way to treat these conditions.  ,  Laughing becomes even more beneficial when others are involved. Some studies suggest that socializing with friends, close relatives, and even pets can slow your overall rate of memory decline as you age.  , There are a lot of herbal supplements on the market that claim to improve memory, but none have yet been shown to be effective in clinical tests. A healthy diet, however, contributes to a healthy brain, and foods containing antioxidants -- broccoli, blueberries, spinach, and berries, for example -- and Omega-3 fatty acids appear to promote healthy brain functioning.Feed your brain with such supplements as Thiamine, Niacin and Vitamin B-6. Some of the suggested foods for your brain are green tea, curry, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, walnuts, crab, chickpeas, red meat, blueberries, and healthy fats (including organic butter, olive oil, coconut oil, nuts, avocado, and salmon or other fatty fish). Each of these foods contains antioxidants that may protect your brain and encourage the production of new brain cells. Increase the amount omega-3 fatty acid you consume but decrease omega-6 fats. Omega-3 fats are usually found in salmon and similar animal sources, while omega-6 fats are typically found in processed vegetable oils. You should also avoid sugars and grain carbohydrates since these foods can negatively affect your brain. Saturated fats and high-calorie foods are similarly believed to hinder your memory, especially in the long term. Red wine may improve your memory when consumed in moderation. If you consume more than one glass a day as a woman or two glasses as a man, the alcohol can begin to impair your memory. In small amounts, though, the resveratrol flavonoid in wine can increase blood and oxygen flow to the brain. Grape juice, cranberry juice, fresh berries, and peanuts are said to provide a similar effect. Grazing, or eating 5 or 6 small meals throughout the day instead of 3 large meals, also seems to improve mental functioning (including memory) by limiting dips in blood sugar, which may negatively affect the brain. Make sure it's healthy stuff.  , Studies suggest that low vitamin D may be associated with decreased cognitive performance.When vitamin D receptors in your brain are activated, the nerve growth in your brain increases. Some of the metabolic pathways for vitamin D are located in areas of the brain responsible for forming new memories.  While too much sunlight can cause skin damage, a moderate amount can provide all the vitamin D needed by the average adult. Vitamin D3 supplements are other alternative methods of getting adequate vitamin D.  , Sleeping improves your neuroplasticity—your brain's ability to grow—which enhances the brain's ability to control behavior and memory. The amount of sleep we get affects the brain's ability to recall recently learned information. Getting a good night's sleep -- a minimum of seven hours a night -- may improve your short-term memory and long-term relational memory, according to recent studies conducted at the Harvard Medical School.   Try to get anywhere from 7 to 10 hours of sleep each night. The ideal for most healthy adults is eight hours. Go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time every night. This will make you feel much more rested. Spend at least half an hour reading in bed and winding down before you go to bed. Shut off the TV, your computer, and any other visual stimulants at least an hour before bed. Take catnaps during the day. They can help you recharge your batteries and boost your memory. Your brain also consolidates information into your long-term memory bank during sleep. If you stay awake, this process won't be able to happen.

Your tires also lose about 1 PSI per month, and when the tires are cold (e.g., in the winter), their pressure will decrease due to the thermal contraction of the air. It is recommended to check tires at least monthly, preferably weekly. Having properly inflated tires will also help you avoid uneven wear on the tread.   Some fuel stations have automatic air compressors that stop at a predetermined level. (For safety, double-check pressure with your own gauge, especially if another is suggesting you add a surprisingly large amount of air.) Small permanently-installed valve-stem extensions can allow filling without removing the caps, but check that they are not prone to jamming with foreign matter and leaking. Recommended inflation pressures are for cold tires; it is best to inflate first thing in the morning or you've driven less than two miles so your reading will be accurate. If you have been driving around for a while or it is hot outside, add 3 PSI. Inflate to the pressure recommended by your car's manual or the sticker on your driver-side doorpost. Be aware that the reading stamped on the tire is the maximum tire pressure, not the recommended.; , A properly tuned engine maximizes power and can greatly enhance fuel efficiency. Beware, though, that many tuners will disable efficiency measures when tuning for power.   Be sure you are keeping good spark plugs in the engine, changing the oil on time, making sure the air filter is clean, etc.  , A dirty filter will reduce fuel economy, or make the engine stall when idling. Just like mowing dusty grass, driving dusty dirt roads will clog the air filter: avoid dust clouds.  , This will go a long way to enhancing fuel efficiency.  , Get the lightest car that will serve your needs. Weight is one of the biggest causes for loss of kinetic energy in non-hybrid cars. If you're not shopping for cars, then take any extra weight off of the one you're already driving. If seats that you don't use can be removed, take them out. If you use your trunk as a storage space for heavy things, find another place for them. An extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 1–2%. (Weight is most important in stop-and-go driving. In almost exclusively highway driving, it matters little: once the car is up to speed, it need only push air out of the way.) Don't remove things from the car that you need frequently; instead, make sure these are in the car and readily accessible because wasted trips to retrieve or replace them will be much worse than a little lower mileage.  , Narrow tires have less frontal area, thus reducing aerodynamic drag. Remember, however, that narrow tires have less traction as well (which is why race cars have such wide tires). Do not get a tire that is incompatible with your wheels (use the size tires that came stock on the vehicle), and do not get smaller wheels unless your manufacturer approves.  , These can increase fuel economy by a few percent. However, the difference is not startling or a substitute for proper inflation. It would be wasteful to replace the former tires with these before they are worn out.  , Often the ""check engine light"" coming on is an indication that there is a problem with one of these components. A damaged oxygen sensor may cause your car to have too rich of a fuel mixture, decreasing your fuel mileage by 20% or more.

Programs are still controversial, and marijuana is still classified federally as a Class 1 Drug. If you're interested in using marijuana to treat your condition, find out the laws in your state regarding use by clicking here. States with medical marijuana programs in place include:   West Coast: Arizona, Colorado, California, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington East Coast: Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maine, and Maryland Midwest: Michigan, Minnesota, and Illinois Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia; , You won’t qualify for medical marijuana because you want to use it recreationally, even if recreational use is one of your goals. In most states, medical marijuana is only available to patients with pre-approved conditions, while other states, including California, make medical marijuana more widely available for a variety of conditions.In general, universal pre-approved conditions include:   Chronic and severe pain, including pain from arthritis, migraine headaches, and Crohn’s disease AIDS Chemo-related nausea Hepatitis C Multiple Sclerosis Asthma Epilepsy Alzheimer’s Disease Any terminal illness  , Without a severe illness, most general practitioners will not recommend the use of medical marijuana, unprompted. Talk to your doctor about whether or not using marijuana might be right for your conditions and concerns and discuss your specific conditions that you think might be aided by medical marijuana.   Often, medical marijuana will be recommended as an alternative to more traditional forms of medication. If you've been on other medicines and they haven't helped, this can be a good in-road to talking about medical marijuana with your doctor. Likewise, if you're feeling frustrated with nausea, sleeplessness, or other side-effects as a result of any medications that you're taking, medical marijuana can be an appropriate supplement to other prescriptions that you might be taking.  , Your general practitioner is the best doctor to talk to about any prescription, but many are hesitant to recommend the use of medical marijuana. Often called “420 doctors” or “pot docs,” entrepreneurial doctors in many states with medical programs are available for a consultation fee and few questions asked. If you’re interested in using medical marijuana to relieve things like writers’ cramp and insomnia, say, a 420 doctor is probably the place to go.  , Make an appointment with your doctor or with a doctor who specializes in medical marijuana, and discuss your ailments and your desire to explore medical marijuana. You should walk out with a prescription in hand, which you can use to register as a user with the state and make your purchase from the dispensary.   Prescriptions and recommendations are legally protected under patient confidentiality laws. This doctor's recommendation will not be available to potential employers, law enforcement, and other inquiries., Depending on what state you live in, registering as a medical marijuana user with the state may be mandatory or voluntary, but it’s important to understand the difference and the way in which registration can protect you legally. The purpose of the card is to identify you to vendors and law enforcement as a registered and legal user of medical marijuana.   In California and Maine, patient ID cards are voluntary, meaning that you can take your prescription directly from your doctor to a dispensary, provided you've got a valid state ID. Without a Patient ID card, however, police have no indication that you’re a ""legal"" user, making arrests (if not convictions) somewhat more likely. Nevada, New Hampshire, Maine, Michigan, and Rhode Island will also allow you to purchase medicine if you’ve got a state-issued card from any state, meaning that you’ll also have the option of procuring medicine in multiple states, if you go through the registration process in your own state.  , Many users are concerned that registering as a marijuana user with the state will open them up to prosecution by the DEA, or will affect future employment in other states. Most states have privacy safeguards in place, retaining nothing in the database but a randomized ID number and a photo of the registrant. The DEA has announced publicly that it has no interest in pursuing individual users of medical marijuana.For the most part, passing drug tests will be more important to your ability to secure future employment. While the legality of medicinal marijuana is in a complicated gray area, registration should in no way affect your future employment.  , In most states, you'll register for your medical marijuana ID card at the office of the department of public health in your county, and you'll need to register and fill out the paperwork in person. You'll need to bring a state-issued form of identification, like a driver's license, as well as your doctor's recommendation.   To apply, you'll need to be able to prove that you're a resident in the state and county in which you're applying. If you don't have a valid state-issued ID, you can still apply, provided you've got some form of identification that's up-to-date and legal in another state. You can use bills, leases, or other documents to prove your residency in the state.  , Fill out the paperwork in person and submit it to the department of public health. In most states, there should be a waiting period and a fee associated with the application, usually somewhere in the neighborhood of $50. More specifically, you can find out the requirements for your state by visiting the website of the department of public health or visiting in person.  , When you visit a dispensary, when you talk to your doctor, and anytime you’re talking about your purchases, it’s a good idea to get in the habit of referring to it as medicine, not “weed” or “pot” or other slang terms. This is the approved dispensary term.   Medical marijuana activists have done lots of work to change the vocabulary and the connotations with marijuana. The more you work to refer to it as medicine, the more it will be accepted as medicine. Calling it ""pot"" reinforces the stigma that you're using recreational drugs, not legal medicine.  , Most dispensaries are cooperative organizations registered with the state to provide high-quality plants and medicine to registered patients. After receiving a doctor's recommendation and a state-issued ID card, you can visit the dispensary closest to you to become a member and make your purchases. Often, dispensaries will also provide you with a membership card, making it easy to recognize you as a registered patient.  , There are many ways of consuming medical marijuana, and some may be more appropriate than others, depending on your needs and your conditions. Getting informed about the different products and techniques will help make the dispensary less intimidating.Combustible flowers, oils, and concentrates are consumed in the traditional way, by smoking. Many dispensaries will offer pre-rolled cigarettes and different strains of loose marijuana flowers at a variety of price-points. Non-combustible hardware like vaporizers are also available at many dispensaries, for patients interested in healthier smoking options. Non-combustible consumption means that the THC–the active ingredient in marijuana–is vaporized and inhaled, without the harmful carcinogens from the smoke. Edibles, tinctures, and drinks are extremely user-friendly. You can buy cookies, brownies, and drinkable THC-infused products to medicate your condition. If you're not a fan of smoking marijuana, this is the best option for most users. Topical sprays, creams, and analgesics are also available in some dispensaries. These localize THC that can be absorbed through the skin for topical pain-relief treatments.  , Many dispensaries also sell plant-starts and seeds for use in home cultivation. Registering as a patient also allows you to grow a small amount of marijuana for your own consumption, so if you live in a rural area without easy access to a dispensary, this option may be better for you. Depending on what state you live in, the amount of plants you’re able to grow will vary, but it’s usually considerable.  , Medical marijuana users are in a somewhat strange position of being permitted to do something in the state that's illegal at the federal level, so it's especially important to know your rights and your responsibilities when it comes to using medicine.   Your records as a registered user of medical marijuana fall under patient confidentiality and customer confidentiality laws in most states, and it's illegal for employees to consult the data found in your ""file."" There should be no connection between your driver's license and your SSN and your medical marijuana registration.If you're pulled over, you do not need to present your medical marijuana ID card preemptively, unless you're being cited for a marijuana-related offense. You do not need to permit a search without probable cause. Patient-confidentiality laws guarantee that doctor's recommendations will be kept private from all law enforcement inquiries. The fact that you've been recommended to use a legal drug by a medical professional is no one's business but your own.  , Even if it's legal, strictly speaking, you still need to take a lot of responsibility to keep yourself safe. Use your medicine in private, never smoke in areas where smoking is prohibited, and   Don't take medical marijuana across state lines, especially into states without medical marijuana programs in place. Any time you're transporting cannabis, keep your medical ID card handy and never ever smoke while you're driving. Keep medical marijuana in airtight containers and in the trunk. The smell of marijuana counts as probable cause for search. THC stays in your system for days after use, meaning that other traffic infractions can carry with it an added ""operating while intoxicated"" charge, even if you're no longer ""high."" Never drive after smoking marijuana. Treat your medical marijuana use the same as you might treat the consumption of alcohol or other prescription drugs. Do it in the safety of your own home.","['doctor', 'alternative medications', 'id card', 'medicine', 'application', 'word', 'products', 'secondary opinion', 'rights', 'public health department', 'activists', 'dispensary', 'sure medical marijuana', 'arrest', 'interest', 'conditions', 'state', 'recommendation', 'concerns', 'identification', 'prescription', 'id database', 'dispensary close']"
"['decide what values you want to enforce', 'let them take some responsibility', 'take a break', 'give them space', 'have reasonable expectations']",How to Calm a Teenager2," Your family, like most families, may have behaviors and actions you value. As your teen begins to push back against these values and your expectations, you may wish to decide which values you want to enforce above all others, and perhaps relax on your enforcement of other behaviors.Write down a list of what you value most in your family. It could be actions like being generous, showing kindness, living your faith, or being of service to others. Decide which of these values you will demand your teen to uphold, and decide that you will be more flexible about others. For example, you may decide to make “showing kindness” an enforced value, but perhaps could be more flexible on “living your faith,” letting your teen skip religious services now and again. Tell your teen what you expect of them. You could say, “In our house, we value family above everything else. I’m not going to let you off the hook for Sunday dinners with Grandma. I will negotiate with you on other expectations, but not on family activities.”  , Give your teenager a certain amount of freedom to make their own decisions. They are rapidly approaching adulthood when they will need to hold themselves accountable, so give them the opportunity now to learn some skills under your watchful eye.   Consider giving your teenager more financial responsibility. They may have a part-time job, or perhaps you give them an allotted amount of spending money per week. Teens enjoy being able to manage their own savings, and this is a great time for them to learn about managing money. Don't interfere if you think they are making a stupid purchase -- this is all part of learning about money.Let your teenager wear what they want, within reason and their school’s dress code. Back off if they want to dye their hair or shave their head. It’s part of them expressing themselves.  , If your teenager is irate, any attempts to restrict or discipline them will only be counterproductive. Give him or her some time to cool off. If the situation calls for punishment, it can be dealt later.Calmly approach them and continue the discussion after a while, later in the day, after both of you have had time to calm down. You could say, “Now that we’ve both had a chance to cool off, I want to talk to you about what you did.”  , Adolescence is about becoming independent from your parents and determining your identity as an individual. Make sure you are giving them the space they need to grow and figure themselves out, and alone time as necessary. While maintaining a solid connection is important, be sure not to smother them.   Be conscious of the importance of your teenager’s social life right now. Allow them time with their friends. Be aware of who they are hanging out with and where, but give them more freedom if you believe they are trustworthy., Don’t expect your teenager to behave like an adult all of the time. Even though they may look more grown up, they still have a growing brain. Understand they will make mistakes and will sometimes act like a much younger child. If your teenager is working hard, doing their best, and is a kind person, they are doing just fine.Don't compare the teen to others. They are likely already doing this all the time to themselves, they don’t need someone else chiming in! Don’t say things like, “I wish you were more like Mary. She gets such good grades!” Instead, you could say something like, “I’d like to see you put more effort in on your math homework.”  ","['reasonable expectations', 'break', 'values', 'responsibility', 'space']"

Consider the following common landlord-tenant disputes:Your landlord won’t make necessary repairs. For example, your toilet might be backed up, or your apartment might lack sufficient heat. Landlords need to keep their apartments in a habitable condition. Your landlord enters your apartment without permission. Typically, your landlord must give you written notice of when they will enter. Your landlord has damaged your property. For example, your landlord might not have kept the roof in good repair. If it caves in and damages your property, you can sue. Your landlord’s carelessness has injured you. The legal term for carelessness is “negligence.” For example, your landlord might have allowed the stairs to rot. If you break a leg climbing the stairs, you can sue for your injury. Your landlord is retaliating against you for exercising a legal right. For example, they might not renew your lease because you tried to form a tenant's union or because you complained to the housing authorities about your landlord. Your landlord isn’t following the lease. The lease is a binding contract, and your landlord made promises to do certain things. You can sue if your landlord fails to live up to their promises. Your landlord has discriminated against you. It’s against the law to discriminate against someone because of their gender, race, color, religion, national origin, familial status, or disability.In some states or cities, it’s also illegal to discriminate because of sexual orientation.; , You’re an important witness to any dispute. As soon as possible, write out your memories. Try to be as detailed as possible and sign the paper.   For example, if your landlord enters your apartment without permission, then note the dates and times. If your landlord won’t make repairs, then write down the date you first noticed the problem. Also summarize any oral conversations you’ve had with your landlord. Write down what they said and what you said.  , Visual evidence is helpful since it shows the judge what you are complaining about.For example, if a stairwell is missing a step, take pictures. If you have a vermin infestation, record mice running around.   You won’t be able to get visual evidence for everything, but it’s helpful if you have it.  , When you sue, you need to present evidence to the judge. Preserve documents that might be useful. Consider saving the following:   all communications with your landlord copy of your lease any receipts if you had to replace damaged items medical reports and medical bills, if you were injured police reports  , Explain what you want them to do to resolve the dispute. In some states, you need to send your landlord a letter and give them a chance to correct the problem before the court will let you sue. Send your letter certified mail, return receipt requested, so that you have proof it was received.   There are sample letters online. Remember to maintain a professional tone, no matter how angry you may be. Nevertheless, be firm. You are not in the wrong—your landlord is. Identify how the landlord has violated your rights. Provide dates and refer to any communications you have had. For example, if you sent your landlord an email about a leaky pipe, remind them of the date. Tell the landlord what needs to be done and give them a deadline. For example, a landlord should make urgent repairs immediately. If you want monetary compensation, tell the landlord how much. Provide any supporting documentation to back up your request for money. Close the letter by reminding your landlord that you’ll sue if they don’t respond favorably to your request.  , Your landlord must follow many laws. If they break those laws, then it’s best to get the government on your side. Depending on your circumstances, you can call the following:   If your landlord won’t make repairs, then you can call the housing inspector. Call if the apartment’s current condition threatens your health or safety.For example, you wouldn’t call if your landlord is refusing to paint your walls, but you would if there isn’t sufficient heat or hot water. Find the number in the phone book. If your landlord has discriminated against you, report the violation to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) here: https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/housing_discrimination. Click on “Housing Discrimination Complaint.” HUD can investigate and bring a suit on your behalf., You can save time and money by resolving the dispute without going to court. Consider mediation. Some courthouses offer mediation programs, so stop in and check.   In mediation, you and your landlord meet with a third person (the mediator) to talk about your dispute. Mediators are skilled at getting each side to listen to the other and reaching a voluntary agreement.You might have to compromise, but many people walk away from mediation feeling satisfied. Resolving the dispute is ideal if you want to continue to rent from the landlord.  , Everyone’s situation is different, and only a qualified lawyer can assess your situation and advise you about how to sue. You can find a lawyer who specializes in landlord-tenant disputes by contacting your local or state bar association.   Costs may be a concern. If so, check if there is legal aid nearby.Legal aid provides free or reduced-fee legal services to people with low incomes. Visit the Legal Services Corporation’s website: http://www.lsc.gov. If you’re suing for discrimination, then you might be able to hire a private attorney. You can win attorneys’ fees if you are successful.Private attorneys might also represent you on “contingency,” meaning you only pay if they win the lawsuit., You can’t just bring a lawsuit anywhere. Instead, closely analyze your situation to find the correct courthouse to sue in. Consider the following:   If you want to sue for discrimination, then you can sue in either federal or state court.You can find your federal district at this website: http://www.uscourts.gov/court-locator. All other lawsuits can be brought in state court. Sue in the district or county where your apartment is located. Small claims court might also be an option for those suing in state court. In every state, small claims courts handle cases involving small dollar amounts. The maximum amount differs by state. You should consider suing in small claims court because the process is usually streamlined. You don’t need a lawyer., A “complaint” starts the lawsuit. In this document, you identify yourself and the landlord. You also describe the dispute in sufficient detail and ask the judge for some remedy, usually monetary compensation.A complaint is a formal document, so research how it is supposed to look and what should be included.   If you hire a lawyer, they can draft a complaint for you. Make sure to review it before the lawyer files it. In small claims court, there is probably a “fill in the blank” form you can use. Also, some regular state courts have fillable forms, so check their website. If there’s no form, find sample complaints in books at the library or online. Use a sample as a guide when drafting your own.  , Once you’ve signed the complaint, make a copy for your records and a copy for your landlord. You might also need to file several copies with the original. Take everything to the court clerk’s office and ask to file.   The clerk will stamp your copies with the filing date. You’ll probably have to pay a filing fee. Call ahead of time to check the amount and acceptable methods of payment. If you’re low income, you might qualify for a fee waiver. Ask the clerk for the form and fill it out.  , Your landlord gets a chance to respond, so you need to give them a copy of your complaint. You may also need to serve another document called a “summons,” which you can fill out at the clerk’s office.Generally, you can give your landlord notice in the following ways:   Have someone hand deliver the documents. For example, you can have someone 18 or older give them the papers, provided this person isn’t part of the case. Alternately, you can hire your county sheriff or a local process server to make delivery. However, you can’t hand deliver the papers yourself. Mail the papers. In small claims court, in particular, you can use first class mail to send papers to your landlord. Use other methods. Check your court’s rules.  , Whoever serves your landlord usually must complete a form, called a “proof of service” or “affidavit of service.” They will return this form to you. Make a copy for your records and file the original with the court.  , Your landlord gets to respond by filing an “answer.” You’ll receive a copy, so read it closely. Identify your landlord’s defense. For example, your landlord might disagree with your factual assertions. If you claim they entered your apartment twice without permission, they might deny the charge.   Your landlord might also turn around and countersue you. This is called a “counterclaim.”For example, if you haven’t been paying your rent, then your landlord can sue you for what you owe.  , The fact-finding stage of a lawsuit is called “discovery.” Discovery is usually simplified in small claims court. For example, you might turn over key documents, such as a copy of your lease, but not be entitled to anything else.   However, in regular civil court, discovery can be fairly long. You might have to answer questions under oath in a deposition. You may also depose your landlord or other witnesses. You’ll probably also have to answer written questions, called “interrogatories” and “requests for admission.”You can also ask your landlord for information that might be helpful. What you ask for will depend on the circumstances of your case. For example, if you are suing for racial discrimination, you might ask your landlord how many African-American tenants they have rented to over the past ten years. If you feel overwhelmed by the discover process, reach out to a lawyer. Many lawyers can provide “unbundled legal services,” meaning you can hire them to handle discrete tasks. You retain control of the case, but the lawyer coaches you, drafts a legal document, or handles a deposition. Unbundled legal services are a good way to keep legal costs low.  , Without witnesses, it’s a “he said, she said” situation. Accordingly, find other people who can go to court to testify on your behalf. Tell them the court date and make sure they can attend.   For example, if your apartment lacks heat, a friend who has been in your apartment can back up your story.If your witnesses won’t attend voluntarily, serve them with a subpoena. You should apply for a subpoena with the court before your hearing date.  , Landlord-tenant disputes are handled differently, depending on the court. In some courts, you’ll have a full-fledged trial. In others, you’ll have a hearing, which is less formal. To know what you’re getting into, go to the courthouse and observe a hearing. Bring a notepad to take notes.  , You don’t need to wear a suit to court, but you should look neat and clean. Remember that the judge is judging you from the first moment you step into the courtroom. If possible, wear dress pants and a dress shirt. Women may also wear a conservative dress.   Leave shorts, tank tops, T-shirts, and crop tops at home. Only wear jeans if you don’t have any other long pants.  , As the person suing, you go first. Speak clearly and slowly so the judge can hear you. Avoid talking to the landlord. Instead, direct all remarks to the judge.   You can use notes, but you shouldn’t read a written script. Use your own words and explain the situation as if you were talking to your boss. If you have witnesses, tell the judge who they are and what they will be testifying about. You can ask them questions, and your landlord can cross-examine them. If the judge has questions, they might ask them as well., Your landlord goes second. It is important that you stay calm and not interrupt them.Avoid eye rolling or comments while your landlord is speaking. Remember that you will have a chance to respond to anything your landlord says.   Your landlord might call witnesses. You’ll also have a chance to ask them questions. When your landlord says something you disagree with, write a note so that you remember to raise it with the judge. As best as you can, ignore personal attacks. Your landlord might say you’re loud or that your children don’t behave. Unless these issues are related to the lawsuit, ignore them.  , After each side presents their case, the judge will rule for one of you. Generally, the judge should rule from the bench unless the case was very complicated, in which case you might get a written decision later.   If you lose, consider whether to appeal. Talk to a lawyer if you don’t have one. Appeals are time-consuming and costly.If you choose to appeal, you must file a Notice of Appeal quickly, usually within 30 days, though the precise amount of time will depend on the court. Your landlord can also appeal if they lose.

"['join or donate to anti-animal cruelty organizations', 'start a neighborhood watch', 'report animal cruelty', 'be a model for others']",How to Help Stop Cruelty Towards Animals3," There are a litany of organizations available you can join or donate to that are dedicated to reducing cruelty towards animals worldwide. Do some research and find which organization appeals to your views.   The Humane Society of America is one of the world's largest animal advocacy organizations. They target puppy mills, animal fighting, factory farming, seal slaughter, horse cruelty, and the slaughterhouse trade. The organization works through both large-scale political initiatives and hands-on efforts to rescue and care for unwanted animals.The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is another one of the better known animal advocacy organizations. Much like the Humane Society of America, they oppose most forms of cruelty like slaughterhouses and puppy mills and also help curb animal population by encouraging spaying and neutering of house pets. They also encourage the development of no-kill shelters and provide practical assistance such as transporting adopted animals to new homes.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a well-known but somewhat controversial animal rights organization. PETA focuses primarily on factory farms, the clothing trade, laboratory testing of animals, and use of animals in the entertainment industry. PETA often conducts investigations of companies and labs and encourages direct political action in the form of protests, petitioning, and boycotts.PETA, however, has met criticism for being more dedicated to publicity stunts than actually reducing cruelty to animals. In 2013, allegations surfaced that PETA had euthanized many of the rescued animals at their Virginia headquarters.You can also find a local animal shelter in your area and volunteer there.  , If no existing organization appeals to you personally, you can always start a neighborhood watch in your area. Invite your friends and neighbors to get to know the animals in your area and keep an eye out for suspicious behavior.   Be aware of the animals in your area. By being vigilant, and encouraging others to do the same, you'll be likely to notice potential problems, such as a formerly friendly dog suddenly becoming aggressive or skittish around people.There are many signs of animal abuse. Physical signs include collars that are too tight, open wounds or signs of recently healed wounds, fur infested with fleas or ticks, patches of missing skin or rashes, and extreme thinness. Pay attention to the animal's environment. Are they tied up alone frequently? Are they kept outside despite poor weather conditions, like intense heat or cold? Is an animal kept in a small kennel, or one crowded with many other animals, for extended periods? Encourage all members of your watch to stay vigilant, and if you notice any of the above signs of cruelty report it to your group and decide as a group how to proceed.  , Animal cruelty is a crime, and if you see abuse happening do not hesitate to report it to the proper authorities.   Where to report cruelty depends on your state. Contacting the local humane society is a good first step, as the workers there usually know what law agency to contact. You can also visit a local police station and ask for help.When you know who to contact, provide concise written statements that includes the dates of the incident or incidents, and any other witnesses besides yourself. If possible, get photographic evidence of the abuse., One of the most important things you can do to endorse animal welfare is being a model for friends, family members, and co-workers.   Share your views. Do not be shy about explaining your opinions on animal cruelty and welfare. Many people are not informed about the conditions of slaughterhouses, animal testing facilities, and puppy mills. If animals come up in conversation, take this as an opportunity to keep others informed. Use social media to your advantage. Post lists of animal-based ingredients hidden in many products, links to petitions to end animal testing, and local listings from your animal shelter of dogs at-risk for euthanasia. If you have kids, talk to them about treating animals with kindness and respect. Young children often do not differentiate between a living dog and a plush dog. Explain to them animals have feelings and thoughts similar to our own, and need to be treated with compassion and care.

"['identify the different characteristics of organic seeds', 'buy organic seeds locally', 'purchase organic seeds online']",How to Buy Organic Seeds," There are a variety of seeds that qualify as ""organic."" For many gardeners, the main characteristic of an ""organic seed"" is that it is grown in organic soil and not treated with any pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or herbicides. Identification labels for organic seeds will signify whether a seed is originally propagated from an organic plant. Look for labels on seed packets, in catalogs or online.   Look for untreated seeds. A ""U"" will identify seeds that are untreated, meaning they have had no chemical or synthetic fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides. Check for an ""O,"" which identifies organic seeds, or those that have been taken from organically grown plants. Look for open-pollinated seeds. Open pollination refers to seeds that have been pollinated by natural means, either by birds, bees, wind or through self-pollination (seeds that are naturally capable of reproducing themselves). These seeds will be labeled with an ""OP."" Look for an ""H."" This stands for heritage (or heirloom) seeds, which carry qualities of a particular plant that has been cultivated. Heritage seeds are those that have been carried down from a particular seed that the grower felt created a healthy, desirable plant. Heritage seeds are usually the result of cross-pollination from 2 types of seeds that created the new cultivar.; , Choosing locally grown organic seed will allow for better adaptation to your soil and garden environment.   Shop at local nurseries or choose from local seed catalogs. Look in the phone book or online for nurseries or landscapers in your area. They will be able to tell you if they sell organic seeds, and they often will recommend seeds based on local growing conditions. Most nurseries, and even garden departments at home improvement stores, carry seed catalogs from top seed distributors. Ask fellow gardeners what they have enjoyed growing from organic seed, or ask your local farmers and vendors at the farmer's markets. Farmers and gardeners in your area will have the expertise to recommend what type of seeds have grown best for them, as well as information on special heritage or heirloom seeds. Many farmers who grow organically have created their own heirloom seeds, and may even sell or trade them along with their produce.  , The Internet allows for many seed distributors, co-ops and other organic plant producers to provide consumers with purely organic seeds that they have certified. You also will have the benefit of browsing through many varieties of seeds online. Recently seeds are also sold in general marketplaces like eBay or garden marketplaces like MySeedz.   Start a search. Begin by browsing keywords, such as ""organic seeds"" or ""certified organic."" Look for certified organic seeds. A website that is selling seeds should provide certification for organic requirements. Although requirements vary, a reputable seed distributor will have the certification listed. In the United States, for example, there will be a certification number provided. This ensures that you are purchasing seeds that are organic and untreated. Search for online vendors that have been established. Signs of longtime vendors include their age of operation, whether they are licensed with the Better Business Bureau, and if they are a common name in gardening or organic food production. Many organic food websites will have links to vendors who are reputable. Established vendors in the seed business also usually offer a variety of plants for sale.

Once you’ve obtained the necessary items, perform the following instructions right before you go to bed:Apply the lotion to your stomach and waist area in a thick layer. Don’t massage the lotion too much into your skin. Wrap the clear plastic wrap around your waist, on top of where you put the lotion. You may need to wrap the plastic two to three times around your waist. The plastic wrap should not be loose, but should be tight enough that it doesn’t fall off. Wrap the elastic bandage around your waist on top of the plastic wrap. Secure the bandage to your body by tucking the end into the portion already wrapped around. Sleep with the wrap on all night and remove it in the morning. You’ll likely notice a small difference in your waist size, but note it’s only temporary.; , Corsets come in many different types, depending on what you’re trying to accomplish. ‘Real’ corsets designed to trim your waistline have steel boning and multiple layers of non-stretchy fabrics. You can buy a ready-made corset at a lingerie store, or you can have one custom made for you.Corsets can help your waist look 2 – 4” smaller just by wearing them. Corsets, because they’re tight, can also help you eat less as you’ll feel full faster. Alternatively, you can also try wearing shapewear, which can help make you look thinner as well, but uses a different material than corsets. Plus you can buy shapewear that’s also underwear, camisoles, etc., The key to dressing so you look thinner is to avoid items like capris, pleated pants, long baggy shorts or shapeless skirts that only go down to your calf. Ensure the clothes you wear fit you properly, and choose items like the following:Dark-coloured jeans or pants that go down to your ankle or 1-2” below your ankle; long shirts, blazers, or non-baggy sweaters; knee-length pencil skirts; or fitted A-line skirts. Maxi skirts. These are another great option to make you look thinner because they give you a longer vertical line and make your legs look longer. Solid colours work best. Avoid skirts with pleats, big pockets, layers and thick elastic waistbands. Pair a maxi skirt with a fitted top and heels. Jeans that have a higher-rise or waist. Lower-rise jeans, while stylish, unfortunately can create the muffin top look around your waist, which does not look at all flattering. As with many other clothing pieces, higher-rise jeans make your legs look longer, which in turn makes you look thinner. Tuck your shirt into your jeans as well. Skinny belts to cinch shirts, dresses and even coats. This helps to define your natural waistline and shows off your curves. Try wearing heels. To help make your legs look slimmer and elongate your whole body, wear heels that are at least 2.5” or taller. It also helps to wear heels with a somewhat pointed toe, as opposed to a square toe.Just don't wear them all the time — wearing high heels repeatedly for prolonged periods can cause serious harm to your body and your posture.  , There are several colours and patterns you can choose for your clothing that will help make you look thinner, especially in the waist area.Black is a classic colour that can go with just about everything. But in addition to being a good colour choice for coordination purposes, it’s also a great colour choice for making yourself look thinner. Black (and dark blue, green and red) can create an illusion of a long vertical line which thins the body. Vertical stripes create a similar illusion that the colour black does, and can be helpful when you’re trying to make your middle look smaller. If you wear vertical stripes on pants or skirts, it helps make your legs look longer and thinner, which thins out your middle and upper body too.  , If you have a particular part of your body that you don’t like and would like to keep somewhat hidden, wear dark colours in that area. On the other hand, if you have an area you’d like to show off, use a bright colour., Unfortunately most women end up wearing bras that are the wrong size for them. When a bra is the wrong size, it can give you curves in all the wrong places. Your breasts should be a proper height above your waist, which helps to make you look leaner.Before selecting any new bras, get measured properly by a professional in the lingerie department of a department store. They should also be able to point out other tricks you can look for in a bra.  , Good posture can make you look thinner, but it can also make you feel better. Standing and sitting with good posture helps relieve tense muscles in your body and can make you feel more relaxed.Evaluate your posture by standing with your back against a wall without any shoes on. Make sure you push your body such that your heels and bum are pressed against the wall behind you. Place one of your hands between the wall and your lower back, around your waist area. If the space is larger than the width of your hand, you need to work on your posture. Good posture when you’re standing includes: keeping your shoulders back and in a relaxed position; pulling in your abdomen; keeping your feet hip-width apart; standing such that you are balanced equally on both feet; not locking your knees.Good posture when you’re sitting includes: choosing a chair where both of your feet can rest comfortably on the ground; choosing a chair that allows you to sit with your back against the back of the chair — place a pillow behind your lower back if necessary to feel comfortable; holding your head straight up with your chin tucked in a little bit; keeping your back and neck straight, but comfortable; keeping your shoulders relaxed and comfortable.

Good individual sports include: Tennis, swimming, cross-country running, athletics, dance, walking, running and ice skating.  , If you're going to be a sporty girl, you need to be good at your sports.Go to the field and play around with friends, take some clinics even. Watch the professionals on TV to learn more about techniques and special skills.  , Sporty girls should really be fit. Follow a healthy diet, do regular exercise, and get regular health check-ups.   Do your chores on time. Chores help you to stay fit and contribute to living in a well-run household.  , Of course, sports and friends are the center of your life! Organize little scrimmages, and games for you and your buds! Head to the movies, the mall, the park, the beach, the pool, coffee shops, smoothies, food, sleepovers, parties, and other fun stuff,   Sporty girls tend to be popular.

The term ""hysterectomy"" is an umbrella term for all of these procedures, so it is important to understand which type of operation will be happening to you.A supracervical or subtotal hysterectomy involves the removal of the upper part of the uterus only, while the cervix stays in place. A total hysterectomy involves the removal of the whole uterus and cervix. A radical hysterectomy involves the removal of the whole uterus, tissue on the sides of the uterus, the cervix, and the top part of the vagina. This is typically only done when cancer is present. Your hysterectomy may or may not involve removal of the ovaries (a procedure called ""oophorectomy"").; , An open surgery, or abdominal hysterectomy, is the most common type, comprising 65% of procedures. This method involves a 5–7 inch abdominal incision, through which the appropriate organs are removed. An MIP hysterectomy (or minimally invasive procedure) may be vaginal (where an incision is made inside the vagina, through which the organs are removed — known as a transvaginal hysterectomy) or laparoscopic (which is a surgery done using a laparoscope, through one or more small tiny incisions, often through the belly button). Sometimes MIP hysterectomies will be a combination of vaginal/laparoscopic techniques.An open surgery hysterectomy usually results in a three-day hospital stay. MIP hysterectomies generally involve reduced hospital stays, quicker recovery times, less scarring, and a lowered risk of infection. An MIP hysterectomy results in a three to four week recovery period to resume full activity, compared to a five to six week recovery with an abdominal procedure. Not all women will be suited for an MIP hysterectomy. Factors such as scar tissue, obesity, and health status can all affect whether or not an MIP is good choice for you.  , A hysterectomy is considered a ""moderate risk"" procedure.Fortunately, most women who have this surgery experience no complications; however, as with any medical procedure, some complications do occur for a small percentage of women. It is important to educate yourself on what could happen, even though the risk is small. Some complications include:Urinary incontinence Vaginal prolapse Fistula formation Chronic pain Blood clots Infection Frequent urination Heavy bleeding (hemorrhage) Early menopause Complications due to general anesthesia  , The most common physical result of a hysterectomy is the early onset of menopause. If your ovaries will be removed during the procedure, you will experience the onset of menopause right away. If your ovaries will remain, you will still likely experience menopause at an earlier age than you would have otherwise. Additionally, after your hysterectomy, you will be advised to abstain from sexual activity or heavy lifting for a minimum of six weeks. On the bright side, after the recommended recovery period, most women report an immediate relief from reproductive pain, problems, and discomfort.  , Before your surgery, gather enough information to feel comfortable about the surgery. Generate a list of questions for your doctor, and talk to them until you feel all of your concerns have been answered. You may want to discuss any medications or hormone therapy you'll need, the effects of this surgery on your sex life, the best ways to accomplish a full recovery, and any other elements that you just aren't sure about or don't understand completely. , Individuals who smoke have been shown to have a much more difficult time recovering from surgery. Take this as a great opportunity to stop smoking for good. Even if you do not want to stop smoking indefinitely, the American College of Surgeons has determined that quitting four weeks prior to your surgery, and staying smoke-free for four weeks afterward has been shown to decrease your rate of wound complications by 50%.Choose a ""quit date"" and mark it on your calendar. Let you friends and family know about your ""quit date."" Discuss your decision to quit with your physician for support and possible prescription therapies. Discard any cigarettes, ashtrays, etc. from your home, office, and car. Purchase some ""oral replacements,"" such as gum, candy, and/or toothpicks. Decide if you will use some form of nicotine replacement (gum, patch, etc.). Seek out a support system, such as class to quit smoking, Nicotine Anonymous, or a family member who has successfully quit smoking.  , As with smoking, patients who are very overweight have been shown to have more difficulty with recovery. This is the time to take control of your health and come out of your surgery feeling strong. If you are overweight, talk to your doctor about healthy ways to trim down before your surgery.Start focusing on eating healthy foods, above restricting unhealthy foods. Try to make sure you are getting 5 serving of vegetables each day. Work on burning more calories — try to get active! This may simply be taking a walk around the block, riding a bike in your neighborhood, or putting on some music and dancing up a sweat. Follow these methods for one week and see if you have experienced any weight loss. If you have not, begin reducing your caloric intake by 100–200 calories per day, by cutting out food with processed sugar or white flour. Dropping just 5 to 10 lbs. prior to your surgery can have very positive effects on your recovery.  , You will want to be well-rested before you head into surgery. Improve your health and reduce your stress by aiming for eight hours of sleep per night for the month leading up to your surgery. If you feel like taking an additional nap during the day, go right ahead., This month is all about getting into the best possible shape so that you tackle your recovery with strength and well being. Regardless of your current weight, this includes eating a well-balanced diet of veggies, fruit, lean proteins, and whole grains. If this is new to you, you want to talk to your doctor for support.Try to consume five servings of vegetables per day (like bell peppers, cauliflower, or green beans). If you are having trouble fitting all those servings in, try making a smoothie with frozen fruit and spinach or broccoli. You'll be surprised how good it will taste! Focus on eating whole grains (like brown rice, quinoa, oats, or millet) instead of processed flour foods (like pasta, white bread, or tortillas). Simply boil your grains in water, broth, milk, tomato sauce, or almost any other liquid. Avoid foods with processed sugar, like soft drinks and dessert items.  , Another great way to prepare is to make appropriate arrangements at work. You will want to make sure everything is squared away, so that you can take some time to rest and recover, without worry. Speak to the people you work with and take any necessary steps to prepare for your absence., Depending on which medications you take regularly (if any), your doctor may advise you to change dosages or even refrain from certain meds in the days leading up to your surgery. Be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions with regard to medication., As you head into the week of your surgery, make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water). This will help prevent constipation, which can be a side effect of surgery. Try to consume at least 8 glasses of water per day., Ask your doctor to provide you with any prescriptions you will need after the surgery, and get these filled ahead of time. This makes them available for you as soon as you’re done with your surgery, and it is one less thing to worry about during your recovery., Your ability to drive will be curtailed for one to two weeks after your surgery or longer in some cases. Make arrangements for a ride home from the hospital, as well as any place you may need to travel during your recovery., A few days before you head into surgery, it is a great idea to head to the grocery store, stock your pantry, and do a bit a food prep for yourself. You may consider preparing some freezer meals. This way, you’ll be able to nourish yourself and stay healthy without a great deal of effort.  , You are going to want to bring a few items with you to the hospital. Pack your toothbrush, hairbrush, comb, shampoo, and deodorant, as well as an easy-to-wear change of clothes for the trip home.   Bring sanitary supplies. Pack a robe and some slip-on slippers. Bring some entertainment, like books, a tablet, or a laptop. Also remember to bring your charger for your electronic items. Bring eyeglasses, hearing aids and dentures if needed.  , Eating healthy is always important, but avoiding heavy, greasy, unhealthy foods for a day or so leading into your surgery is especially helpful. This can minimize any digestive problems associated with anesthesia, and help your recovery go well., You will want to gather up any medical records, insurance information, a list of any medications you are taking, and your personal identification. If you have had any pre-op screenings or blood tests, you may want to bring the results of those with you as well., In most instances, you cannot have solid foods or liquids after 12:00am, the night before surgery. It is also possible for your doctor to prescribe a “bowel cleansing oral solution.” It is crucial for you to follow your doctor’s instructions when it comes to these pre-surgery preparations., You should not be wearing any jewelry when you undergo surgery, so go ahead and remove any while you are still at home. If you have a piece of jewelry that you cannot remove (such as a wedding ring that has been on for many years), speak to you doctor before cutting the jewelry or taking other drastic measures.","['hysterectomy', 'doctor', 'open surgery', 'differences', 'type', 'mip', 'instructions', 'balanced diet', 'food', 'meals', 'rest', 'overnight bag', 'arrangements', 'hysterectomies', 'weight', 'transportation', 'jewelry', 'drink plenty', 'light', 'additional information', 'work', 'fluids', 'risks', 'time', 'medication', 'smoking', 'medical information', 'bowel preparation', 'plenty', 'post-op prescriptions']"

However, this does not mean that you need to be alone. There is a difference between being on your own and being lonely; what you choose to do and who you choose to see will make all the difference.; , Accepting your situation allows you to do something about it. Making plans for the future, which could be another four decades or so, is a vital activity for giving you back a sense of direction and purpose.  , While men in their 50s may be considered esteemed and a ""good catch"", women in this age group often feel invisible and less desirable. Media messaging reinforces the invisibility of older women, through such things as pairing older men with very young co-stars in Hollywood movies, rampant coverage of young female starlets in magazines, yet not showing older women anywhere near as much, while showing older men well into their 90s as powerful and even sexy, and so forth. These are images principally pushed by the advertising and entertainment industries and they do not reflect reality. Whatever your gender and age, you remain an important and valued member of society. Do not allow yourself to feel devalued by the incessant drive to sell aspirational products and lifestyles.  , Embrace this time of your life. Be positive about everything. Smile at everyone.Your life will change and become full of love.  , Look for friends with people of your own gender first. Then consider finding friendships with people of the opposite gender, without having romantic pressure. Let what may be come of its own accord. In time, romance may blossom with someone you've reached out to.   Women may feel that this stage of life turns into a competition for the best guy out there. However, realize that you're all feeling vulnerable and there can be strength in joining together and supporting one another. Just soften a tiny bit and open up to other women who are feeling just as vulnerable as you are; they just have a weird way of showing it.  , This way, you will meet people with similar interests, from all walks of life. When you share an interest with others, age does not matter, so you have the chance to make friends across age groups and to learn from each other.  , It can be depressing and bad for the soul if you feel rejected on it often. In your age group, there is also a risk of coming across people who are misfits and worst of all, married! If you want to find people through this means, be very selective and use your decades of experience to root out the suspicious ones. When actually dating, sum up the date quickly, so that you don't over-invest yourself in somebody who is just going to suck you dry or be a complete loss. That said, it is possible to find someone you really connect with through online dating, so don't dismiss it; it has become the norm for many people now.  , Donate every piece of clothing that does not make you feel attractive and stylish. Buy fashion magazines, watch what people are wearing and make it a plan to be ""on the cutting edge"". Don't go over the top - watch it. But dress appropriately for your figure and add lots of color - scarves, shoes, accessories, ties, etc. Have fun and stay stylish.  , Get a massage, shop for organic fruit and vegetables. Check out vitamins. Buy personal grooming products that are also organic and not full of chemicals.  , Your health is paramount from this point onward. Don't be intimidated by your doctor. If something is bothering you, don't give up. There are lots of doctors out there. Find a good one.  , Take up dancing, join a walking group or buy yourself a bicycle and join a bike club. There is a club for every activity you can think of. Do some research and go for it. You can decide to be miserable or you can decide to move ahead.  , Do research online and pick a cause. Meet real people doing real things to help this planet.  , It's a gold mine. Get to know the staff and invite them to help you find books and resources. You won't believe how much fun the library can be. Plus, there are lots of potential friends at the library.  , Read the newspaper every now and then and watch a bit of the news every day. Not too much. It can be a little depressing. However, it helps to stay informed and aware of what is going on.  , If you live in or near a city, explore it. You could take a walking, cycling or Segway tour of areas of the city. Learn its history in depth.  , Attend more theater, orchestras, cinema, shows and talks. Even movies by yourself can be fun.  , Go and see new places. There is nothing quite like travel to rejuvenate tired outlooks on life. You will return reinvigorated and ready to try new things. Plus, you may make many new friends and some of them might come and visit you.   Visit relatives, long lost friends and other people when you travel. Catch up with people you haven't seen in ages. The way their lives have turned out might give you much perspective.  , If you don't already have a pet, consider getting one. When you're alone, the companionship is invaluable. Plus, many pets need a lot of interaction to ensure their happiness, which feeds your happiness too.   Dogs need exercise daily. Walking your dog twice a day for 30 minutes will get both of you out of the house and can improve your fitness. You may even meet new people!  , Do a night course or a whole degree, whatever you feel would extend your knowledge and give you a new outlook on life. Maybe you would even like to change your career; this could be a way to meet both your need for change and for finding new sources of friendships.

You can write a letter to your friend expressing all of your feelings (you don’t have to send it to them), or you can create a ritual to symbolize the end of the friendship. To be happy, you will need to acknowledge the your feelings, process them, and move on to the next stage of your life.In your letter, you might write about how the friendship started off great, but then went downhill. Include the details of what ended the friendship, how it made you feel, and be sure to clearly state that it is over. For a ritual to symbolize the end of your friendship, you might consider taking an item that your friend gave you and burying it, burning it, or simply throwing it away. Make sure that whatever you do resonates with you as closing the door to this friendship.; , Start with small changes like eating well. Try to avoid venting your anger too much or too often. Do things that you enjoy doing, and allow yourself to do thoughtful things for someone else. This can be daunting, but you have to push through because happiness is largely in your control.Go watch movies that you like, eat at your favorite restaurants, and try new things to see what makes you happiest.  , There are many reasons that you might end your friendship, but it is possible that your ex best friend will want to rekindle it later on. If you are caught off guard, you might regret the decision you make. Think about what you will say to your ex best friend if they ever mention being friends again.You might even practice saying something like “I am flattered that you want to be my friend again, but I think it’s best we don’t go there,” in front of the mirror.  , You will probably be hurt by what your friend says about you, even if they stick to the truth. The key to dealing with this kind of drama, though, is to ignore it. If you decide to “set the record straight” you will be playing into a vicious friend feud that can go on for a long time. Not only does this jeopardize your other friendships, but it also keeps you from moving on.For example, if your former friend is spreading rumors about you at school, you should ignore the rumors rather than spread bad things about your friend in retaliation.  , Nobody wants to pick sides. It isn’t fair to ask your mutual friends to do so. Avoid gossiping about your ex best friend, especially with mutual friends. You should also refrain from sending any messages back and forth between mutual friends.Never say things to your friends like “Next time you see them, tell them I said that they are a liar!”  , Avoid talking to your former friend. Distance yourself from the things that you used to do together, and change any routines that heavily involved your former friend. There will be instances where you and your former friend have to co-exist, but limit contact with them as much as possible.  , Most nasty comments or rude gestures are done to get a reaction out of you. If you don’t give them a reaction, your ex friend will leave you alone much faster. Stay positive by realizing that what your ex best friend says about you doesn’t actually define you. You should also allow yourself to feel good for ignoring the immaturity and letting the situation go.If your ex best friend leaves a nasty note on your car, don’t retaliate. Just throw the note away and go on about your day. Try not to be upset.  , You are likely to run into your ex best friend again sometime. When this happens, you need to be calm and collected. If you can avoid talking altogether, that’s great. If not, say hello, and be polite.If you see your old friend at a party and they ask how you have been, you can respond with something like “I’ve been doing well. I hope you are well, too.” If you run into your former friend at a school event, just acknowledge them and keep going on your way.  , Being polite does not mean that you have to entertain your ex best friend for a long period of time. Answer any questions briefly, if you are comfortable answering them at all. Avoid asking questions; they only invite more conversation.If your ex best friend sees you at the grocery store and starts asking how your mom is doing, you can reply politely, but do not ask about her family. If you want to wish them well, say something like “My mother is doing well. I hope your parents are well, also. Tell them I said “Hello,” please.”  , If you have no interest in rekindling your friendship, do not be too accommodating. Be polite in the moment, and leave that moment with closure. If you make it appear as though you miss your ex best friend that opens to the door to starting the friendship and/or fight back up.There is no need to say things like “It’s great to see you,” or “See you again soon.” Entertain the polite conversation for a short time, and say something like “I’m glad you are doing well, but if you’ll excuse me I need to go talk to my date (or any other person you can think of).

The female fly has a sense of smell for this gas and are attracted to it. This gas also gives off the stinky, musty smell we associate with rotten food or a rotten houseplant that has been over watered. To eliminate the risk of maggots you must eliminate the sources of methane gas/rot., Female flies smell the rotting meat scraps in the garbage can and will flock to it.  Make note of your community garbage truck day of the week. Try to dump your meat scraps the night or day before to limit the time the flies will smell it. If you can't use this timing, place all your meat scraps into a zip lock bag and freeze them until that day.  , The bones and fat can be placed in a pot of water and boiled overnight and seasoned. This is also less expensive and more flavorful than prepared box broth in the store. The boiled bones and meat will have less meat smell thus attracting fewer flies.   Give your leftover meat bones to your dog for crunching. Dogs like to chew on things and meat bones are their favorites. Just make sure the bones however are not too sharp to cut the animals throat. You can also give dogs the gristle and boiled and cooked meat scraps as a treat. Although you should talk to a vet before doing this.  , Maggots don't need much meat or meat juice food to develop into more flies so cleaning up all meat juice and meat smells will starve them and prevent them for turning your trash can into a buffet. Use the same techniques when discarding tools and equipment used to cut meat.   Also clean the rags used in cleaning up the meat juice and newspaper clippings used in preparation (keeping the fish scales neater instead of all over the place) with scalding hot water or in a tightly sealed bag or container before tossing out.  , Not only is a smelly trash can a maggot magnet but a disgusting thing to smell for you and those who live in or visit your house. Rinse your trash can even if it's every 2 or 3 months with plain water during the warm seasons to keep the maggots away and the trash can smelling decent.  , Place such trash in sealed containers. Kitty litter, feminine products, leftover pet food,dirty diapers need to have their bags tightly closed so the stable fly can't smell the methane gas and want to lay eggs in the trash can. Same goes for manure and animal bedding including hay and straw. Don't put dead animals in the household trash either.  Don't put rotting plant matter in the same can as the household trash. If you do you'll have triple trouble with stable flies, blow flies and houseflies. Put it in a separate landscape bag or in a sealed container before tossing it out into the trash can.  , Cold weather doesn't bring maggots but hot weather does. Don't worry about maggots if it's freezing outside because there aren't any flies to lie the eggs that hatch into maggots. If you live in warmer climates you'll have to be extra vigilant in controlling maggots.

Being a part of the selection team, you must know what the hiring goals are or what is the purpose of hiring?   Recruiters mostly ask irrelevant questions during an interview just because of lack of information. They are themselves not clear about their job. In other words, they do not really know what they should ask to judge candidate skills.       This is why it's so important to set hiring goals before starting the interview process Create a one page document that mentions the things you are looking for in the candidate or the things you won’t compromise upon while making a hiring decision. For instance, your hiring goal can be to find a marketing manager, aged above 40 having extraordinary communication skills and past experience of serving in a medium or large organization.; , Another common reason recruiters ask bad interview questions that are totally irrelevant to the job is their lack of knowledge regarding the job posts being filled.   There is no logic checking leadership skills while hiring a sales worker or checking communication skills while hiring an I.T. expert. You should know the job duties for the relevant post so that you may ask questions accordingly. It is recommended that you read the job description before taking the interview. Create a one page document mentioning the key job responsibilities, then ask questions on the basis of job duties instead of asking random questions  , It is better to create a checklist of all the questions to be asked beforehand in order to avoid asking bad interview questions. If you are new in the recruitment team then this tip is especially for you.   Creating a checklist does not mean that you have to strictly follow it. You may also ask any other question that comes in your mind at the time of taking the interview. The purpose of creating checklist is just to remain focused. Read the job description and check hiring goals while making checklist, or get a checklist made from an experienced recruiter. Double check the questions to ask to make sure that all of them are relevant to the job.  , It is very important for recruiters to put aside their personal preferences and biases when giving interviews.   Asking confusing, irrelevant and difficult questions from candidate just because he or she is a certain rare, religion or gender is neither logical nor ethical. Don’t let your personal feelings affect the interview process and educate yourself about possible biases you have to avoid. Set the same standards for everyone irrespective of their age, gender, race, ethnicity etc.  , Many recruitment teams interview hundreds of people in one day from early morning till evening. This is not a good practice as it may affect the hiring decision.   Recruiters are so tired sometimes that they start asking strange questions that are in no way relevant to the job post. You must stop the interview process after you get tired in order to avoid this issue. Take a short break after conducting every few interviews in order to regain your energy and grab a coffee to stay fresh.  , There are a few questions you must ask yourself about every single question on your list. You will automatically avoid asking bad interview questions after giving answers to following questions:   Does this question provide me with useful and relevant information about the candidate? Does this question help me in judging the skills and abilities of the candidate? Is this question worth asking? Is this question relevant to the job? Is this question logical and practical? Is it necessary to ask this question necessary for taking Is this question ethical and professional?  , Some good interview questions include:   Tell me about any work experience relevant to this current job. Why did you leave your last job? Can you work under pressure? Why do you think you are a perfect fit for this job? Give three reasons why we should we hire you?  , You should never ask questions such as the following:   Briefly tell me about your family. What is your current body weight? Do you plan to start a family? Have you ever been arrested? Have you ever taken any drugs?

"['correct muscle imbalances with single-leg squats', 'try squat box jumps', 'keep your core engaged with bulgarian split squats', 'tone your leg muscles with a plié squat', 'improve your balance with pistol squats', 'balance and stretch with figure-four squats']",How to Do Sumo Squat Jumps2," Most people have a dominant leg, and it typically gets more work than your non-dominant leg. Doing single-leg squats starting with your non-dominant leg can help even your legs out.Muscle imbalances can lead to injury over time if not corrected. When doing single-leg squats, you can lean against a wall if you have difficulty balancing.  , Squat box jumps can be dangerous if not done with proper form. Make sure you use a relatively low box, and practice to get your form down correctly before you add this exercise to your regular routine.To do squat box jumps, lower into a regular squat. Instead of standing, jump onto the box from the squat position. Focus on maintaining your squat position throughout the jump. Step back to start and repeat. Make sure both feet are landing squarely on the box, otherwise you might end up banging your shins on the edge.  , If you have a step or a stool, Bulgarian split squats provide a good lower body exercise that also engages your core to stabilize your body.Set the stool behind you so that you can rest the toes of one foot on it from a standing position with your knees slightly bent. Place your hands behind your head, elbows extended out to the sides. Lower yourself into a squat, allowing your back leg to bend. Make sure the knee of your front leg stays over your ankle and your shin is perpendicular to the floor. Raise back up. Do 10 to 15 repetitions, then switch sides.  , If you've ever admired the lean legs of a ballet dancer, you might enjoy the plié squat, which borrows a position from ballet to help tone your hips and thighs.Stand in a wide stance with your toes turned out, and place your hands on your hips. Bend your knees out over your toes, lowering your body into a squat. When your thighs are parallel to the floor, raise your heels so that you're standing on your toes. Raise and lower your heels 10 times. Return to a standing position to complete one repetition. Do five repetitions of this exercise.  , The pistol squat is an extremely difficult squat variation, but if you're relatively fit and looking for a challenge, the pistol squat could be an effective full-body exercise for you.From standing, extend your left leg out in front of you with your knee straight. Reach your arms out straight over your left leg to help you balance. Lower into a deep squat with your right leg, going as low as you can without your left leg touching the floor. Press back up to stand to complete one repetition. Try to work up to 10 repetitions on each leg. Make sure you do the same number of repetitions on each leg to prevent muscle imbalances.  , The figure-four squat gives your hips a good stretch as well as helping you improve your balance when standing on one leg. If the balance is too difficult, you can lean against a wall.Squat down slightly and lift your right leg, bending your knee. Cross your right leg over your left so that your ankle is resting just above your knee. Lower down into a full squat so that your left thigh is parallel with the ground. Hold the squat for a few seconds, then release and do the other side.

"['dress to impress', 'accentuate your natural beauty', 'be confident', 'catch his eye', 'become what he wants', 'touch him', 'find another guy', 'give him time to break up with his girlfriend']",How to Get a Guy Who Has a Girlfriend2," Whenever you're around him, wear your best outfits. Dress in your most flattering clothes and get yourself feeling sexy. He'll begin to see you in a different light.   Wearing your best outfits doesn't mean wearing skimpy tops and short skirts. Your best outfit could be a pair of great fitting jeans, boots, and a t-shirt. It might be leggings, an oversized sweater, and a scarf. It might be a cute sundress and sandals. Not only do you want to look your best to impress him, but you also want to feel your best.  , Don't try to go over the top to attract the guy. You don't want to wear too much make up or dress like you're going to a formal event or a club. Use your natural beauty to attract him. Subtle will work better than being obvious.   Get a haircut or try a new hairstyle. Start wearing makeup. Get a facial, paint your nails, get a pedicure, or get your eyebrows waxed. He won't know that you've gotten your hair cut or started wearing a different shade of lip gloss, but he will notice that something is different and pleasing. This helps catch his attention, even if he's not sure what exactly has changed., This is one of the most important tips for attracting a guy. Sexiness isn't necessarily how you dress or how pretty you may or may not be. Confidence is sexy and attractive. Whenever you're around him, dress in clothes that make you feel great, and then project confidence. This confidence will read as sexiness. That is more helpful than the tightest outfit or perfect hair.It is especially important to be confident when you are around him and his girlfriend. Don't let the fact that he's not with you destroy your confidence. Instead, hold your head up high and show him what he's missing. If the girlfriend sees him staring at you, it might cause some problems with them that would work to your benefit. Don't be someone who is just there, pining after him, and waiting around for him. You are an awesome person with a full life, friends, family, interests, and other activities. Being yourself is sexy and confident, and remembering that you and your life is fabulous helps you be desirable., One of the ways to let on that there is some attraction is to let him catch you staring at him. Don't be overt or creepy; be coy. Smile shyly at him before glancing away quickly. This helps him notice you. You want him to start thinking about you.   After a few days of doing this, stop. You want to keep playing coy and be hard to get. Make him miss your stares and your smiles.Find reasons to walk by his desk. Think of a reason to call him. Do these things sparingly. You want to make him interested and then pull back. Don't make yourself too available to him. You want to tease him and then make him want to see you more.  , If you're friends with the guy, find out what he likes in a girl. More importantly, find out what he doesn't like in girls, especially in his girlfriend. Whatever quality he mentions he resents in her, become the opposite. You want to attract him by sharing interests and representing the things that he wants in a woman.   Does he think she shops too much? Tell him you hate shopping. Is he upset she doesn't like him watching football? Ask him to come to a game with you. Does he think she's too uptight? Engage in childlike pranks with him. Don't change yourself too much because he should always like you for who you are. If he is going to leave his girlfriend for you, he should be leaving her for a good reason rather than for a false personality.  , Find ways to touch him in subtle, light ways. Don't throw yourself all over him; keep it coy and fun. Be flirty. The touches should be simple and not cross any personal boundaries.   When he says something funny, gently touch his arm or leg as you laugh. Touch his shoulder or back when you greet him.Try putting him into the protective role when you touch him. Use him to hold on to as you adjust the strap of your shoe., Don't ignore other guys as you work up to getting your man. Dating other guys shows the guy you're interested in that you are attractive and desirable to other people. As he is beginning to see you in a new way, this will make him jealous.   Make sure he knows that you are dating this new guy. Mention the new guy when you are around him. Bring the guy to group outings so he can see the two of you together. Don't go overboard with the displays of affection. Make sure you act interested in the guy you are dating, but don't be overly sexual or affectionate. You want to make him jealous, not turn him off or push him away. Dating other guys also gives you the opportunity to meet new guys. One of these guys might be better than the guy you're trying to win - and the best part? He's single and already into you.  , Give the guy space to figure out his feelings, clear his head, and make important decisions. Breaking up with his girlfriend is a huge decision for him. Don't rush him, don't crowd him, and let it happen as he needs it to. If he does have feelings for you, give him time to break it off with her. If you rush or crowd him, it could sabotage everything for you.Don't give in until he's broken things off with his girlfriend. If he keeps telling you he'll do it soon but never does, you're getting played.  ","['natural beauty', 'time', 'girlfriend', 'eye', 'guy']"

Call your insurance agency to make sure.   If you allow additional drivers who are NOT on your personal auto policy, you run the risk that if those persons are operating the rental, they, and the damages they cause, will not be covered. Ask your insurance company about this. If your policy provides minimum coverage, you may need to compute the value of the loss or damage of a newer vehicle (the rental car) and decide if you need to supplement your coverage. Personal auto policies that extend collision coverage to a rental car may only provide a coverage limit equal to the value of your own vehicle. If the value of your personal vehicle is less than that of the rental vehicle, you could still incur some damage responsibility.; , Some credit card companies offer rental car insurance coverage if you use their card to pay for the rental.   Ask about the requirements for getting reimbursed. For example, you may not be reimbursed if you don't notify the credit card company within a certain period of time (e.g. 45 days) after the incident.Typically, for credit card insurance to work, the rental car has to be paid in full with that credit card, and you must decline the rental company's collision waiver, and be the primary renter of the car (although additional authorized drivers are also covered)., Long-term rentals - Coverage may be limited.Most credit card company plans cover vehicles rented for up to one month.In a foreign country - Coverage may not apply.Certain rental vehicles - Some rental vehicles aren't covered (exotic cars, camper, pickup trucks, etc.), Hindsight is 20/20, and it is always better to pay a nominal amount per day rather than having to pay thousands of dollars over years in a payment plan for property damage, or having liens placed against you for bodily injury damage. There are a few plans that most states are required by law to offer:   Collision damage waiver (CDW), also known as ""optional vehicle protection"" or ""loss damage waiver"" (LDW). Loss damage waiver means that if the car is damaged for any reason, you can just walk away without any liability. This is true even if your own personal auto policy carries over. This gets you out of paying the deductible that you would normally have to pay under your own car insurance policy, unless the waiver itself has a deductible.  costs up to $19/day shifts liability for collision damage from you to the car rental company covers for ""loss of use"". Loss of use is a fee that is charged by the rental company if your rental car is damaged and is sent out for repair. You would be billed a loss-of-use fee for all damages and repair to the rental car as well as a fee for every day that the vehicle was not able to be rented. That can add up! A loss-of-use fee is not normally covered by personal auto insurance policies. can be voided if you were driving illegally or on unpaved roads If you don't have collision and comprehensive insurance of your own, it's generally a good idea to buy a waiver. There are different levels, dictating how much your responsible for (none of the damage, damage in excess of $500 or $3000, etc.).Liability insurance  protects for up to $1 million costs between $7 and $14 a day if you already have an insurance policy, you already have this Most states require rental companies to cover a minimum liability at no cost to you. Check to see what those requirements are in your state, and decide if that is sufficient for you.Personal accident insurance  covers medical and ambulance bills for anyone in the car costs $1-5 a day you probably don't need this if you have an existing car insurance policy, or if you (and everyone else in the car) has adequate health insurance coverage   Personal effects coverage  covers theft of items in vehicle costs $1-4 a day an alternative is to buy a floating policy under home or renters insurance so valuable items are fully protected wherever you go    ","['people', 'limitations', 'options', 'insurance policy', 'business trips.most insurance companies', 'automobile use', 'personal auto policies', 'food', 'insurance', 'specific conditions', 'kind', 'rental agency', 'delivery', 'protection', 'business trip', 'business purposes', 'rentals', 'credit card company', 'car insurance']"
"['chat with your staff', 'write a thank-you note', 'buy small tokens of appreciation', 'take your employee to lunch', 'tell your employees when you hear them complimented', 'use small rewards to build momentum']",How to Recognize Your Employees1," Something as simple as stopping by to talk to employees will make them feel recognized. Stop by on a Friday afternoon so that employees can feel validated before heading off to the weekend.You don’t have to say much. Ask them how their week went and what their plans are during the weekend. Be prepared to share your own plans. Some employees are uncomfortable talking to the boss, so note if they don’t have much to say. You can recognize them in other ways.; , Almost 75% of people save handwritten thank-you notes.You don’t have to say much. Remember not to give a generic thank-you, but identify the accomplishment and explain its significance.For example, you can write something like, “Jaxon, thanks for working late all last week. We’ve closed the quarter with the most sales ever, thanks to you.” You have to be sincere.Accordingly, you shouldn’t write a thank-you note unless you really have a reason to thank them. Write out thank-you notes ahead of time. For example, write “Kevin, I want to thank you for” and then leave the rest blank. When you think of something, you can fill in the rest of the sentence. By writing notes like this ahead of time, you’ll be on the lookout for excellent performance to reward.  , The gift doesn’t need to be large. In fact, it should be proportional to the accomplishment you are rewarding. If someone stayed late on Friday afternoon, you can give them a small gift costing no more than $10. However, someone who increased your department’s sales by 50% should be given a much larger reward, in addition to a bonus.   Try to find out what your employee likes ahead of time. Generic gifts are okay, but it’s better to give them something you know they’ll appreciate.For example, where do they get coffee in the morning? You can get them a $20 gift card to the coffee shop.  , If you don’t know what to give someone for a gift, then take them out to lunch and pick up the tab.This is a great gift because you can get to know your employee by asking them questions about their life.   Be honest with yourself. If you aren’t that interested in talking to your employees, then don’t take them to lunch, which could be awkward. Your employee will pick up on the vibe that you aren’t really interested in talking to them. However, to facilitate conversation, you can have them choose a coworker to come along.  , You might be at a meeting with other department heads when one of them praises a member of your team. Be sure to relay this compliment to your employee.All you need to do is drop by someone’s desk and say, “I just spoke to Carl in Accounting. He said you helped him reconcile some numbers last Thursday. He couldn’t stop praising how helpful you were.” You can also create a recognition bulletin board. Print out emails from people complimenting your team members and post the email to the board.  , You can be strategic with the rewards you give. For example, a mediocre employee might need a lot of reinforcement right out of the gate. Remember to celebrate small accomplishments, such as someone’s first sale or their first week on the job.Of course, an employee eventually needs to do excellent work without the positive reinforcements. But it can’t hurt to reward people early, so that you can reinforce positive work habits.

However, your job in this situation is to stay cool and collected. While you may have the urge to yell right back at them, fight the urge! Yelling and getting angry will only escalate the situation. Instead, put on your best customer service attitude and buckle down--it’s time to get to work.Never use sarcasm or obviously faked politeness. Behaving in such a way will only fuel the customer’s rage and will make the situation a whole lot worse.; , An angry customer generally just wants someone to vent their anger to and today, you are that person. That means that you need to do your best to listen carefully to what they are saying. Give the customer your undivided attention--do not look around, space out or let other things distract you. Look at the speaker and really listen to what they are saying.When you listen to them, listen for the answers to these questions: What happened to make them upset? What do they want? What can you do to help?  , If the customer is particularly angry, he or she may say something (or several things) that are really rude. Keep in mind that you should not take it personally--he or she is upset with the business, the product, or the service they have been provided with--they are not upset with you as a person. You will have to set your personal feelings aside.   Keep in mind though, that if the customer becomes too abusive, or seems really threatening, you should tell them that you will go get your supervisor or someone else to help you resolve this problem. When you are walking back to the customer, fill your supervisor or helper in on the situation and explain why you felt you needed to come get them (ie. you felt really threatened, etc.) If worse comes to worse, you will have to ask the customer to leave. Know your organizations policy on when to call the authorities and how to document any encounter like this where noting specific details might be necessary for follow up.   , Once the customer is done venting, make sure you know exactly what it is they are upset about. If you are still feeling a little unclear, repeat what you think the customer is upset about, or ask him questions. Repeating the problem back to the customer will show him that you were listening, and will also let you confirm the problem that needs to be fixed.A good way to make sure that you know exactly what the problem is, is to use calm and collected wording like “I understand that you are upset, and rightly so, that the pizza was delivered an hour late to your house.”  , Showing empathy will help make the customer understand that you really are trying to help them. Once you have confirmed what the problem is, show them that you feel really bad about it, and completely understand why they are upset. Say something like:   “I completely understand your frustration--waiting for a pizza, especially when you’re really hungry, is a horrible feeling.” “You are right to be annoyed--delivery delays can throw off all whole night of plans.”  , Let the customer know that you are genuinely sorry that this happened to them--regardless of whether or not you think they are being a bit dramatic about the situation. Along with empathizing, apologizing can go a long way. Sometimes upset customers just want to have someone apologize to them for the bad service. Hopefully the customer will cool down a bit once you apologize on behalf of the company.Say something like, “I am so sorry your pizza was not delivered on time. It’s incredibly frustrating when that happens and I completely understand why you are annoyed. Let’s see what we can do to make this right.”  , If you are in the process of handling a situation and the customer demands that you call your manager or supervisor over, it is best to follow the wishes of the customer. However, if you can avoid having to get your manager involved, do it. Handling a situation on your own will show your supervisor that you have the wherewithal to deal with angry customers in a calm and collected manner.  , Now that you have heard what the customer is upset about, you should come up with a solution to provide them with. If you feel like you know a solution that will make your customer happy, then present it to her.For instance, in the situation with the late pizza, you might present something like, “I totally understand that you are upset your pizza was delivered late. I would like to refund your order and offer you a voucher for a free pizza. I will personally make sure that your next pizza gets delivered to you with the utmost haste.”  , If you are not completely sure what would make your customer happy, then simply ask her. What would she like to have be done about the problem? Is there an outcome that would make her satisfied? Say something like:   “What would you like to have happen? If it is within my power, I will see that it gets done.”  , Tell your customer what you will do next to ensure that the problem is resolved. Give her your contact information, particularly if you are speaking with her over the phone, so that she can contact you if the problem arises again.  , Once your customer has left or you have hung up with her, take a few minutes to process what just happened and allow yourself to calm down. Even if the customer left happily, these sort of situations can be really stressful. Take a few moments to destress and clear your mind. Documenting what happened is recommended- date, time, place, the events, and how it was resolved.  , Give your customer a call once the problem has been resolved. Ask him if everything is going smoothly. When you can, go the extra mile by sending a handwritten apology or by giving him a discount on his next purchase.","['customer', 'feelings', 'action', 'feedback', 'mindset', 'concerns', 'situation', 'several minutes', 'manager', 'ordeal', 'solutions', 'possible solution']"

The eye doctor will assess your eyes, making sure that you do not have any diseases of the eye or eye conditions that could impact the surgery.Before picking an eye doctor, do some research, either online or among people you know, on ophthalmologists that do laser surgery in your area. You want a doctor that is well respected and known for reliable work. Don't pick the cheapest ophthalmologist just to save a few dollars, however, make sure that you are not paying an excessive amount to get a thorough and professional surgery.; , You will need to discuss the ophthalmologist's findings to find out if you have any eye conditions that will prevent you from having your vision corrected with surgery. Conditions that could impact your ability to have laser vision surgery include thin corneas, glaucoma, herpes of the eye, large corneas, or inflammation of the eyelids. If your doctor says that you can't have the surgery, it means that they do not feel confident that they can complete the surgery successfully. For example, if you have thin corneas, the doctor may say they cannot do the surgery because they need the cornea to be thick enough to withstand the laser reshaping done in laser eye surgery. In this case, if your cornea is too thin and the doctor tries to reshape it, it could result in blindness. Having one or more of these conditions doesn't automatically mean that you can't have the procedure, but it may mean that one type of procedure may be better than another. If your vision prescription has changed in the last year, you shouldn't get the procedure done. This means that no one under 18 should get this surgery, as younger people's vision is likely to continue changing. Tell your doctor if you have had any eye diseases or procedures in the past. This could impact their assessment.  , In order to get laser surgery you will need to be in good general health. This includes having no eye problems or eye injuries that you are currently recovering from.You should also avoid getting laser eye surgery if you’re pregnant or nursing. If you are taking medications that could impact your healing, such as retinoic acid and steroids, then you should wait to have the surgery.  , Even if the surgery can be performed on your eyes, that doesn't mean that now is the right time for it. For example, you may have commitments or job requirements that could be negatively impacted by side effects from surgery. Think about your life and lifestyle and how this surgery could impact them.In general, the recovery time for laser eye surgery is very quick. You should be able to see clearly almost immediately, as long as things go as expected. However, if there are any complications, it could impact your ability to see clearly, which means that could impact your ability to work for a few days.  , In order to assess whether you should get surgery, you need to be aware of the risks associated with the procedure. While laser vision surgery does not require anesthesia, and thus the risks are lower than some other surgeries, there are some risks.Possible side effects and risks include double vision, blurriness, glare, astigmatism, dry eyes, over correction, and under correction. Above all, any surgery to the eye does have the risk of causing blindness.  , Laser vision surgery is usually not covered by insurance, so you will have to pay for the procedure out of pocket. While the cost varies, it can cost between $1,000 to $3,000 per eye.Many eye surgery centers have payment plans available, so discuss payment options with your surgery center.  , After you have your eye exam, your doctor should tell you about your options for surgery. They will tell you what type of surgery will work best for you given the state of your eyes.   If your doctor gives you several options for surgical procedures, then you will need to do some research and decide between them.  , LASIK surgery is the most common laser vision surgery. During LASIK, a laser is used to resurface the outside of the cornea, removing any imperfections in the surface.In order to get LASIK you need a thick cornea. If your cornea is too thin, you should not have the procedure. LASIK is an outpatient procedure that requires very little recovery time.  , LASEK surgery is similar to LASIK, except that it can be done on patients that have corneas that are too thin for LASIK because it does not require the same flap to be opened on the eye's surface. If your doctor suggests it, that probably means that your corneas are too thin for LASIK.Because LASEK destroys less cornea tissue than LASIK, it also is less likely to cause dry eyes afterward.  , PRK is another procedure that uses lasers to reshape the cornea. It was developed before LASIK and has been largely replaced by that process. However, PRK is still sometimes used for specific eye structures.Unlike with LASIK and LASEK, while recovering from PRK you will need to wear an eye patch over your eye., Vision Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) and Verisyse Phakic Intraocular Lens (P-IOL) are two types of laser surgery that can be used to correct your vision if you have cataracts in addition to vision problems.The procedure begins with an opening being made in the cornea and then a lens being placed between the cornea and the iris.   Only those with cataracts or risk factors for cataracts are usually given this type of surgery.  , Your doctor will give you specific directions about what to do before and after surgery. Follow these directions closely so that your experience is as easy as possible and so that the surgery goes well.Your doctor is likely to tell you to keep contacts out of your eyes for a week to three weeks before surgery, depending on the type of lens' you wear. They will also want you to make sure that you arrange a ride home after surgery, that you take all of your normal medications before surgery, and that you arrive on time with no makeup or perfume on. After surgery you will want to avoid rubbing or touching your eyes for a week, use eye drops as directed, and avoid using makeup or lotion near your eyes for several days., While the results of laser eye surgery may be almost immediate, it is not unusual to have moments of blurriness for a few days after the surgery. However, even if you have moments of blurriness, your vision should be dramatically improved by the surgery.If you are having pain that is not controlled by the pain medication that you were prescribed after surgery, then call your doctor. This level of pain is not normal and needs to be addressed.  , You should schedule and go to a follow-up appointment after laser eye surgery. At this appointment, your doctor will look at your eyes and make sure that the surgery went as planned. They will also assure that the healing has gone well.  You should go to a follow-up visit within 24 to 48 hours of surgery.","['vision', 'surgery', 'doctor', 'prk vision surgery', 'follow-up appointment', 'surgery options', 'lasik vision surgery', 'good candidate', 'risks', 'lens implantation', 'blurry vision', 'lasek surgery', 'post-surgery instructions', 'ophthalmologist']"

Purification of the body and clothes before prayer is called taharah.; , Usually water is required to cleanse one’s body before performing salah. This kind of washing ritual is called wudu, which requires that you clean your hands, forearms, face, head, and feet.There is a more intense cleansing called ghusl that is required after instances of “uncleanliness” (such as sexual intercourse, menstruation, and child birth). Ghusl involves bathing the entire body.Wudu is nullified after any natural discharge (urine, gas, stool, ejaculation), after falling asleep, or after any type of unconsciousness. If one of these things has happened to you, you must perform wudu again before you engage in salah., Tayammum is permitted in the following instances:   When acceptable water is not available within a one mile radius. When there is a legitimate fear that an enemy or a dangerous animal is near the water. When using your water for wudu would risk not having enough water to drink later. When there is no means of getting water out of the well (no rope or bucket to draw the water). When using water would be dangerous to your health. When you don’t have enough money to purchase water that is being sold. When water is being sold at an unreasonable price. When there is no trace of water and no person to ask about where to find water.  , If you cannot find enough water to perform wudu, or if using the water you have would endanger your health or that of your dependents, it is appropriate to perform tayammum instead of wudu.Permitted types of water include fresh water from a pond or well, melted snow, well water, or river/sea/spring water.Prohibited kinds of water include unclean water, water whose color has changed, water into which something impure has fallen, water extracted from fruit and trees, water left over after animals have been drinking it, or water previously used in wudu or ghusl., When you find yourself in a position where you need to cleanse your body before performing salah, but there is no acceptable water to use, you can perform tayammum with clean earth/dirt instead.   Items on which tayammum is accepted include:  Taahir (pure) earth Sand Stone Limestone Baked earthen pots Walls made of mud, stone, or brick Clay Any item with a thick covering of dust   The first preference is fresh earth, but if none is available you can choose clay, a lump of sand, or even a stone if necessary.Items that are not acceptable to perform tayammum on include:  Wood Metal Glass Food items Anything that burns to ash or melts    , This location can be anything natural like a rock, sand, or grass. The location must be clean to maintain the purity of the ritual.   If the location of tayammum is impure, you must purify it with water. If there is no water to purify the location, you can use any of the items that are permitted to use for tayammum (listed above).  , To perform tayammum, you must clean your body and clothing thoroughly (this is called tahir). This means that you should remove any unnecessary coverings like rings or nail polish., If you put on your socks or shoes while you have a valid wudu, it is unnecessary to take them off and wash your feet every time you must renew your wudu. You may leave your shoes/socks on and simply wipe the top of each covered foot one time with your wet hands instead of washing your entire foot.   If you have no water to wet your hands, you can use any of the items that are permitted for tayammum (listed above) to wipe the top of each of your covered feet. You can do this for up to 24 hours. However, if you are traveling, this method will work for three days., All parts of tayammum must be performed in the correct order, so it is important that you know the order of the steps so that you can follow them accurately.If you make a mistake in the order, you must begin your tayammum from the beginning again.  , This fact emphasizes the importance of beginning your tayammum in the name of Allah., This is the way that you announce your intention to perform tayammum. You do this by saying “I am doing tayammum in place of wudu, for the pleasure of Allah and to seek closeness to him.It is important to announce your intention for tayammum so that the entirety of the sacred ritual is maintained and respected.  , This is the part where the clean earth is necessary. Strike your palms simultaneously on the earth (or clay, sand, or stone, according to preference and availability).It is not necessary to cover your hands completely with the earth – just touch it with your palms.  , The face encompasses the right ear to the left ear. Place your palms on your forehead at the hairline and pull your hands down until they reach the bridge of your nose. Only use your palms during this process., Move the palm of your left hand so that it covers the entire back of your right hand from the wrist bone to the fingertips. Then repeat this action with the right palm covering your left hand., Once more, strike your hands simultaneously on the ground so that they come into contact with the clean earth., Cover each hand again (beginning with the left and moving on to the right) to conclude the tayammum ritual.","['hands', 'water', 'hand', 'ground', 'clean place', 'first chapter', 'following', 'first verse', 'name', 'acceptable water', 'phrase', 'qur', 'feet', 'face', 'niyyah', 'process', 'ablution', 'order', 'tayammum', 'bismillaah hirahmaan nirrahiim', 'allah', 'unnecessary items', 'practice cleanliness']"

Checking accounts allow you to access your funds easily and use checks and debit cards instead of cash.; , Regular checking accounts pay no interest at all; they are meant only to fund your checks and debit-card expenditures. Interest-bearing checking accounts do offer some interest on your deposits. There are two basic kinds of interest-bearing checking accounts:   Regular interest-bearing checking accounts pay a minimal interest rate. If you leave funds in such an account for very long, you are likely to lose considerable purchasing power – this money would usually yield more interest in a savings, money market, or certificate of deposit account. High-interest checking accounts pay a little more. They provide an above-average interest income for your money. However, this increase in interest may be offset by fees, and you typically have to keep a much higher balance to qualify.  , You can add cash and checks to your account at any time without restriction. Simply fill out a deposit slip and deposit the funds into a designated ATM or in person at the bank.   Note that if you deposit checks into your account, your bank may hold the funds (or part of the funds) until the checks clear. Check with your bank to be sure.  , Since the ability to write checks is a key component of having a checking account, it’s important to know how to fill them out correctly. All checks have designated spaces for the following information:   Date. This is self explanatory: fill in the current date. Pay to the Order of. On this line, write the name of the check’s recipient – it can be a person or a company. $ Amount. Use numerals here. Write the number on the left most part of the field, taking care not to leave any space – these minimizes the risk of people fraudulently writing additional numbers. Dollars. Write the corresponding amount, this time using words. Start at the left side, and write any cents as a fraction – the number of cents over 100. If there is extra space, draw a line straight through to the end of the field. Signature. Sign your name here. Memo. This field is optional. If desired, write a note to indicate what the check is for. If you are paying a bill, this is a good place to include your account number.  , Every month, you will receive a statement, noting in detail each check you wrote, all funds removed or deposited at an ATM or in the bank, all debit card transactions, and any other pertinent changes to your account. The statement will also have your current balance.   Get in the habit of looking over your monthly statements carefully and comparing them to your own records. Errors sometimes occur. Checking account statements are often available by email instead of on paper. Check with your bank.  , Savings accounts are the most popular type of bank account. They pay basic interest on your money and allow you to withdraw it at any time. Therefore, a savings account is a good option for storing extra funds.  , There are two basic types of savings accounts: passbook savings and statement accounts.   Passbook accounts give you a bank book, where all deposit transactions are recorded. You can add and withdraw money only at the bank during regular business hours. With the prevalence of ATMs and electronic banking, some banks no longer offer this type of account. Statement accounts are more common. You are issued an ATM card and provided with monthly or quarterly statements. You can withdraw money at any time from an ATM. In some cases, your ATM card functions like a debit card as well, and can therefore be used to pay bills and make purchases. Check with your bank.  , In general, savings accounts yield more interest than checking accounts, but different banks may have different requirements for savings accounts, and they may pay different interest rates. Shop around to find the best place to deposit your money.   Keep in mind the savings accounts typically pay less interest per year than money market or certificate of deposit accounts.  , Check with your bank to see how your interest is calculated. This should enable you to project how much you will earn over a certain period.  , In many ways, money market accounts (MMAs) are identical to savings accounts; they are interest-bearing deposit accounts. They usually pay higher interest rates than savings accounts, but they also require higher balances.   With MMAs, your money will be invested by the bank, but you will receive your interest no matter what. This makes MMAs different from money market funds, which may lose money if the investment does not perform well.  , There are two fundamental types of MMAs: basic MMAs and tiered MMAs.   A basic money market account simply requires a minimum deposit (at some banks, it might be as low as $100) and pays interest based on your balance. A tiered MMA offers higher interest rates for higher balances.  , MMAs usually pay more interest than standard checking and savings accounts, but less than mutual funds or stock investments. On the other hand, they are risk free.  , Certificates of deposit (also called CDs or sometimes Certificate of Time Deposits) are risk-free investments. You deposit a certain amount of money into an account for a specified period of time (usually between 30 days and 5 years). In exchange for committing your money for that period of time, you receive a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account usually provides.  , When the specified period of time ends, your CD “matures.” At this point, you can either withdraw the money or allow it to “roll over” for another equal period of time.   In general, unless you tell your bank that you want to withdraw the money, they will roll the CD over automatically. Check with your bank to see what you need to do to withdraw the funds.  , Certificates of deposit come in three basic forms: liquid CDs, “bump up CDs,” and brokered CDs.   Liquid (or “no penalty”) CDs can be withdrawn at any time with no early withdrawal penalty charges. You can therefore choose to move your money to a higher-paying CD if the opportunity arises. Bump up CDs let you maintain an existing CD but move it to a higher rate if your bank has one to offer. This will not typically happen automatically; you have to request it from the bank. Brokered CDs are CDs found by a broker or financial advisor, who scouts the marketplace for the best CD rates.  , Certificate of deposit rates vary, and a few factors play crucial roles in determining how much interest you can make.   The length of time is key. The longer you agree to keep your money tied up, the higher the interest rate will be. Economic rates play a role. When rates are generally high, so are CD rates. Credit unions often offer slightly higher rates. Because credit unions are non-profit institutions, they typically offer slightly higher rates than banks do. Short-term opportunities sometimes occur. Occasionally, banks will try to win business by offering higher rates on CDs for a short period of time.

This is because lymphosarcoma can affect a variety of organs, so the symptoms can vary quite a bit.However, symptoms to look out for include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss.   A good example of how general the symptoms are is diarrhea, which can signal a variety of illnesses. The vagueness of symptoms is why it's important to pay attention to your cat's general healthy and to get your cat checked by a vet, who can perform a clinical examination and draw up a list of possible causes. Also, the symptoms will vary depending on what type of lymphoma the cat has.When the lymphocytes flood different areas and organs, the results differ greatly. Most affected cats fall into the 10-12 year old age bracket, but others occur outside this range.This means that if your cat is having these general symptoms of illness, and it is also old, the likelihood that the symptoms are caused by lymphosarcoma are greater.; , Enlarged lymph nodes are a symptom of lymphosarcoma. The nodes become swollen and easy to feel. These exist in pairs (one gland on the left and one of the right of the body) in a mirror image of each other.The easiest to feel are the submandibular (in the angle of the jaw) prescapular (in front of the shoulder blades) axillary (in the armpit) inguinal (in the groin) and popliteal (behind the knee). These glands are usually not easy to find and unless you are a trained veterinary professional. They can vary in size from a small quail's eggs to golf ball sized.  , Make sure that it stays relatively steady. Weight loss is one symptom of lymphosarcoma, although it can signal a variety of illnesses. This is because the cat loses its appetite as a result of feeling unwell, not because of the specific disease.Even if your cat has lost its appetite, it may have an increased thirst. Cancer can change levels of certain minerals in the blood stream, which can cause the cat to be thirsty.  , This can arise in any form of lymphosarcoma, but most commonly with lymphoma in the gut. This is due to the fact that the gut has a reduced ability to absorb the nutrition from food.The vomiting and diarrhea associated with lymphosarcoma is the same as vomiting and diarrhea associated with a wide variety of illnesses. Because of this, get your cat looked at by a veterinary professional if it has these symptoms. The cat could have a simple intestinal bug or may be very ill and your veterinarian is the best person to assess this.  , Assess whether your cat is acting normally or whether it is acting strangely. Decreased activity, such as the cat being lethargic, lacking energy, and seeming unwell, can be a symptom of lymphosarcoma.This can also show itself through lack of grooming activity, so the cat's coat becomes dull looking and unkempt.  , Lymphosarcoma can get into the lungs and make it very difficult for a cat to breath.The cat may take rapid shallow breaths. The cat may also change the way it sits or lays if it is having difficulty breathing.   For example, it may not want to curl up but instead rest with its head and neck extended in order to make it easier to breath.  , If you suspect that your cat is ill and you are not sure what it causing it, get the cat looked at by a veterinary professional. Lymphosarcoma has similar symptoms to a wide variety of illnesses, so its best to let your veterinarian know about your cat's symptoms and let the vet sort out a diagnosis.Your veterinarian will give the cat a general examination and assess its general health first. Then he or she will proceed with assessment of the illness.  , After a clinical examination, the vet will decide which are the most appropriate tests to run. If you are concerned about cost, feel free to discuss with the vet the costs of certain tests. A screening blood test is required in order to check on the cat's overall health and the impact the suspected lymphoma is having on organ function. The vet will also want to know if the cat is vaccinated against FeLV or not. The vaccination protects against certain forms of this cancer.   The cat will also be screened for FeLV and FIV. While positive tests increase the chance of lymphoma, a negative test does not rule out lymphoma.The key diagnostic tool is examining cells from the swollen lymph node under a microscope. This can either be done by the vet taking a biopsy, or in some cases when the external lymph nodes are swollen it is possible to reach a diagnosis based on a fine needle aspirate. This is when the vet harvests a sample through a hypodermic needle and sprays the cells onto a microscope slide.When a pathologists looks at those cells under the microscope they can identify the type as lymphocytes and confirm they are present in abnormal numbers. It is also important to work out if other organs are affected, so the vet will probably want to complete a scan of the internal organs included liver, spleen, and kidneys.  , Diagnosis can be difficult with certain forms of lymphosarcoma and you and your veterinarian should discuss this difficulty. The most common form of lymphoma affects the gut, with the bowel wall becoming flooded with lymphocytes. This can be more difficult to diagnose as the thickening is internal and signs of a problem tend to be nonspecific, such as vomiting or diarrhea, and can be caused by any number of problems. This is known as alimentary lymphoma.A rarer form of lymphoma affects a lymph gland inside the chest, which sits centrally between the right and left lungs. This is known as mediastinal lymphoma. Older cats can be prone to lymphoma affecting the kidneys and this is known as renal lymphoma. The alimentary, renal, or intestinal forms can be difficult to diagnose because the swelling is internal. The vet will perform an ultrasound exam and attempt an ultrasound guided biopsy or to harvest a fine needle aspirate using the ultrasound to guide the needle placement. The easiest to diagnose is when the lymphocytes accumulate in lymph nodes. This is because these are located external to the body cavities and are easy to feel when they are enlarged. This is known as multicentric lymphoma.  , Treatment usually involves chemotherapy. However, surgical removal of a discrete intestinal mass may be possible. These treatment options can cost quite a bit, so you should discuss the cost before scheduling the surgery.   Even with treatment, lymphosarcoma is not usually curable. Treatment can extend your cat's life for months, or even years, but does not usually eliminate the condition all together.Consider getting pet insurance while your cat is in good health. This will help to offset the cost of expensive medical treatments, such as this.

"['live in the moment', ""don't be needy"", 'stay confident', 'be positive']",How to Meet New People1," If you want to meet new people without being creepy, the first thing you have to do is stop worrying about how you come off and to enjoy the present moment of the new conversation. Let go of your expectations, ego, and fears, all of which can prevent a conversation from unfolding organically. Learn to focus on the other person so that you can drown out your inner nag and stop being distracted from interesting points of discussion and exploration.   When you approach a new person, don't ask yourself, ""How do I look?"" or ""How do I sound?"" Instead, ask, ""What would this person like to talk about?"" ""What matters to this person?"" You can keep the momentum going by being one step ahead of the person you're talking to by thinking about what to say next, instead of falling behind and obsessing over something you said or did five minutes ago that might have come off the wrong way.; , Neediness is a precursor to obsessiveness, and obsessiveness is creepy. Needy people are imbalanced and unstable because their happiness hinges too greatly on someone else. If you're projecting a vibe that you'll be devastated if a person doesn't want to be your friend or romantic partner, it's time to slow down, be patient, and examine yourself.   If you really click with someone you meet, don't be too quick to say, ""I like you!"" or ""You're really awesome!"" unless you're getting a really positive vibe from the other person. Whether you're meeting a potential friend or romantic partner, don't ask for the person's number in the middle or the conversation or as soon as you think you click. Instead, wait until the end to ask -- it's a more natural time to ask. If you meet someone who you think will be a great friend, you can casually say, ""We should check out that new movie together,"" or ""I'd love to check out that yoga class you're talking about"" -- don't invite the person to do anything too intense at first. Don't ask the person to go out on a long hike with you, go to a family dinner with you, or to help you go underwear shopping. Keep it casual at first, or you'll look too eager. Avoid sounding creepy or desperate by not saying things like, ""I don't have many friends -- it would be great to hang out with you!""  , You may be doubting yourself, but you'll be much more likely to come off as not creepy if you keep up your confidence and make other people feel that you're a person who is worth talking to. You should be confident before you walk into a room with new people in it and build your confidence as the conversation goes along. Just smile, talk about the things that you love, and show everyone that you love who you are, where you are, and what you do.   Body language can help you stay confident. Stand tall, maintain eye contact, and don't fidget with your hands or look at the floor. Don't check your reflection in your mirror or in reflective surfaces, or people will see that you're doubting yourself. When you introduce yourself, speak clearly and loudly enough that you'll be heard.  , Maintaining a positive attitude -- without seeming too excited -- will make people want to talk to you. You should smile or laugh from time to time without keeping a creepy grin plastered on your face or laughing at things that aren't funny. Talk about the things you love, the things that make you happy, and your interests (as long as they aren't too off-putting at first -- avoid mentioning taxidermy or Facebook stalking on your first go-around) to keep people engaged.   If you talk about your long-standing hatred for a certain teacher, classmate, or celebrity, then yeah, you will come off as creepy. Don't nod and agree with what the person is saying every five seconds like a little lap dog -- that will definitely be creepy. The occasional, ""That's so true!"" or ""I know exactly what you mean!"" will be far more positive and far less creepy.  ",['moment']
"['make flash cards', 'form a study group', 'write in pen', 'study every day', 'attend class', 'get proper sleep', 'exercise', 'and nutrition', 'set up a good study space']",How to Study Organic Chemistry Effectively2," Organic chemistry is all about learning chemical structures and reactions. There is also a lot of vocabulary that is specific to the subject. It is very difficult to understand the material if you don’t know what all of the words mean. Use flash cards to help you learn the vocabulary.Once you have mastered the vocabulary, make new flashcards for reactions and structures.  , Study groups are a great way to check your understanding and gain new insight into the material. When explaining a concept to others, you may realize that there is something you were missing. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the material itself. At the same time, other members of the group can help you learn concepts that are difficult for you.Choose study partners that learn at the same rate you do. If the group is too fast or too slow for you, it won’t be as beneficial.  , When using a pencil, it is easy to just write everything down, erase, and then keep writing more. When you use a pen, you have to think through the material critically before writing anything down to avoid having to scribble things out.While this may not work for everyone, it is good to try it out and see if it helps you think ideas through properly before writing them down.  , Studying for an hour or two each day is a much better use of your time than trying to study for 5+ hours all at once. With smaller, more frequent study sessions, you can focus on individual concepts and not burn yourself out trying to cram all of the information into your brain at once.Break up your studying into large and small blocks of time. If you only have ten minutes, flip through some flashcards. If you have an hour or two, do practice problems.  , This may seem obvious, but a lot of effort put into learning material is just about showing up to class. Paying attention in class and taking relevant notes is also necessary. Be strategic about note-taking. Don’t take notes just to take notes. Listen to what the professor is saying and then summarize the information in your notes.If something you wrote during class doesn’t make sense, attend office hours to ask for clarification.  , The key to success when studying any subject is to maintain your health.Getting the proper amount of sleep, exercising a few times a week, and keeping a nutritious diet are all necessary to keeping yourself healthy and ready for work. Doing these three things will help keep your energy up and help you maintain the information that you are learning.   Try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Make time for exercise, even if it’s just a walk with a friend. Make an effort to eat more fruits and vegetables and stay away from sodas and excess caffeine.  , Choose a study space that works best for you. Do you get more done when there’s absolute silence or when there’s a little bit of background noise? A good study space has plenty of lighting, is a comfortable temperature, has minimal distractions, and is comfortable, but not too comfortable.Make sure you have plenty of space to spread out. Keep your study space stocked with everything you will need (paper, calculator, scissors, snacks, etc.) so you won’t have to go hunting and get distracted.

They will crust over and then fall off on their own. If you scratch them, they will open up and become more susceptible to infection.   You will also spread bacteria with your hands if you scratch at the blisters. If this does happen inadvertently, always wash your hands afterward to stay hygienic.; , Baking soda has a pH greater than 7 (making it alkaline), giving it the ability to neutralize the chemical that creates the itching sensation. The chemical creating the itching sensation is acidic with a pH that is less than 7.Apply a paste made of 3 teaspoons baking soda mixed with 1 teaspoon of water. This relieves itching and helps the blisters dry out quicker. You can apply this paste as often as needed to relieve the itching.  , Use a cool, moist compress to ease discomfort. You can apply this compress for up to 20 minutes at a time, several times a day.   You can make a cold compress by wrapping an ice block in a clean towel and pressing it against your skin. Alternatively, you can use a bag of frozen vegetables. Just make sure not to put it directly on your skin and not to keep it on your skin for more than 20 minutes at a time as both of these conditions can lead to tissue damage.  , Apply a topical cream, such as nonprescription benzocaine cream, directly after your cool compress application. Benzocaine works as an anesthetic, numbing the nerve endings in the skin., Infected sores are bad news, so if you think that your sores may be infected, you should contact your doctor immediately. Signs that your sores are infected include:A fever An increase in inflammation that causes additional pain The sore feels warm to the touch The sore is shiny and smooth Your symptoms are getting worse  , You can soak any infected sores in Burow’s solution (commercial name, Domeboro) or tap water. This helps to decrease oozing, clean away any crusting and soothe the skin.Burow’s solution has antibacterial and astringent properties. You can purchase it without a prescription at your local pharmacy. Instead of soaking your sores, you can also apply the Burow’s solution directly onto your sores via the cold compress. You can apply the compress for up to 20 minutes, several times a day.  , Once a lesion has crusted over, you can apply capsaicin cream (e.g. Zostrix) to it. You can apply the capsaicin cream up to 5 times a day in order to promote healing.  , After the blisters have healed, you can apply a 5% lidocaine patch to your skin to reduce nerve pain. The lidocaine patch provides effective pain relief without the risk of negative side effects   These are available at most pharmacies and online. Stronger patches may be available through your doctor.  , Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) are often prescribed in addition to other narcotic medications in order to boost pain relief. They are inexpensive and odds are you already have at least one in your bathroom cabinet.   Examples of NSAIDs include acetaminophen, ibuprofen or indomethacin. These medications can be taken up to three times per day – just be sure to follow the label for instructions on the appropriate dosage for you.  , Corticosteroids are often prescribed for relatively healthy elderly people who present with moderate to severe nerve pain. The corticosteroids are often prescribed in addition to antiviral medications.   Talk to your doctor about this option. Effective (that is, stronger) corticosteroids are available by prescription only.  , Narcotic analgesics are sometimes prescribed to treat severe nerve pain caused by shingles. However, narcotics only provide symptomatic relief – they do not treat the cause of the pain.   In addition, narcotics are addictive substances which the patient can quickly become dependent on. Therefore their use must be carefully monitored by a physician.  , Sometimes tricyclic antidepressants are prescribed to treat specific types of nerve pain caused by shingles. Although their exact mechanism is unknown, they work by blocking pain receptors in the body.  , Antiepileptic drugs are widely used in pain clinics to treat neuropathic pain. There are many types of antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and gabapentin, any of which may be prescribed to treat nerve pain in shingles patients.   For the above two steps, your doctor will know if these are viable treatments for you. In general, these two are reserved for more serious cases of nerve pain.  , One of the simplest surgical techniques for relieving nerve pain is an injection of alcohol or phenol into the peripheral branch of the nerve. This causes permanent damage to the nerve, thus helping to prevent pain.   This is a procedure done by a medical professional. Your health history and condition will determine if this is a suitable route to pursue.  , This treatment involves the placement of electrodes over the nerves that are causing the pain. These electrodes deliver tiny, painless electrical impulses to nearby nerve pathways.   Exactly how these impulses relieve pain is uncertain. One theory is that the impulses stimulate the production of endorphins, your body’s natural painkillers. Unfortunately, this treatment doesn’t work for everyone, but it tends to be more effective if it is given in conjunction with a drug called pregabalin.  , These devices are similar to TENS, but are implanted ‘’underneath’’ the skin. Like TENS units, you can turn these units on and off as needed to control pain.   Before the device is surgically implanted, doctors do a trial first using a thin wire electrode. The trial is done to ensure that the stimulator will provide effective pain relief. The electrode is inserted through your skin into the epidural space over the spinal cord for a spinal cord stimulator, or under your skin above a peripheral nerve in the case of a peripheral nerve stimulator.  , This a very safe and effective form of pain relief that uses radiofrequency to modulate pain at a molecular level. After a single treatment, the pain relief can last for up to 12 weeks.  , Shingles first presents as pain, itching and tingling of the skin. Sometimes these initial symptoms are followed by confusion, fatigue, fever, headache, memory loss, an upset stomach and/or stomach pain.   Up to five days after the appearance of these initial symptoms, a painful rash may appear on one side of the face or body.  , If you think you have shingles, visit your physician within 24 to 72 hours. Antiviral drugs like famciclovir, valtrex and acyclovir can be used to effectively treat the symptoms of shingles, but only if they are started within 72 hours of onset., In addition to antiviral medications, your physician may prescribe a topical medication, such as caladryl. Caladryl may help your already open lesions by reducing pain and itching.   Caladryl works by interfering with the pain signals the nerves send to the brain and is available in gel, lotion, spray or stick form. Caladryl may be applied every 6 hours, up to 4 times a day. You need to wash and dry the affected area prior to application.

Even if you think your boss was at fault, if you want your job back you will have to submit to them. You need to focus on your own attitude and desires. How can you adapt your attitude to be accepting of a future working in the company you just quit?   If you go into a program and successfully complete it, be sure to inform your former employer of your success. This shows maturity and growth.  , Apologize to your previous employer and boss letting them know you regret your decision. That your attitude has changed and you have realized your mistake. If there were hard feelings, ask your employer to forgive your bad behavior and reassure them that you have changed. If they hire your back, they can depend on you long term.   Try to make your apology sincere by doing so in the most thoughtful way possible. Avoid apologizing by text or email. You should apologize face-to-face if possible. By phone if not. If you get their voicemail, ask for a call back or let them know you will call back. Do not apologize by voicemail. In your apology, admit fault and responsibility. Be sincere and let them know you know you made a mistake. If you said anything inappropriate, be sure to note you are sorry about that too. Don't be clever. ""I'm sorry, I was wrong"" shows strength of character.  , Go ahead and do this so you can resubmit it in the future. Take time to polish it so it looks remarkable. You want to show your previous employer you can act professionally.  , Go ahead and submit your résumé or vitae to your previous employer even if they are not hiring. You may decide to use your internal contacts to forward your résumé or vitae to the right person.   When you submit your updated materials, do so widely. Give them to the hiring personnel as well as your former boss. You may want to let other managers you were on good terms with know you are looking for work again. This way you follow the proper procedures by filing with the hiring people and you can get others interested in hiring you.  , The goal here is to show you are reliable. Even if you were not reliable in the past you can highlight your past mistakes and how you have resolved them. You are more reliable now than before because you resolved your issues.  , Your boss or employer may be amicable to your return pending some sort of penance. They may accept you back at lower pay or in a different, less desirable position. If you want your job back, accept their conditions but emphasize you want your old job back. Then you can show them how serious you are about reacquiring your old job. This will give you time to re-earn their respect.   Don't allow yourself to be demeaned too much.

Ask friends or family for recommendations.; , Check the addresses, to see which hair salons are local to you. It's worth trying local salons first, for if you find one you love that is close to you, it removes the stress of having to add travel as a consideration whenever visiting the salon. It won't always work out but it's worth at least looking.   Go to your local shopping mall or plaza, and check out what kind of salons they have there. Don't presume that just because a hair salon has a fancy central business district street address that it must be automatically the best place to go to. Sometimes such a place can be snooty and overpriced while the local one might be spot on in affordable pricing and filled with lovely and caring stylists.  , Look at the prices of the various services, and compare them with the prices of some of the other salons that you have been to. Consider your own determination of what is reasonable by way of prices in the salon. If you don't think they're reasonable, then that salon won't work for you at all. On the other hand, if they are reasonable, you can try the place out.   Ask about special deals and customer loyalty programs. Many good stylists will offer some sort of regular customer deal that can end up with free treatments, haircuts or styling if you attend regularly over a period of time.  , Take a look at the presentation of the place. The whole place should be clean and tidy. Notice how the brushes and combs are kept clean. Look at the bench tops and floor to determine how often these are wiped and swept. Check the neatness and cleanliness of the staff aprons. See how clean the sinks are.  , As soon as you walk in, there should be a staff at the reception. Do they greet you warmly? Is someone available to assist you fairly quickly? Or, are you made to wait a long time or rudely waved to sit down until someone is free? Each of the ways in which you're treated upon arriving is an indication of how the salon is run as a whole and provides you with notice of what to expect by way of service.   How comfortable does the place make you feel upon entering? Trust that initial reaction.  , The staff should be respectful and present themselves smartly. This counts for uniform (not scruffy) and personality. They should meet the standards of professionalism, should be friendly, and nice to talk to.  , A hair salon should use professional products only (that means not products you'd find in the pharmacy). The products should be new, clean (not dusty) and obviously getting a good turnover. Check the prices as well; are you going to be able to afford the products if you want them?  , Study the quality of customers' hair as soon as they walk out the hair salon. Don't judge it when it has gone a day or two, as not all customers have the ability to keep their hair looking good. It all depends on what products they use to maintain the look, how long they leave the colour (if coloured) etc.  , This isn't a firm decision, it's a trial. If this place doesn't turn out the way you'd like it, you can go somewhere else next time. If you're unsure about the service, don't ask for the complicated styling options first; try something easy to begin with, to allow you to gauge the manner of the stylists and their competence. For example, begin with just a shampoo and style. It's a great way to ""interview"" a stylist without the commitment of a haircut. If you trust them after that, you can book another appointment for the full haircut and color, etc.   Give the hair salon a quick ring. The member of staff answering should answer with ""good morning/afternoon"", mention the name of the salon, and ask how they can help you. They should be professional, not use slang words, be friendly, and pleasant. But most of all - they should be polite and have good manners.  , This should include filling out a card with details about yourself, your preferences and the like. A stylist should always conduct a thorough consultation. Questions may include likes and dislikes with current hairstyles, showing you images and respectfully dealing with any images you've brought along.  , Does the stylist actually know what they're talking about? For example, if you ask what hairstyle would suit your face shape, does the stylist actually know how to match face shape to haircut or do you have the impression that the stylist is just making it up or simply going along with you by agreeing the latest celebrity trend would look good on you? You want honest assessments that truly work out for you, not someone just after money or moving you along quickly. You also want competence, not someone who doesn't really know what they're talking about.   Do you ""click"" with the stylist? Sometimes you might need to change stylists within the same salon, perhaps one that is more senior and knowledgeable or one with whom you feel a better connection. Don't be afraid to ask for this switch, they understand that customers have different needs and likes.  , A good stylist won't spend time pointing out your imperfections and try to push hair care products on you from the moment you start. A good stylist will aim to accept your hair's limitations, work with those realistically and will do their best to make you feel good about yourself, not worse. Things to watch out for include:   In what way does the stylist point out how ""thin, lank, weak, terrible, etc."" your hair is? It might be a fact and you're probably well aware of it but going on about it for five minutes will only make you feel worse. If they mention it politely and provide a quick, positive solution, then that's a sign they're not going to keep harping on about it. Does the stylist make statements about your hair that are patently untrue, in order to sell you store products to ""fix"" it? In this case, be wary. What happens when you insist you already use decent products at home? If the stylist grimaces and suggests that your choices aren't working, that's just rude. Is the stylist considerate of your scalp, face and body in general? Some stylists are gentle and careful, others poke combs, scissors and equipment into your head and pull hair, or use overly hot water on your scalp, all without apologizing or even noticing. What happens if you ask the stylist to be more careful? Does he or she respond or just lapse back into hurting you again? This goes toward the conscientiousness and considerateness of the stylist and salon as a whole. How much undivided attention do you get? Does the stylist stay with you or keep running off to attend to other clients? If they do so, are they polite about it or are you made to wait far too long? Consider how you feel about this.  , Did you feel comfortable? Are you happy with the results? Was the stylist receptive to your requests? Was the whole service in line with your expectations? If the answers are predominantly yes, then you've found a great hair stylist for the coming months or maybe even years. If not, select another salon and keep looking until you find the one that works for you.

"['remind yourself why treatment is important', 'commit to treatment', 'choose a bipolar specialist', 'take medication', 'go to therapy', 'manage your symptoms']",How to Accept a Bipolar Disorder Diagnosis3," Deciding to get treatment may feel like giving up or admitting defeat. That is an unhealthy way of thinking about your treatment. Bipolar treatment is very effective and can make your life better. Untreated bipolar is dangerous and can lead to destructive behavior.Be honest with yourself about your bipolar, your symptoms, and your actions. You may be productive in manic phases, but make a list of the negatives. Have you had relationship problems? Participated in unsafe or risky behaviors? Gotten into debt? Left untreated, bipolar can have a negative effect on your life.  , One way to fully accept your diagnosis is to commit yourself to following your treatment. This means you go to your doctor’s appointments, you take your medication, and you make the appropriate lifestyle changes.It is important to continue your treatment even if you start to feel better.   Only going halfway with your treatment is telling yourself you don’t need help because there’s nothing wrong with you.  , When you are searching for a doctor to treat your bipolar, you should find one who specializes in bipolar disorder. Not all psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists have experience treating the same thing. When you go to the doctor, ask them about their experience treating bipolar disorder.When you are searching for psychiatrists online or through your insurance company, you can usually find a list of the psychiatrist’s specializations in the info section. If you are unsure, contact the psychiatrist’s office to find out. Ask your general practitioner for a referral for a good clinic. You may have a treatment team that includes a doctor or psychiatrist who handles your medication and a therapist, psychologist, or licensed social worker who oversees your therapy.  , Treatment for bipolar generally combines medication with therapy. Not everyone responds to medication the same way, so you may try a few different types of medications before choosing the right one for you. Discuss your medication options with your doctor.The medications prescribed for bipolar disorder are mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants. The aim of medication is to stabilize your moods., Psychotherapy is a common treatment for bipolar disorder. Often, you will receive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In cognitive behavioral therapy, you work on replacing negative thought patterns with healthier ones. For bipolar, you and your therapist work on identifying and avoiding triggers, problem solving skills, and managing your symptoms.Another common therapy for bipolar is interpersonal and social rhythm therapy. Interpersonal therapy works on helping you improve your relationships. Improving relationships can help reduce stress, which is a big trigger for bipolar. Social rhythm therapy works on getting your daily routine normalized by helping you adopt better sleeping, eating, and exercising schedules.  , Certain lifestyle changes can help you manage your bipolar disorder. You should get on a regular sleep schedule. Getting enough rest helps keep your mood level. Regular exercising also helps with your symptoms. Exercise is a natural mood booster and can help you feel better.Work on stress relieving techniques. This may include yoga, Tai Chi, exercise, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. Refrain from using drugs or alcohol. Both of these things can exacerbate mood swings and trigger relapses.  ","['therapy', 'symptoms', 'bipolar specialist', 'medication', 'treatment']"

That's because with a thicker cut it's easier to get a nice, crispy crust on the outside without overcooking the inside. The best thickness for filet mignon is anywhere from 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) thick.That may seem like a very thick cut, but remember that the steak will shrink a bit as it cooks.          Go to your local butcher and ask him to cut the filet from the tenderloin. This ensures both a fresher cut and the ability to specify how thick you want your filet to be. Oh, and you get to support your local butcher instead of a supermarket conglomerate. What if you have a thin cut of filet mignon? Don't fret, but adjust your cooking accordingly. Instead of slow-cooking your filet, you'll need to sear it over extremely high heat for a short period of time to get a crispy outside and a juicy, medium-rare inside.; , Beware of recipes that call for rubs or marinades when it comes to filet mignon. All you need is salt and pepper. Using rubs or marinades on filet mignon is likely to make the meat less tasty, not more.         , Some cooks choose to salt the steak after cooking it, and that's perfectly acceptable. Most cooks, however, salt the filet before grilling, although many of them make the mistake of salting too soon before cooking. Salt at least 40 minutes to an hour before grilling.         Salt brings moisture out to the surface of the steak. Wouldn't that be bad news for a moist, juicy steak? you ask. It is, if you don't salt far enough in advance.  For the first 30 minutes of salting, moisture comes out to the surface of the steak, accumulating in small puddles. At this point, cooking the steak would be ill-advised. After 30 minutes, some of the moisture drawn out by the salt seeps back into the meat. The process is called osmosis, and it also makes for more tender meat.The longer you leave your steaks out after 40 minutes, the more of the salty water travels back into the steak, flavoring and tenderizing it.    , Most cooks do this while they're waiting for the salt to do its thing. Meat that has come to room temperature before cooking cooks faster and more evenly.Gone are the days of charred outsides and cold insides.         , Gas grills aren't horrible, but they don't burn hot and can impart a gasoline smell to your precious steaks. (Ew.) Stick to charcoal instead. Funny as it might seem, using charcoal instead of gas gives you greater control over the cooking process.         That's because charcoal is a really solid heat source. It burns hot — much hotter than gas — and burns steadily. If you know how to master charcoal, it gives you a better final product. Briquettes are fine, but they're nothing special. Many of them have unwanted additives that give off a faint aroma, so if used, they should be white all over before you start grilling.Lump charcoal burns hotter, is easier to adjust the temperature, and is all-natural.  , Move all your coals over to one half of the grill; that will be your ""hot"" half. The half without any coals will be your ""cool"" side.         , Many choose to use a neutral oil, like groundnut oil, because it doesn't have much of a taste. Olive oil is perfectly acceptable for a more distinct taste. Remember that a little oil goes a long way. Use no more than a tablespoon for each filet.         , There are pretty much two camps when it comes to how to cook meat: the high heat camp and the low heat camp.          The high heat camp is straightforward: Cook the filet for 2-5 minutes per side over high heat, searing it to seal in the juices. While this method can certainly produce a fine filet mignon, the ""searing to seal in the juices"" idea has been debunked.In fact, the temperature to which you cook the meat is the most important factor in keeping meat juicy. Placing it over high heat will accelerate the loss of juices. The low heat camp uses this fact — the hotter the temperature, the more juices lost — to champion a different approach. Instead of searing first, the meat is cooked over indirect, ""cool"" heat until it's just below its ideal temperature. It's then seared to develop a crust and depth of flavor.  , Placing over indirect heat will slow the loss of juices, cooking the steak while keeping it moist. Don't be afraid to stick a meat thermometer into your filet. It's a myth and old wives' tale that piercing your filet with a thermometer one time will cause all its juices to run out.(If you don't have a thermometer, you can always use the finger test, although it's less reliable.)          120° F (48.8° C) = Rare 130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare 140° F (60° C) = Medium 150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well 160° F (71.1° C) = Well done  ,, The steak will continue cooking even after it has been removed from the heat.        , Cover the steak with aluminum foil and let rest for a while, even if the temptation is killing you. A steak that is cut into immediately after cooking will lose more of its juices than a steak that is allowed to rest for 10 minutes.         When a steak is cooked, its muscles tighten up on the outside. This pushes all the juices to the inside of the meat, where the muscles aren't as tight because they're not as hot. If you cut into the center of your filet immediately after cooking, the juices accumulated there will simply run out, leaving you with a drier steak. If you let your filet rest, however, the muscles begin to relax and the juices move from the center of the steak back out, dispersing more evenly. You'll hold on to 7% more weight in juices by waiting an extra 10 minutes after cooking has finished., Many chefs hold off on peppering the steak until after it's been grilled because they don't want the pepper to be burned while grilling. If you're the type of chef who doesn't mind burned pepper mingling with your filet mignon, go ahead and pepper when you salt the filet. If not, pepper now, right before serving.         , Savor each tender, buttery, succulent bite and give thanks to the being that created such a delicious cut of meat.

Scrub the inside and outside of the jar with a clean sponge or washcloth and rinse with hot water.   Choose a jar made of glass or food-grade plastic. Metal and plastic jars that are not food-grade may shed potentially harmful chemicals into the juice as it ferments. The jar must be at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) tall by 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter. The average noni fruit is about 4 to 5 inches tall (10 to 13 centimeters).; , Ripe noni fruit is a honey-yellow color. It is important that you pick the fruit before it turns completely white. If picking noni fruits by hand instead of purchasing them, remove the fruit carefully to avoid snapping the thin branches of the plant.  , Rinse the noni fruit under running water to remove any dirt. Place them in the sun and allow the fruit to dry for several hours. After several hours pass, the flesh will appear soft and translucent. The fruit will also begin to take on a foul odor. This is the stage you want the noni fruit to reach before fermenting.  , Fix the lid firmly onto the container, but do not take any additional measures to make the jar airtight. Allowing air to flow into the container openly can lead to contamination, making the lid necessary. Gases build up during the fermentation process, however. If you do not have a big enough jar, they can create a dangerous amount of pressure, but many of these gases may be able to force themselves out through the small gap that exists between the lid and container.  , Place the jar outside, preferably in a sunny location. During this time, the juice will seep out of the fruit naturally. It is initially a light amber color, but it will darken as the weeks pass.  , Juice is not the only thing to develop as the juice ferments. Pulp and other debris will also be mixed into the juice and must be filtered out. Pour the juice through a wire mesh strainer with small gaps and into a second sterilized jar. The juice should pour through relatively easily and should not need much, if any, assistance to flow through the mesh.   You can also use silkscreen, paint strainers, or cheesecloth to make sure that as much sediment as possible is separated from the noni juice.  , You can drink unpasteurized juice, but pasteurized juice lasts longer and is safer to drink. Place the open jar of noni juice into a pot of boiling water. The water level should cover that of the juice, but it should not be so high that it threatens to enter the mouth of the jar. Once the temperature of the juice reaches 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82.2 degrees Celsius), allow the juice to boil for 30 minutes before removing the jar from the water.  , Use litmus paper to check the pH of the juice. Properly fermented juice should have a pH of 3.5 or less. Anything higher may suggest that the noni juice has been contaminated.  , Fermented noni juice can technically be stored at room temperature for an indefinite period of time, but storing it in the refrigerator ensures optimal freshness. As a general rule, you may also want to consider disposing of fermented noni juice after two years just to keep your supply as fresh as possible.

Go to the city, county, state or federal website where you think you might have a warrant for arrest. Government websites are kept up-to-date, which makes them a reliable way to get information.All federal government websites end in .gov, while those for states can end in either .gov or .us. Look for the ""Legal"" or ""Health and Safety"" sections to see if they offer a warrant search. Alternatively, try entering a phrase such as ""arrest warrant"" in the search bar on the website's home page. Some counties do not offer online warrant searches. In that case, look at the local sheriff or police department site for contact information.; , If you would like to speak to someone, you can call the court directly. You can call any court in the state that you believe the warrant may be in, because states maintain a warrant database that can be accessed from any state court. Do not identify yourself; instead, simply ask if there is an outstanding warrant for ""Person X"" (using your name here) in a criminal or civil case. Have the following information ready: the case number (if you know it), name, birth date, and Social Security number.The court clerk of one circuit may not be able to give you information if you have an arrest warrant from a different circuit court. Keep in mind that for some cases such as family and juvenile delinquency cases, and domestic violence cases involving protective, peace, or restraining orders, you may not be able to find information through the court clerk. However, the clerk should still be able to tell you about an arrest warrant, even if he or she cannot give your specific information on the case itself. Criminal cases are mostly public record, so you should not have an issue getting information on these. However, some types of civil cases are not public record, such as family and juvenile delinquency cases, and domestic violence cases involving protective, peace, or restraining orders. For these types of cases, consider consulting a bail bondsman or attorney. You can also call the county, state, or federal clerk's office. Note that if you call from your own phone, the police may be able to locate and arrest you. They can trace the phone number to an address, or to any billing information associated with that phone number. If you are nervous about calling yourself, ask a close friend or family member to call for you., You can use the computers at your county court to search warrants. If you feel uncomfortable doing this yourself, ask someone to do it for you (a friend, family member, attorney, or bail bondsman).   Most minor offenses will not lead to an immediate arrest. You may be able to pay a fine and settle the matter quickly.Be warned, however, that if there is warrant issued for you, you risk being taken into custody.  , There are a number of websites that can perform a warrant search for you. Some are free, and others charge a fee.These services are quick and easy, but may not give you all of the information you're looking for. For example, they may provide vital statistics and property ownership, but not information about arrest warrants. For this reason, these services should be a last resort., Sometimes people can be completely unaware that they have a warrant out for their arrest. Knowing when the warrant was issued could shed light on some important details.   There may be fines associated with your charge that have been accumulating since the warrant was issued. These will be listed among the warrant information. If the warrant was issued a long time ago, you’ll want to get the matter settled quickly before incurring any further penalties. Additionally, in some case, if the warrant was issued long ago, a person cannot be prosecuted for the crime. It is not that the warrant has expired, but some crimes have a limited statute of limitations (period in which the suspect can be prosecuted). Therefore, if you believe that you may have a warrant out for your arrest for an underlying incident that occurred over 2 years ago, look up the charge that would appear on the warrant (or something similar) to see if there is a limit on the time that the warrant would be valid., If you know what you’re being charged with, you can more adequately prepare your response. Vital information includes the date of offense, the details of the charges, and the case type (e.g., felony, misdemeanor, traffic ticket, etc.).You may be able to avoid being arrested by paying a fine. The severity of your charge may influence your choice of legal representation. Also note any date of conviction, sentencing, disposition, and probation, if they apply to your case.  , If you’re concerned that you will go to jail, knowing the predetermined bail amount for your charge could help you raise the funds to avoid jail time while awaiting your trial.  , Regardless of the charge, the best thing you can do for yourself is to respond quickly. Being proactive about your warrant helps you avoid being arrested publicly and at inopportune times. Moreover, it limits any accruing fees.  , In the event that a warrant has been issued for a major offense, you will most likely want to contact a criminal defense lawyer. An attorney can help you understand your warrant and will make suggestions as to possible next steps. In addition, an attorney can accompany you to the local court to inquire about your warrant. Bring the warrant number and all relevant information you have so far.Find an attorney that specializes in your type of case (you should know the case type from the warrant information – see Part 2, Step 2). Avoid picking the first name you see in the phonebook or any other advertisement. Instead, get a referral from someone who's been in a similar situation, or someone knows a good attorney. You can also find attorneys by looking at your state bar association website. (A directory of state bar associations can be found at http://shop.americanbar.org.) Meet with the attorney first to make sure that they're someone you're comfortable with and can trust. If you're unable to pay for a lawyer, contact the public defender's office of the county where your warrant was issued. Ask to speak with the duty attorney and explain you'd like to clear your warrant.  , Turning yourself in can help make the process smoother, reducing the risk of more severe punishment and fines, and, in some cases, the creation of a criminal record.   Start by turning yourself in to the courthouse clerk. Ask for information about what steps to take next, but make sure you have the right clerk. For county and state warrants, talk to the county clerk; for federal warrants, talk to the clerk of the U.S. District Court. Bring an attorney or legal representative with you for advice. Some misdemeanor and minor charges may be taken care of without a hearing. If you turn yourself in to a police station, you may end up being put directly in jail until your appointed time in court. A court-appointed attorney will be provided for you if you turn yourself in.  , This will only catch up to you. The next time you get pulled over for speeding, or even go the county clerk’s office for routine matters, you could be arrested on the spot.

The Extractor blade is used to blend all fruits and vegetables into drinks, and the Milling blade is used to turn dry ingredients into powers. You will change this blade depending on what you are making, a drink or a powder.; , A kitchen counter or table is best. Keep the NutriBullet base away from water when you are using it. Now, plug in the Power Base. This is the part of the NutriBullet you will plug in and will place the cup onto.  , Use fruits and vegetables that you like to make a nutritious drink, or fill the cup with ingredients you want to turn into powder, like nuts or seeds. The Tall Cup NutriBullet has the capacity to hold 24 ounces and the Short Cup has the capacity to hold 18 ounces. Do not fill the cup past the max line.   For nutritious drinks, add 50% fruit and 50% leafy greens. This will make a drink filled with vitamins. Cut the vegetables or fruits in halves or quarters if they do not fit into the cup. Fill the cup up with almonds or oats to make a powdery substance you can then eat in yogurt or on top of cereal.  , The amount of liquid you use will determine the consistency of your drink, so use less liquid for a chunkier drink. Never fill the cup past the fill line. You can use water, juice, almond milk, or any liquid of your choice.  , Once you place the ingredients of your drink or powder in the Tall or Short Cup, cap the cup with the Extractor or Milling blade. Press down and twist, screwing the blade on until it is securely attached to the cup.  , There are two notches on either side of the NutriBullet logo on the base. There are also two round protrusions on the cup with your ingredients; line up these notches and protrusions. Then, simply push the cup down, and your ingredients will mix.   Lift the cup up and out to stop it. Mixing the ingredients should only take a few seconds.  , Sometimes, ingredients will get stuck, especially if you do not put enough liquid in the cup. Tap or shake the cup to loosen these ingredients so everything mixes together.   You can also add more liquid if desired by removing the cup from the Power Base, removing the blade, and then adding more liquid. Feel free to shake or tap the entire NutriBullet without removing the cup from the base.  , Each NutriBullet comes with two re-sealable lids in case you do not finish your drink. Place them tightly on the cup, then refrigerate for up to 2 days., Do not place the blade or base in the dishwasher, however. Wash the cup and lids on a normal cycle.  , Use regular dish soap and warm water to rinse the cup and blade, but be careful handling the extremely sharp blade.  , Unplug the NutriBullet base before cleaning. Use a damp rag to wipe away any residue.  , Use the Milling Blade for this cleanup. Fill the cup 2/3 of the way with soap, then blend for 30 seconds. Any dry residue should come unstuck. Now, you can clean the NutriBullet in your regular fashion, by hand or in the dishwasher.

"['ask about next steps at your interview', 'don’t ask if you got the job right away', 'send a thank you note after your interview', 'time your follow up email', 'remind the hiring manager who you are', 'let the hiring manager know if you’ve had other offers', 'limit your check-ins']",How to Ask if You Got the Job," At the end of your interview, the hiring manager will likely ask you if you have any questions. This is a great time to ask more about the company or specific job, but you should also ask what happens next.For example, ask the hiring manager how long the post-interview process might take, if you can expect to hear from the company whether you got the job or not, and when you might hear something. You can also ask what the best way is of contacting the hiring manager if you have questions.; , If your interview goes well, you might be tempted to ask the hiring manager on the spot if you got the job. Don’t do this. It can make you look desperate, which can be a turn off for the hiring manager.It’s also likely that the hiring manager won’t be able to give you an answer right away. They may have more candidates to interview, or they might need to discuss all of the candidates with a larger group of people.  , This isn’t directly related to asking if you got the job, but it will keep you on the mind of the hiring manager. In your note, remind the hiring manager of who you are, what you interviewed for, and something that excites you about the company or position.For example, you can say something like “Dear Jim, I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to interview for the assistant manager position at Jim’s Bakery. I really enjoyed the interview, and I’m so excited about the new products that Jim’s Bakery is innovating!” Don't ask for an update about the position in this note, just use it to thank the manager for interviewing you.  , Give the hiring manager or recruiter some time to go over all of the interviews they did. They might also need to speak to other people in the HR department, and are often prevented from discussing the opening until they’ve been given the green light to hire someone. Give them about a week to deal with those issues before you write a follow up email.If the hiring manager gave you an actual date by which they’re hoping to make a decision, wait a few days after that to follow up. The dates they give are usually optimistic, and other things may have come up.  , Your email should include your name, the position you applied for, and the date of your interview. The better you can remind the hiring manager who you are, the more likely you are to get a response.You can say something like, “Dear Jim, I hope things are going well. I was wondering if you could provide me with an update on the assistant manager position I interviewed for on May 5, 2017] Please let me know if I can provide you with any other information; I look forward to hearing from you.”  , If you’re interviewing for a new position, chances are you’re in the middle of a job search. If you’ve received another offer while waiting to hear from your first choice, let the hiring manager know. This gives you a solid reason to need to know and increases the likelihood that you’ll hear back.You can say something like “Dear Emily, I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check on the status of the coordinator position I interviewed for on January 10. I’ve since received an offer from another company, but I’m still eager to hear from you about joining ABC Consulting. Could you offer me any update on the position? Thanks for your time.”  , If you’re waiting to hear about a job you’re really interested in, it can be tempting to check in until you get an answer, especially if the hiring manager encourages you to continue to do so. You should, however, give yourself a limit for check-ins, usually no more than three. If you don’t get an answer by then, move on to the other positions.If you don’t hear after three check-ins, it doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t get the job. But it does mean that the timeline is definitely longer than you initially thought, and you don’t want to waste energy on it when you could be working on following up on other leads!

"['go to a hardware store for supplies', 'create two soft copper coils', 'place the smaller coil into the larger coil', 'place both coils into a stovepipe', 'connect the coils', 'submerse the pump in an ice chest full of ice water', 'turn on your pump']",How to Make Fog4," You'll need a few basic supplies to build your own fog machine. These supplies should be available at most hardware stores, and are not expensive. Unless you plan to keep your fog machine for a long time, most of these items can be repurposed for other projects. The items you'll need include:   A 2-foot, 6-inch round sheet metal ductwork pipe. This is also known as a stove pipe, and this will be the container that you make your fog inside. A 25-foot length of 1/4-inch copper refrigerator tubing A 50-foot length of 3/8-inch copper refrigerator tubing A 12-foot length of 3/8-inch clear plastic tubing A 2-foot length of 1-1/2 inch pipe (used as a form, then discarded) A 2-foot length of 3-inch ABS plastic pipe (used as a form, then discarded) 4 pipe clamps for the 3/8"" Clear plastic tubing 1 small submersible pump (80 gal/hour) A package of plastic wire ties An ice chest or bucket  , One coil should have a diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) and the other coil should have a diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm). Form the coils by tightly winding soft copper refrigerator tubing around a piece of PVC pipe. You should be able to wind the copper tubing around the pipes using your hands, but if you have difficulty grasping it, you could grab the tubing using pliers.To create the inner coil, wind the 25 foot (7.6 m) copper tubing around a 2 foot (0.61 m) (61 cm) long pipe with a diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). To create the outer coil, wind the 50 feet (15.24 m) copper tubing around a 2 foot (0.61 m) (61 cm) long pipe with a diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm). Slide the coils out of their respective tubes once created.  , Slide the smaller coil directly inside the larger coil and secure it in place by using small wire ties. This allows the fog to pass in and around the coils, which provides the best cooling.If tying the smaller coil in place is too difficult, you can just allow the small coil to lay against the bottom of the larger one. Because the coils will need to fit inside the stove pipe, stretch them out until they roughly match the length of the pipe.  , Slide the larger coil into your stovepipe, using wire ties to hold both coils in place. The goal is to have the two coils as close to the center as possible inside the larger pipe.Hanging the coils in this way allows the fog to pass in and around the coils and cool it even better. The machine will work without using the ties, but it won't work as well.  , At one end of the chiller, connect the ends of the inner and outer coils using short pieces of plastic tubing and pipe clamps.You'll need to connect the ends of the coils on the other side of the chiller to a small submersible pump using longer pieces of plastic tubing and pipe clamps. Cold water will come from the pump, and circulate through the coils.  , The pump should be completely submerged and there should be room for a small commercial fog machine to sit beside it.The water needs to be ice cold in order for the mechanism to work, so you may need to wait 30 minutes or so after dumping the ice in the water before you can create the cold fog. Place your fog machine into the other end of the ice chest. The spout should face outward.  , After a minute or so, cold water should circle through the copper tubing.Test the temperature of the copper by touching it. You should be able to feel the cold water through the sides of the copper. Follow by turning on your fog machine. Fill the fog machine with commercial fog juice and switch it on. Fog should roll out, but instead of floating up as hot fog does, it should sink to the floor thanks to the cooling mechanism.

You can purchase a paper planner that spans one or more years. Pick an attractive planner, so that looking at your schedule is a pleasure. Pick a small or flat planner that will fit in your bag, so you can carry it with you.   If you would rather not carry a planner with you, consider a desk planner that will sit comfortably on a table. Make sure your planner has enough space in it for you to write down your daily activities. If you have a variable schedule with lots of small parts, get a planner with large spaces per day. If you have many ongoing projects with flexible deadlines, pick a planner with small spaces per day but plenty of extra blank page space per week, so you can keep a to-do list. A to-do list that is part of your planner is useful to most people, so consider a planner with facing blank pages for every week.; , If you coordinate your schedule with others, or if you do most things on your phone and computer, it might make more sense for you to pick an application, a website, or an extension of your email services to organize your schedule. You can look up free mobile and web applications that suit your needs. If you plan on sharing information from your online planner with friends, family, or colleagues, ask them what service they use and plan accordingly.  , Most computers come with a calendar application. You can coordinate this application with your email and other websites you use. Search your computer for ""calendar,"" or scroll through your applications folder.  , You can find printable templates online, or you can design your own planner by hand or on your computer. Purchase a case for your planner, such as a three ring binder or a book cover. If you are printing templates and putting them in a binder, use a hole punch on your templates and put them in your binder.   If you are binding your own book, try taking the pages out of an old hardcover book. Lay the cover flat and measure it. Find paper that is slightly smaller than the length and width of your flat cover, or cut paper to size. Fold each individual page in half to make two pages of your book. Using a ruler and pen, colored pencil, marker, or paintbrush, draw lines on each page according to the organizer design you prefer. Look at templates online for ideas. Stack your pages. Make sure they fit in your cover. You may need to create three distinct stacks for your book to lie flat. With your pages now in order, put in dates. Don't forget holidays! Bind your book. Take an awl or large needle. Punch one or two holes in the cover in the same place. Use a sturdy thread to sew together.  , Avoid keeping a long list of tasks that keeps getting longer. Instead, integrate your to-do list into your daily schedule. When you learn of a new task, break it into parts and write each part down under the date that you will do it. Make sure you note its deadline, in case you don't get to it on time.You might want to keep a schedule of daily tasks and a to-do list of running projects, but consider keeping a weekly to-do and a monthly to-do instead of one long list. Keeping a list of unscheduled tasks leads will cause you to burn out on your projects before you even do them.  , Start your day by tackling the most important item on your agenda. Schedule the first order of business to be the one thing you absolutely must accomplish that day. That way, if you are interrupted later, you will have at least done the most important thing. Anything that is due or is especially important is a good candidate for a first task., Schedule every part of each task, including emails you have to send, planning you have to do, and items you need to get. Otherwise you might waste time sitting down to accomplish something only to realize you are missing essential ingredients., Before you start each task, spend a few minutes thinking about what you want your end result to be. This will help you be more directed and focused. Write your goals for each day or each task down in your planner, or simply sit and think. If you are working with someone, state your goals aloud., Devote each block to one task. Multitasking is less efficient as a rule. Focus on one project, even if that project has diverse parts, during each block., Scheduling time off sounds counterintuitive, but it will help. Do not plan on overworking yourself. Working through exhaustion and bodily needs should only happen in emergencies. Schedule short breaks every 45 minutes to an hour, as this is as long as most people can focus.   Take time away from your desk or computer. Schedule time with loved ones, time to prepare meals, and time to be alone. If you are prone to anxiety, try scheduling ""worry time."" That way, if you find yourself spinning into worry while you are trying to work, you can put it aside for later.Schedule downtime and leave your distractions to that time. Instead of constantly checking your phone, your email, and social media, do it during scheduled blocks.

If you’re making a more casual puzzle, though, you can pick whatever size you want.   If you're using an online crossword puzzle maker or puzzle-making software, you may be restricted to a certain range of available sizes. If you're making your puzzle by hand, it’s totally up to you., Usually you'll select words according to a theme of your choosing.That theme, or a clue to it, can then become the title of the puzzle. Examples of common themes include foreign places or languages, words from a certain time period, famous people, and sports.  , This part of the process can feel as challenging as actually solving a crossword puzzle. Once you've laid the words out, black out any unused squares.   In a US style crossword, there should be no “hanging words,” or words that do not connect to other words. Every letter should correspond to both an Across word and a Down word, and be totally interconnected.In a UK style crossword, hanging words are permitted. If the answer to a clue is a phrase rather than a single word, there should be no spaces between the words. You don’t need to worry about capitalizing proper nouns in your answers, as crosswords are usually filled out in all caps. The answers should not include punctuation either. Many crossword puzzle creators automatically lay the words out for you. All you do is specify puzzle size and input the list of words and clues., Begin in the upper-left corner of the puzzle, and divide the words by whether they run vertically or horizontally, so that you have a “1 Down,” and a “1 Across,” etc. This can also be pretty mind-bending, and many people prefer to use software instead of doing it all manually.   If you're using a crossword puzzle creator, it will handle the numbering for you automatically., This time the starting square for each word should be numbered, but the squares themselves should be otherwise blank. If you’re creating your puzzle by hand this will be a bit more labor intensive, but if you’re using a crossword puzzle creator it should be done for you. Set aside the filled-in puzzle for use as an answer key. You can make as many copies of the blank one as you need.  , These are referred to as “quick” or “straight” clues, and are generally the easiest to write and to solve. An example might be “Equine mount” = HORSE.   If you are making a crossword as an educational tool, or just don’t want to make things too complicated, you can use quick clues exclusively, but if you want to make a more challenging puzzle, you will probably want to avoid them, or use them sparingly., These generally involve some sort of metaphor, or rely on lateral thinking. An example might be “Half a dance” = CHA or CAN (taken from Chacha or Cancan).   Crossword creators often indicate this type of clue by beginning with “maybe” or “perhaps,” or by ending the clue with a question mark.  , This type of crossword clue is far more popular in the UK than in the US. You will often find cryptic clues in puzzles specifically designated, “cryptic crosswords,” but if they are found in more general puzzles they will often be indicated by a question mark at the end. They rely on various kinds of word play, and usually involve multiple levels of puzzling out. There is a huge number of sub-types within the cryptic clue category.Purely cryptic clues are, essentially, puns. Thus “Hair style with a comb in it” = BEEHIVE, as “comb” can refer to a hair comb or a honeycomb.Reversals require solving a cryptic clue and then reversing the solution. For example, “Go no further putting the crockery up” = STOP. This is solved by translating “crockery” to “pots,” and then inverting “pots” to get “stop.” Note that the solution is also hinted at by the phrase, “go no further.”Palindromes are often indicated by phrases like “either way” or “up and down.” They involve finding an anagram that works as a solution to a cryptic clue. An example would be “Advance in either direction” = PUT UP, because “to put up” can be another way of saying “to advance,” and is also a palindrome (a word that is spelled the same forwards and backwards.), Number them according to their placement in the puzzle. List all the Across clues together in ascending numerical order, and list all the Down clues together in ascending numerical order., Simon & Schuster are the original crossword puzzle publishers, and they introduced the official standards that professional crossword puzzle creators use. One of these standards is that puzzles must be one of five grid sizes: 15×15, 17×17, 19×19, 21×21 or 23×23.The larger the grid, of course, the more difficult the puzzle., In this context, “diagram” refers to the arrangement of blacked out squares on your grid. These should be arranged so that if you flipped the graph, the blacked out squares would be in the same places., Two-letter words are never allowed, and three-letter words should be used sparingly.If you’re stuck for thinking of big words, remember that it is also acceptable to use phrases., With some exceptions, the words in your puzzle should be words one can find in a dictionary, atlas, work of literature, textbook, almanac, etc.Certain puzzle themes may prompt you to stray a bit from this rule, but don’t overdo it., If one of the phrases in your puzzle is “lost at sea,” you shouldn’t also use “sea salt.” Again, certain themes may give you some degree of flexibility, but you should tread carefully., One hallmark of a well made puzzle is that the longest words are the ones most closely tied into the theme. Not all crossword puzzles have a theme, but most of the best ones do.","['diagram', 'small words', 'indirect clues', 'clues', 'crossword puzzle', 'words', '180-degree rotational symmetry', 'list', 'copy', 'long words count', 'word', 'straightforward clues', 'square', 'standard sizes', 'grid size', 'challenge', 'use cryptic clues', 'list form', 'grid format', 'level']"

Pick this if it is available. If not, choose your color carefully according to your natural hair color.; , Pick one to three colors in a similar shade. Pay attention to the shade of your skin, working with colors that are cool or warm, depending upon your skin's natural color. Make sure you are using the same brand of dyes, to avoid timing confusion when you color.Blondes should try a deeper shade of blonde or a light brown. Most store-bought coloring advertises these shades as caramel, coffee and honey colors. Brunettes should choose rich brown and red shades. These may appear on the box as cinnamon or auburn. Brunettes with pale skin should avoid color that is too dark, as you need to compliment your skin tone. Choose gold or copper tones instead. Red heads should choose red shades. However, if your hair is dark, try golden brown or brunette tones. Black haired people should choose dark shades that are tinted with other colors.  , This is recommended by most box colorants. Test the dye by placing a drop or two of it on a small area of your skin. Wait 10 minutes to see if you have a reaction. If the skin that the dye is on or near begins to turn red or bumpy, you are allergic to the dye and should not use it.  , You do not want to wash your hair the day you plan on dyeing it. The natural oils your hair develops when it remains unwashed help to bind the dye to your hair. These oils also help your dye last longer.   Avoid conditioning your hair the day before you dye it. Conditioners disrupt the natural oils your hair produces.  , As you may have guessed, dye can really mess up a shirt, rug, or anything else it might get on besides your hair. In order to protect against dye stains, cover the ground where you will be dyeing your hair, as well as any nearby surfaces, with newspaper. You should wear an old t-shirt that you don’t mind getting stained.It is a good idea to have paper towels nearby, just in case there is a dye spill.  , Place an old towel that you don’t mind staining around your shoulders. Put latex or rubber gloves on before you mix the dye so that you don’t ruin that cute manicure you just got.Most dyeing kits come with gloves to use during the dyeing process. If your box doesn’t, you can purchase latex and rubber gloves at your local drugstore.  , In order to do this, you will need to rub vaseline along your hairline, neck, and over your ears. Vaseline helps wash away the dye after you have finished dyeing your hair.   Some dye boxes come with a conditioner made specifically for protecting your skin from the dye. If your dye comes with this, use it. You can also use lip balm instead of vaseline, but vaseline is recommended.  , The dye you purchased will have come in a box that has directions on. Follow those specific instructions for your dye. Your box should also contain a mixing bowl and brush. If it did not, a plastic bowl that you don’t mind staining will work just as well. Some dyes come with an activator. If this is the case with your dye, mix it into the dye. If you are using multiple dyes, mix them all at once to make the dyeing process more efficient.   If you do not have a dye brush or your dye box didn’t come with one, you can use a large paint brush purchased at your local art supply store. The brush should be no smaller that one and a half or two inches wide.  , Keep in mind that only some dyes need to be mixed with developer. Your dye should have come with developer. If it did not, but the box says that you need to use developer, you will have to buy it. You can purchase developer at most beauty supply stores.   If you are using dye that is much darker than your hair, you should only use 10% developer.  , To do this, use a comb with a pointed end to make the process easier. Unlike highlights that are added to the top of your head, these will go at the bottom, so you will need to pin your hair up on top of your head if it is long.It also helps to brush your hair thoroughly so that you do not have any tangles that make sectioning off the hair harder.  , They do not need to be symmetrical. It will look more natural if they are varied.For a more noticeable look, plan your lowlights close together. For a more natural look, plan your lowlights further apart. Blondes should avoid adding too many lowlights in the back of the hair, as these may not look natural, especially when they are exposed to direct sunlight.  , Doing this ensures that you are choosing the areas you have planned for each shade. Your dye kit should come with an applicator or a brush to dye your hair with.  , Place the applicator no closer than 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) away from your scalp and follow the hair to the tip. You want to evenly coat the section of hair, making sure that every inch of it is covered.   If you plan to do many small sections of lowlights, use small strips of foil to section off hair as you dye it with different colors. Place the foil under the hair. Brush the dye from root to tip and fold the foil. Keep the dye on the strands for the indicated time, then remove and rinse.  , This is called the processing time, which is when the dye binds to your hair. The box that the dye came in will tell you how long you need to leave the dye on for.  , Use a wet paper towel or washcloth with soap to do this. You don’t want to leave dye drips on your skin for two long or they may begin to dye your skin. While this is not permanent, it can last for several days.  , You can either rinse your hair in the sink or take a shower. Use cool water to wash your hair but don’t use any shampoo or normal conditioner--only use the conditioner provided in your dyeing kit. Don’t be shocked if it looks like all of the dye is running off of your head in rivulets--it’s not, but it is going to look like it. Continue rinsing your hair until you can see anymore dye going down the drain.   If post-dye conditioner did not come in your dyeing kit, purchase some at a beauty supply store. It should be a conditioner specifically made for dyed hair. Do not use normal shampoo and conditioner for at least 24 to 48 hours. If you used very temporary shampoo, dye will wash off of your hair every time you shower.  , It is best to avoid direct sunlight for at least a day after you have dyed your hair. UV rays from the sun can reduce the dyed color. The same goes for blow dryers--avoid blow drying your hair for several days after the dyeing process.  , After you have waited at least 24 hours, you can wash your hair with shampoo. However, it is highly recommended that you buy shampoo and conditioner specifically made for dyed hair. Normal shampoos can strip your hair of the dye.  , To keep your lowlights looking perfect, repeat this process every 6 to 8 weeks for short hair or every 3 months for long hair. In order to avoid the fried look that can sometimes come from hair that is dyed too often, leave your conditioner in your hair for a full five minutes while you shower.

"['consult with an attorney or small claims counselor', 'file in the county where the defendant lives', 'prepare a complaint or claim form', 'prepare your case for presentation in court', 'present your case in court', 'receive the court’s decision']",How to Take Action Against a Predatory Towing Bill4," Most parking and towing issues will involve a relatively small amount of money, probably $200 or less. Nevertheless, if you are going to file a claim in small claims court, it will help to have the advice of someone who knows the legal procedures. If you can afford it, you may want to hire an attorney. Alternatively, some small claims courts in the U.S. offer access to free legal aid counselors who could help you with you case. Ask the court clerk if such a service exists.   As one example, the small claims court for San Diego, California, provides a free legal service. You can reach the small claims adviser by telephone, Monday through Thursday, at 858-634-1777., In most U.S. states, a complaint for predatory towing needs to be filed in small claims court. You need to file your complaint in the appropriate court. Usually, this is the court in the county where the defendant resides or does business. If you have doubts, you should contact the clerk’s office where you believe you need to file and ask if you are in the right place.You can find a handy resource to the local filing rules for small claims courts in all 50 states at http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/small-claims-court-in-your-state-31016.html.  , Small claims courts will often have a simple form for you to complete, while others may require you to draft a complaint of your own. Visit the clerk’s office to find out what the local expectations are. Alternatively, you may be able to look up your local small claims court online and find copies of the required forms.When you complete the complaint or claim form, you will be expected to provide the defendant’s name and address. Use the name of the company and find out its address for its place of operation. If you know that the company has one address for its offices and a different address for its storage lot, you should be prepared with both. You will need to provide your own name and address, as plaintiff. You will need to provide a statement of your claim against the towing company. Explain all the facts that you believe support your claim that the company engaged in predatory towing. In small claims court, you are generally not responsible for providing notice. You will file your claim form with the court clerk. The clerk’s office will set a hearing date and will mail that notice to both parties.  , Think carefully about your claim against the towing company and the reasons that you think the bill should be denied. Put your strongest arguments first, followed by any supporting reasons. Consider whatever evidence you have as well, and prepare it for court.You should bring additional copies of any documents, photographs, or other items that you wish to introduce as evidence. You will need the original of any such items to provide to the court, and a copy for the defendant.  , When you arrive for your assigned hearing, you will want to arrive early. Make sure that you have all your documents, copies of parking regulations, and any other evidence you will need. When you present your case to the judge (or perhaps a clerk magistrate), you should begin with your strongest arguments first. As you go through your presentation, provide the judge with whatever evidence you have.For example, your presentation of a case related to predatory towing may look like this:   Begin by asserting that you parked in a legal location. Present the judge with photographs of the area, showing that there were no “no parking” signs. If this argument is successful, the court may find in your favor without needing any further argument from you. Argue next that you were only parked for a brief time. Even if the space was marked as “no parking,” if you were only there for a few minutes, you should not have been towed. If you have a witness who can corroborate your testimony on this point, this would be the time to have the witness testify. Challenge any inappropriate fees that the company may have charged you. Even if your car was properly towed, you may still be able to challenge the amount of the bill. If the company charged too much, took your car to a lot that was impermissibly far from the parking spot, or refused to accept reasonable payment on your part, you may be able to challenge these with copies of the bill.  , After you present your case with whatever evidence you have, the defendant will have an opportunity to present its case. After hearing from both sides, the judge will consider the matter briefly and give you a ruling on the spot. If the judge rules in your favor, particularly if the judge orders that the towing company pay you for some fine or restitution, you should get instructions either from the judge or from the court clerk about the procedure for collecting any amount that may be due. If the order is simply a cancellation of your bill, you should get a certified copy of that order from the clerk before you leave the court.If the order is for the defendant company to pay you any amount, you will need to contact the company some time soon after your hearing to request that payment. Send a demand letter, along with a copy of the court’s order, to the company. If the company refuses to pay, you would then need to contact your local sheriff’s office, with a copy of your order, and the sheriff will help with collection.","['attorney', 'decision', 'complaint', 'court', 'county', 'small claims counselor', 'claim form', 'presentation', 'case', 'defendant']"

Tell the readers the overall achievements.   Perhaps you are writing an accomplishment report for a non-profit organization. You could summarize successes, such as the fact you organized events that benefit stakeholders, gained industry recognition, and created linkages with partners.You don’t need to bog the summary paragraph down with too many specifics. You are summarizing the key points here. You are providing the overview. Try not to make the report too long. Two pages is a good rule of thumb, unless the employer has a specific suggestion. Check with the employer to see if there is a recommended format.; , Now you need to back up the key points in the opening summary with specifics further down in the report.   Use outline form. Organize different areas into their own sections and use sub-points beneath each header. For example, perhaps one of your sections is “events organized and held.” Under such a header, you could list (with bullets or letters) a brief summary paragraph of each event held, its purpose, and how it advanced the group’s mission. Be specific here.  , Don’t just whip the report together. You want the report to look organized, in a professional font, and on nice paper.   Create a title, and center it at the top of the page. Use bold subheads to organize information. At the top of the report, provide the basics. Present the dates that are covered by the accomplishment report and the name and title of the person who prepared it., It will be a lot easier if you gather accomplishments as they happen.   Keep a journal or folder in which you track accomplishments throughout the time period of study. This will make your life a lot easier when it’s time to sit down and write.If you don’t do this, you may find yourself forgetting important accomplishments that happened toward the beginning of the time period.  , You should remind people what the goals were at the beginning of the time period being studied. What were the objectives? What are the expectations of the job? If you don’t know, get your employer to provide them.   Then, explain how those were met with actual numbers. The point is to compare what your activities or results were against original projects. For example, if you raised more money than projected, this will seem positive to investors or superiors. However, if you don’t provide the benchmark, it’s harder to assess whether it’s a success and to what degree.  , Include a few charts or graphs if you think they will help the reader visualize the data you are presenting.   Remember that some of the report readers are going to only scan it because they are probably busy. So visual aids can get your point across more effectively sometimes. Don't inundate the reader with too many graphs though. Select 1 or 2 that emphasize the key points.  , This technique helps you document your accomplishment. It stands for Challenge. Action. Results. This will help you organize your accomplishments.   Figure out the challenge of the job. Then outline the action you have taken to address it. And then document your results. For example, let's say you are a manager in a restaurant. You could write: Challenge: Lines were becoming too long during dinner rush hour, with customer complaints increasing by 10 percent. Action: Push back 1 waitress' start time by 1 hour to increase support staff during rush hour. Result: Customer complaints about wait times dropped to 2, an 80 percent decline. The key point is to be specific here. General accomplishments such as “I am a team player” aren’t as meaningful because anyone can say things like that. The key is to connect results to core issues and to demonstrate success through data and specifics., If your program involved some kind of data collection, it’s a good idea to briefly explain the methodology that you used in doing so.   Let the readers know the rationale for the chosen survey methodology. Explain the benefits and results of the survey. Why was this a credible method? For example, using the restaurant scenario, explain why it makes sense to use complaints as a methodology.Explain the survey dates and what you were trying to accomplish with the survey., To narrow down the accomplishments you want to present, think about what made you proudest during the time period. Maybe it was calming anxious visitors. Maybe it was coaching others. Don't just throw too many details at readers.Another method you can use to do this is the STAR method. This method involves briefly describing a situation and task, the action you took to accomplish it, and the results you achieved. As with the CAR method, the goal here is to link problems with results and to explain how you reached them. Focus on such things are degree of difficulty, one of a kind, first-time, high-visibility, meeting deadlines, innovation, and your work’s scope and impact. An example would be to explain that when you started as the branch manager, annual employee turnover was at 35 percent. You implemented an employee satisfaction survey, established mentorship for workers, and started a weekly staff meeting. As a result, employee turnover had dropped to 15 percent. As this example shows, the accomplishments don’t have to be excessively wordy as long as they provide the correct linkages.  , Don’t just say what your results are. You need to also explain why those accomplishments have value to your organization.   For example, let’s say you started holding staff meetings. So what? What value did that create for the organization? Think it through. If there is no concrete value, maybe you should highlight something else. If staff meetings helped increase worker morale as evidenced in a decline in sick days, which saved the employer money, then you’ve demonstrated value.  , You’re defeating the purpose of an accomplishment report if you turn in something tossed together and unprofessional.   Proofread the report for grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. Set it down for the night, and read it again in the morning. Don’t write the report at the last minute. Print out a hard copy, and check that for proofing errors. Sometimes a person’s eyes get wedding to the computer screen to the degree that they skip over obvious errors.  , If there is something that you didn’t meet expectations on, it’s better not to dodge it. Don’t make it the central focus of the report, but do address it.   Handle the areas where you didn’t do so well with positive language. For example, focus on the concrete steps that you are taking to address the issue, rather than focusing on blame or excuses. Don’t blame others in an accomplishment report. Stay focused on what you’ve done. Stay positive. Focus on the things that you or your group did well. Single out areas that you can tout.  , If you can be very specific, your responses will seem more credible. Whenever possible, back up what you say with something measurable.   Generic superlatives like “outstanding” or “dependable” aren’t very meaningful. Telling someone “I had an excellent year” is something that anyone can say. Remember this phrase: Show don’t tell. Rather than telling people you had an excellent year, show them, through details and metrics, what you did that was excellent. Instead of saying you’re good at customer relations, cite the results of customer-satisfaction surveys, letters you received and lack of customer complaints. Use numbers. Saying you handled a large staff doesn’t mean much if we don’t know how large it was. Use numbers to express the size of a budget and to outline the scope of duties.  , Do not exaggerate. Do not lie. If you’re caught doing it, you could get in big trouble.   The other problem with lying, even through obvious omission, is that you’re not going to end up being confident in the end, and you won’t be able to improve. Rather, do an honest assessment of the time period at hand, both weaknesses as well as positives. Address the weaknesses. Just find a positive way to do it.  , Many business and technical writing classes suggest that you not use the pronoun “I.” You can do this in some cases in an accomplishment report though.   For example, you may want to say “I hired 100 people.” However, don’t forget the other people who contributed to the successes. Refer to the team when applicable.

"['communicate with your partner about wants and needs', 'make small gestures of appreciation', 'flirt', 'have fun together', 'explore new sexual activities']",How to Get the Spark Back in Your Relationship2," If you feel you're in a relationship rut, chances are your partner feels the same. Sit down and have a talk with your partner about what you want and need from the relationship.   Schedule a specific time for the talk and go in prepared to listen. If you want the spark in your romance back, you have to be willing to change. Rarely is a relationship rut completely one-sided. Remain calm and listen carefully to your partner's needs and wants.Talk about the times where you feel your partner loves and cares about you. Do you feel loved when your partner brings you flowers? Asks about your day? Holds your hand during movies? Let your partner know.Talk about anything you would want to do more often. Would you like to spend more nights of the week together? Go out on more dates? Try new things together?Are there any things you used to do together that you no longer do? Early in a relationship, you may feel compelled to engage in grand romantic gestures. Sending emotional texts, bringing your partner flowers, and staying up late talking are activities that we sometimes do less of the longer we've been with someone. If you're missing these types of gestures, talk to your partner about trying to engage in them more often., Small gestures can go a long way. If you feel the spark in your relationship is lessening, consider doing some of the following:   Surprise outings, like dinner dates, concert trips, and going to museums Tell your partner one thing you like about him or her every day. For example, ""I love how you yawn in the morning"" or ""I love how the coffee's always ready because you remember to set up the pot before bed.""If your partner is busy at work, do something to make things easier when they get home. Do the dishes or laundry. Take out the trash. Cook them dinner., Flirting is a fun way to feel sexy. Oftentimes, we flirt at the beginning of a relationship to convey interest. Once mutual interest is established, flirting tends to taper off. Try to occasionally flirt with your partner via body language and verbal communication. Flirting can revitalize a relationship and increase feelings of attractiveness in both parties., Oftentimes, we forget that fun is a vital component to a romantic relationship. Try to make time for fun, romantic activities together.   Plan date nights. Oftentimes, the longer you're with someone the less you date. Try to find fun new things to do together on dates. Take a pottery class. Go dancing. Take a day hike. Visit a neighboring town.You can also reach out to others. Make plans with other couple friends. Join a club together where you can meet new people. Exploring a social life together is a great way to have fun in a relationship.Have fun at home as well. Break out board games for nights in. Find a funny television show to watch. Do Mad Libs., Your sex life is an important factor in your romantic relationship. If things are beginning to feel stale, find ways to reignite your sexual passion. You can try some of the following:Exploring new sexual positions. Watching pornography together. Role playing. Talking about sexual fantasies. Using sex toys.

Would you like to buy a sapphire that is the traditional blue, or are you looking for a sapphire in a different color? Before you go shopping, decide what size, shape, and color sapphire you’re looking for.   If you are looking for an engagement or wedding ring, make sure you have a set budget before you go shopping. If you establish a budget prior to shopping, you might be more likely to keep to it and only look at stones in your price range. Consider if you want a custom designed piece of jewelry, or if you want to buy a ready-made piece. Or, alternatively, you can purchase loose stones. If you want loose stones or a custom design, you may have to visit specific dealers that offer these services. Also, consider the preferences and desires of the person you are buying the sapphire for. If it is an engagement ring, for example, make sure you pick a sapphire that your partner will enjoy and want to wear.; , Like most precious gemstones, sapphires are priced based on color, cut, clarity, and carat size. The first measure for pricing a sapphire is its color. Lighter blue sapphires with violet or purple undertones will likely be priced the highest—around $1,000USD for a single carat stone.Sapphires come in many different colors, but each color will be accompanied by a different value and price. Sapphire value is based on the basic color of the gem as well as any secondary hues and tones that appear when light hits the stone. For example, a yellow sapphire that has green or gray undertones is less valuable than a yellow sapphire that is more pure, with white undertones, or flashes.Look for any brown or gray hues in the stone. These types of tones diminish the value of the gem. You want a sapphire that has a deep, rich saturation of one color., Sapphires traditionally come in a cushion, an oval, or rounded shape. There are a variety of other less common shapes, but you are most likely to find sapphires cut into these specific shapes while shopping.Pick a sapphire that has a cut that best shows off the luster and shine of the stone. A good cut will enhance these qualities, and appear more brilliant when it catches the light.The table of the stone, which is the flat surface across the top, should be level and smooth, and there should not be any dull areas on the stone when it moves and catches light.  , With sapphires, unlike other precious stones like diamonds, you can check the clarity with the naked eye. If you can look at the sapphire and confirm that there are no dark spots or discrepancies in the stone, it it likely very valuable.Because of the environment in which sapphires form, some “inclusions” or tiny specks from other minerals, are a normal occurrence. It’s the deep color of sapphires that helps cover or mask these slight imperfections, and still allows the stone to be considered very valuable.  , Most sapphires undergo certain treatments prior to being placed on the market. These treatments are designed to enhance color, shine, and overall appearance. Some treatments, though, can diminish the value of the stone, and undermine the integrity of the coloring and appearance.Most sapphires you buy from a jeweler likely underwent heat treatment, which is used to sharpen the color of the sapphire and eliminate blemishes and imperfections in the stone. It doesn’t substantially lower the value of the stone, though, and it is appropriate to assume that most of the stones you will find at a jewelry store underwent this process, unless it is otherwise noted.A treatment called irradiation is sometimes used on sapphires, particularly those that are yellow in color. This process can cause the stone to become easily diminished or damaged by further heat or light exposure, and it can dramatically devalue the stone. Make sure your chosen stone was not treated with irradiation. There is often a label on stones treated with this method, but even if there is not a label, ask the dealer or jeweler to provide you with that documentation., There are a good deal of synthetic sapphires on the market, and you don’t want to end up paying for a genuine stone and not receiving it. Make sure you pick a dealer that has a straightforward return and refund policy. That way, you can take the ring to be evaluated after you purchase it, and return it if it turns out to be synthetic.Ask around. If you know anyone who recently went ring or jewelry shopping, ask about their experiences with different jewelers in the area. You want to pick a jeweler you can trust and work well with, since purchasing precious gemstones is likely going to be a hefty financial investment.  , Well-known stores like Tiffany & Co. have beautiful stones and generally good reputations, but you will end up paying more just for the name and the buying experience at these stores. Try to go to a locally owned and operated jeweler to avoid these extra costs.Locally or family owned jewelers might also have more room to negotiate price with you than a big retailer. Negotiation is possible with any dealer, but with an independent dealer, you might be less likely to pay for the extra services and add-ons that name brands tack on.  , If you want something with a little more history and charm, try estate sales or auctions in the area. Make sure any sapphire you purchase from an estate sale comes with proper documentation as proof of authenticity.Even if the ring or stone comes with documentation, take it to be evaluated as a condition for purchasing it. Make sure an appraiser can verify its value before you buy it., Some jewelers are a bit slower with sales in the summer months, and might be more willing to negotiate on price at these slower times. Even if you are getting engaged and don’t plan to pop the question for a few more weeks, buying at the right time could save you a good amount on the ring of your choice.Keep an eye on sales in the area. If you plan to finance your sapphire, watch for financing specials that might include things like 0% interest, or lower monthly payments.  , Most synthetic sapphires have the same appearance and qualities of a genuine sapphire, but cost much less, and will be a lot easier to fit into a smaller budget.Rather than being naturally grown and mined, these sapphires are grown in a lab setting. They have the same basic atomic properties as a natural sapphire, but cost less and have less of an impact on the environment as a result of not requiring mining., Diamonds especially can cause some damage to the surface of your sapphire, so avoid wearing a diamond close to a sapphire, and storing them in the same pouch.To be safe, keep your sapphire in a soft, protective pouch or box when you are not using or wearing it. This will keep it away from other gemstones and environmental damage., Like many other types of precious stones, chlorinated water can be damaging to the color and surface of your sapphire. Make sure you take it off and store it in a safe place before swimming.Remove and store your ring before swimming in the ocean, as well. Getting into cold water can cause your fingers to shrink a bit, and you might be more prone to lose your ring in the water from it slipping off., Try not to use a soap that has any kind of scrubbing beads or abrasive element in it. Use the toothbrush, soap, and warm water to gently scrub the surface of your sapphire. If it is set in a ring, make sure to scrub gently around the setting.However your sapphire is set, be sure to consider that setting when cleaning. Certain metals, like gold and silver, react badly to things like ammonia. Make sure you aren’t accidentally damaging the setting of your gem.","['types', 'cut', 'market', 'research local jewelers', 'brand names', 'time', 'type', 'stone', 'gem dealers', 'lab-created sapphire', 'gemstones', 'check estate sales', 'toothbrush', 'dish soap', 'sapphire jewelry', 'clarity', 'sapphire', 'sapphires']"

So act like it. Don't slouch, shy away from her, mumble, or refuse to meet her gaze. Instead, show her that you're comfortable with yourself and she can be comfortable with you, too. Make eye contact, speak clearly, and generally act like you're confident.  , If you look as appealing as possible, you won't have to work quite so hard to convince her you're worth a kiss.   Shave. Or don't. Most girls prefer a guy with a smooth face, but some like their guy's face rough. Get to know what your girl likes. Keep some mints handy. Pop one whenever you feel your breath getting stale. Try to be as generally clean as possible. Take a shower, put on some clean clothes, and wear deodorant and if you want, a bit of cologne.  , Many girls and women will not want to make out in front of others, especially if this is her first kiss. Find the right time when you can be alone. Privacy is key.  , Watch carefully, because sometimes the signals can be confusing - she may flirt with you, then smack you on the head. These may just be coy games, or she may really be conflicted.   Ask yourself these questions: Did you and your date seem to have a cozy, warm, close time together? Has she been flirting with you through body language? Has she licked her lips, or bit her lower lip while looking at you? Has she found excuses to touch you often? If you feel confident of these things, prepare to kiss!  , If she is comfortable and doesn't look away, then she is ready. Lock eyes when you're talking to her, when she's talking, and during moments of silence.  , Starting with small physical contact tells her what's coming and gives her the chance to back out if she's uncomfortable. Try these if you're not sure what to do:   Put your arm around her shoulders Hold her hand Sweep her hair away from her face.  , Reach around her waist with one or both arms, and gently draw her toward you. If she's interested, she'll get the hint and move in; if you feel her resist, though, back off.   Do not squish her up against you and then grind your pelvis against her. Do not use a first kiss as your personal excuse to grope, grab, or get too familiar. Be a gentleman.  , Once she's close and you're pretty sure she wants to be kissed, it's time to seal the deal!   Look into her eyes. Notice how we mention eye contact twice? Very important. Let her know that you are really seeing her.  Look at her lips. Aim, dude. Make sure you know where you're going. Lean in slowly, and gently brush your lips over hers. Don't worry about fancy technique or going quickly on the first few kisses — you can deal with that later.  , Your mouth should not be overly opened or closed, and it shouldn't be mushy or too tight (relax). Don't let it go too long (more than, say, 20 seconds) or let it be too short (3 seconds is not enough) - think around 10 seconds or so. A tiny hint of tongue is nice if she seems willing, but make it flirtatious and not insistent. Check out How to Kiss for more technique tips.  , Just remain silent and hug her, ending the first kiss in a lovely, intimate moment.

"['develop a positive attitude', 'embrace change', 'problem-solve', 'learn from your mistakes', 'focus on what you can control']",How to Develop Your Resilience3," Having positive thoughts leads to positive emotions, which can increase your overall resilience.Sure, it's not easy to have a positive attitude when you broke your arm in a car accident that wasn't your fault, or when you've been rejected by the last five girls you've dated. It's a tough situation-- but that doesn't mean it's impossible. Your ability to be optimistic and to see your setbacks as isolated incidents instead of indicators of your future success is precisely what will make you succeed in the future. Tell yourself that just your positive attitude alone has the ability to help you seize more opportunities, be creative about ways to improve your life, and to feel more fulfilled overall.   Find a way to nip your negative thoughts in the bud. Any time you notice that you think or feel something negative, try to think of three positive thoughts to fight those negative ones. You know what will go a long way in helping you be more positive? Hanging out with positive people. Positive attitudes, just like negative attitudes, are infectious, so spend more time with people who see opportunity at every turn instead of whiners and complainers, and pretty soon, you'll be noticing the change within yourself. Avoid catastrophizing. Though something truly awful may have happened to you, chances are it's not the end of the world. Try to think of an alternative or more positive outcome. Focus on your past successes. What have you done well? What have you achieved? Make a list of all of the positive things you have done in your life.You may begin to see just how resilient and accomplished you already are.  , One major aspect of being more resilient is learning to deal with and accept change.Studies show that if you view the changes in your life as challenges instead of threats, you will be much more equipped to deal with them. Learning to adapt to new situations, whether it's moving to a new place or becoming a new parent, is a survival skill that will help you find creative solutions to new problems and to face adversity with relative calm and ease.Work on being open-minded. Avoid judging people for how they look, what they do, or what they believe. Not only will this help you learn something new, but being aware of a variety of perspectives can help you see the world in a new way if you're forced into an unfamiliar situation. A way to get better at embracing change is to always be trying new things, whether you're making new friends, picking up a new painting class, or reading a new genre of books. Keeping things fresh can make you less resistant to change. View change as an opportunity to grow, adapt, and transform.Change is necessary and good. Tell yourself, ""I accept this change. It can help me grow and become a stronger, more resilient, person."" If you are spiritual or religious, prayer or other traditional practices can help you accept change. Have faith that things will work out the way they are supposed to, even if they aren't exactly how you imagined them.Ask your higher power for help in accepting change.  , Part of the reason some people struggle with being resilient is because they don't know how to face their problems. If you develop a workable method of dealing with challenges, you'll be more likely to feel capable of solving them and of not feeling hopeless. Here is a helpful approach for dealing with a problem in front of you:   Understand the problem first. You may feel that you're unhappy with your job because you're not being paid enough, but if you dig deep, you may see that it's really because you feel that you aren't following your passion; this presents an entirely new set of problems than the one you thought you were faced with originally. Find more than one solution. Be creative and identify multiple solutions; if you think there's only one solution to the problem (i.e. quitting your job and trying to play in a band full-time) then you'll run into issues because your approach may not be practical, doable, or may not be able to make you happy in the long run.Make a list of all of the solutions and pick your top 2-3 candidates. Put it into action. Evaluate your solution and see how much it was able to help you succeed. Don't be afraid to get some feedback. If it didn't work out, don't look at it as a failure, but as a learning experience.  , Focus on what you can control - yourself.Another quality of resilient people is their ability to learn from their mistakes and to see them not as setbacks but as opportunities to grow.People who are resilient take the time to think about what didn't work so they can avoid running into the same kind of trouble in the future.   If you find yourself feeling depressed or anxious after rejection or failure think about how it can help you grow stronger instead. You can think something like, “What doesn’t kill me only makes me stronger.” As the saying goes, ""A clever man learns from his mistakes. A wise man knows how to avoid them."" Though you can't always avoid your first mistakes, you can gain the wisdom that will help you not to make the same ones in the future. Focus on solutions or ways to avoid the same situation in the future. Look for patterns of behavior. Maybe your last three relationships haven't failed just because of bad luck, but because you've failed to invest the necessary time into them, or because you keep trying to date the same type of person, who just may not be compatible with you in the end. Identify patterns that may be occurring so that you can begin to prevent them from re-occurring.  , Individuals who feel in control of the outcome of their lives are more resilient in the face of challenges.A person who is not resilient faces a setback and tends to think that it happened because he is somehow unworthy, that the world is unfair, and that things will always be that way.   Instead of thinking you do not have control, look at setbacks and think that they happened because of an unfortunate situation, not because it was 100% your fault or because the world is a terrible place. Focus on the option that it won't always pan out this way.Let go of things you cannot control and try to adapt.  ","['positive attitude', 'mistakes', 'change']"

It will be used to hold all of your airsoft items.; , Always get a gun with at least 350 fps for field, or 300-350 for close quarter battle (CQB). Anything lower than that would be a very cheap gun. Get a small sidearm, preferably a CO2 or green gas/propane powered handgun with a holster. Small automatic assault rifles (AEGs) can be used as a secondary weapon as well. Buy your primary weapon, preferably an AEG over 350fps for a field game, at least 300fps, but not over 350fps for CQB or a Sniper Rifle 'Over 400fps'.  , Invest in a nice pair of goggles, and wear them when playing games of airsoft. These are vital for your safety. Use a brand name for airsoft goggles.  ,, Nothing cheap that you can get at the mall for under $10.  , A major asset to airsoft games are grenades. These devices give you the upper hand during skirmishes and other tactical advances. Smoke grenades, which can be bought at your local firework stand, are usually very effective. Airsoft grenades are also effective. To make these you'll need a plastic Easter egg. Fill it with airsoft BB's and 1 M-1000 and poke a hole the top half of the Easter egg so you can stick a fuse in it. Then light it and Boom. Not all fields allow these though, and used improperly can be really dangerous.  ,, Make sure that camo matches to what type of forest or other terrain you are playing your airsoft game in. Common places to play are urban, snow. desert, and green forest.  , Always make sure you wear either a camo hat or helmet.  , Vests are vital to holding your supplies during battle.  , Look up statistics and learn how to field strip them as well. You do not want your gun to jam in the middle of a fire fight.  , If your gun is 300-350 FPS get 0.20 g bbs, and for 350-400 FPS get 0.25 g bbs. Always get 12 gram CO2 cartridges, or gas if you're using a gas blow back pistol, preferably 15 CO2 rounds and 8000 of your choice weight BB's. That should last you a couple days in FULL-DAY airsoft wars.  ,, Never wear Nike shoes or walking shoes for outdoor. Wear any type of boot that appeals to you. 5.11, Wolverine, and Timberland are good choices.  , In the event that someone falls into a thorn bush or gets cut, sanitize and cover wounds.  , Make sure it's the voltage that it is set for, because you do not want to ruin you gearbox.  ,, Before the game starts shoot your gun(s) off a couple times just to put a mental note of how far the bb travels.  , Have zip ties handy, as they a very effective role in restraining POWs (prisoners of war) when taking them hostage. A screwdriver is great for switching out parts for your gun and removing things off the rail system. The knife is great for cutting items such as zip-ties and cutting tape. Duct tape is helpful to every aspect of airsoft.  , Another great safety item are gloves. They are very useful when you need to take position in a tree and you don't want to cut your hands or you need to pick up something that you couldn't without hand protection. It is very painful to be shot on the hand, so gloves come in handy. Mechanic gloves are great and can be used in many different applications.  ,, These can be expensive and impractical, seeing as how most airsoft claymores need to be remotely set off.

"['stay calm', 'maintain focus on the objective at hand', 'train your body for the rigors of combat', 'distance yourself emotionally', 'practice often and with intensity']",How to Be a Sniper3," The vast majority of a day in the life of sniper in the field is waiting. This time, often spent alone or with one other person, is often silent and in some cases even moving can compromise your position and put you and your team at risk. It is essential to stay calm as a sniper, whether its during movement to or from an objective, while waiting to conduct reconnaissance, or in the face of the enemy.Keeping a cool head will allow you to properly utilize your training and expertise to handle the situation at hand. There are many stories of snipers being surrounded by enemies in combat situations that survived because of their ability to remain calm and concealed as the enemy passed.  , With all the waiting around one is apt to do as a sniper, it can be easy to lose sight of what you’re there to be doing. After three days of seeing nothing, your mind may begin to wander instead of remaining focused on your objective. Combat this loss of focus by frequently reminding yourself of your objectives and how important it is to your team’s safety that you stay attentive.Getting too comfortable and allowing your mind to drift is a form of complacency. Complacency kills in a combat zone, as you must always be aware of your surroundings. Mission accomplishment is, and should always be, the number one priority of a sniper.  , Although there may be hours of waiting around, being a sniper also means moments of extreme physical stress. Because of this, physical fitness is paramount for a sniper. Covering ground quickly to put you and your team in a better position to achieve your objectives, or to get to an extraction point means having the cardiovascular strength to run quickly for extended periods of time. Carrying all of the gear necessary for your mission will also require physical strength. Developing a strong body will help you to adjust to stressful combat situations, recover from injuries, and aid team members if they are injured.Snipers must be among the most physically fit combatants on the battlefield. Incorporate a good deal of running and some weight training into your workout regimen as a sniper.  , Being a sniper in a combat zone will likely mean having to make the decision to end a life. There is no universal strategy for coping with this choice, or the feelings that may arise as a result. However, distancing yourself from your target emotionally can help to lessen the emotional repercussions of killing another person in defense of your country.Chris Kyle, a highly decorated Navy sniper, often taught people to focus on the lives they were saving by engaging the enemy, rather than on the lives of the enemy that they were taking. Although you may spend a significant amount of time observing your target, it’s important not to allow yourself to become attached to them.  , Being a sniper means long periods of inaction followed by infrequent and extremely intense moments of action. It can be difficult to predict how a person may react in a firefight, but you can minimize the chances that you will make a mistake by practicing every element of your craft frequently and with the same intensity you might in an actual firefight. This includes firing your weapon, exercising and learning new skills. By practicing as though you are in a combat situation, you will be better prepared to handle one when it arises.Just like playing sports, frequent practice can help you to do the things you need to do even when the situation around you is hectic. By training how you would perform in a real scenario, you can help your body adjust to the stresses of combat ahead of time.

On Facebook on your web browser, there’s a left panel. Scroll through it until you see the Apps section. This section contains the apps on Facebook that you use and are linked to your account. Click on Bubble Witch Saga from this list, and the app will load within Facebook. Select the level you want to play and click on it.  Launch the game’s mobile app. Look for the Bubble Witch Saga app on your mobile device, and tap on it to launch it. Select the level you want to play and tap on it.; , Get to know the current level and get an idea how deep or how many bubbles you need to go through to clear the level. Know also the points needed to get at least one star. If you don’t get at least one star even if you clear the level, you will lose.  , Start playing the game by shooting the colored bubbles. Bubbles are cleared when you hit your bubbles to the same-colored bubbles at the top., The bubbles you shoot follow the path indicated by the dotted line. You will know where your bubble will land by observing the direction of the dotted line. You can also bounce the bubble off the walls to reach those hard-to-reach spaces.  , If you can, go for the gaps between bubbles and aim higher. If you’re able to clear out higher bubbles, the lower bubbles attached to them will fall off and bounce towards the jars at the bottom, giving you extra points.  , For each turn, you have two bubbles to choose from. You can swap these bubbles if you prefer to use the other one, especially if the two bubbles are of different colors.   Analyze which colored bubble you need before you shoot. Swap the bubbles by clicking or tapping the current bubble being aimed. It will be swapped with the other bubble in the cauldron.  , Do not settle with just clearing out a few bubbles. Go for huge combos by clearing out a huge collection of same-colored bubbles with one shot. You can also get some chain reactions, and you will be able to clear out the level faster and get huge points with that.  , These are the game boosters. Use these sparingly as they can cost you real money. Use these only as a last resort and when you’re confident that you can complete the level. Otherwise, it will be wiser to just restart the game.   The Magic Potions and Magic Scrolls can be equipped for use pre-game. On the pre-game window, click or tap on the Magic Potions and Magic Scrolls you want to use for your game. The costs are indicated on each of the items. Click or tap the items to purchase and equip them.  , The bubbles you shoot are limited. When the bubbles run out and you haven’t reached the goal, you will lose the game. The bubble count is clearly indicated on the middle cauldron where you get your bubbles from.  , Towards the bottom, right on top of the jars, you can find some colored spiders. These spiders give you score multipliers. If you have some bubbles that can fall off, get them to hit these spiders to give you more points.

Make sure the event report is organized into clear sections. You want to determine how the results of the event compared to the objectives for it. Summarize the main outcomes of the event. Tailor the event report for the needs and interests of each sponsor and audience. Consider the objectives of the sponsors. To some degree, sponsors are the key audience for an event report. They want to know whether it was worth sponsoring the event. So consider what they will want to know and what their hot buttons are. Tailor the event report to also meet the specific needs of the uniqueness of the event and sponsors. Don’t write a color-by-numbers report. Other audiences for the event report include senior executives and financial managers.  , You don’t want to have to rely on your memory.   Tracking key information before, during, and after the event will allow for a more specific, and ultimately more effective, report. It will also allow you to compile it all in a timelier fashion. Consider data collection to be continuous, using multiple people if necessary (including possible interns) to collect data. The bottom line is that you should not wait to create the report until the end of the event., One problem with some event reports is that they do little more than regurgitate the agenda or focus on feel-good, booster-ish statements. Don’t do that. Instead, highlight the key points with a clear, analytical eye.   Pick out some of the event highlights to discuss in detail. Consider which three things worked best, and which three points were most surprising.Avoid packing the article with mundane details, such as the luncheon menu or a detailed summary of the entire presentation of the keynote speaker. You want to pull out the things that mattered.  , The event report should include an executive summary that is a concise version of the more detailed full report. Think of the executive summary as being like an introduction. You could create two reports – an executive summary designed for people who have some interest in the event’s outcome, and a more detailed fuller report for people actually involved in setting up or sponsoring the event. In the executive summary, you want to boil down and focus on the key objects and results. The executive summary should be brief – just one or two pages. It should summarize the key elements delivered by the event, and it should include a brief interpretation of the data.  , It’s often more effective to offer a chart illustrating statistical trends, instead of just presenting readers with a bunch of numbers.   If the event included a new product, you could present a photo of it. Photos of the actual event could help illustrate the event report. Try to get photos of sponsors’ exposure on the site to document it for the report. Again, this is a task that can’t wait until after the event. Samples, reproductions, and other on-site examples are good to include. Report the number of people who received sponsor coupons, etc. Document both on-site and off-site exposure generated by the event, in the media, to the audience, for sponsors.  , You want to assess the media that was generated compared to the objectives outlined.   Focus on print ads and articles in which sponsors’ names and ads appeared, in addition to gathering circulation figures and advertising rates. Document television advertising, public service announcements, ratings and rate card values, and news coverage. Don’t forget to document radio, rate card ads, values for ads and promotions, audited reports, and so on.  , It’s really important to link the event’s objectives with its results, so make sure that you include a reminder of what the event’s original mission was and which goals were set.   You might include a listing of your event program. You should also discuss who the key participants were in the event at some point. Keep these sections brief, though. Make sure to spend the most time listing and discussing the specific key outcomes of the event and matching them to the outcomes that were listed. Be realistic, and don't try to sugarcoat things that didn't work.  , It’s important to provide a detailed discussion of the event’s budget and what was actually spent (or potentially brought in). Make sure to include a comparison of budgeted expenditures versus actual ones, as well as highlighting things that worked well and areas needing improvement.You should detail all costs, including marketing and promotional activities, staff expenses, and sponsorship costs. It’s a good idea to include a detailed budget. Financial managers and senior executives will want to see evidence that backs up conclusions. Include an accounting of revenue, such as fees, sponsorships, and exhibits. But make sure that you compare revenues to revenue projections. Compared to what? That's a good question to ask.  , You don’t want a report that’s packed with only feel-good information. The number of people who attended is one statistic you should include. It’s a good idea to provide data that has a measurable aspect to it.   Other pertinent statistics and data can include the number of sales leads generated and the number of visitors to a specific booth. Providing data gives more credibility to the event report. Provide participant/attendee information. Include demographics, attendance figures, and audience research results (such as purchasing habits). Report on the number of people who respond to sponsors’ campaigns, as well as donations to charitable organizations. Document the economic impact and employee participation.  , Your report should include some statistics, but you also need human quotes to provide contextual feedback.   Gather quotes and feedback from participants and event team members so that the assessment of the event's successes and failures doesn’t come only from the event report’s author. It will be seen as more credible. Consider including third-party research as well. Placing a value on media exposure is one example of something a third party could research. Assess the space and set ups. You should spend some time assessing the effectiveness of the location and the set ups from the vantage point of others. Discuss how space was used by the conference, event, etc.  , Try to write and publish the report pretty quickly after the event. Make sure you schedule it on your calendar to make sure that happens. Some people suggest issuing an event report within 30 days, but others say you should do it within a few days.Whatever the deadline is, make sure that you meet it. Perhaps you are writing the event report for an agency that has been commissioned by a specific client. Pay attention to all requests. The bottom line is that your audience will expect both a thorough and a timely report. So take the time to be thorough and get it right, but don’t wait so long it seems dated.  , Make sure that your event report contains proper grammar and avoid spelling, punctuation, and other proofing errors.   Make sure that your answers contain depth. A good rule of thumb is the writing technique “show, don’t tell.” That means it’s a good idea to provide some specific examples to back up more general points that are made in the report. Don’t forget your audience, and make sure that your writing sounds formal and professional. An event report is not a casual document; it’s an essential document to determine whether the event was worth it, so it needs to be authoritative.

"['time how long the cat interacts with you in a new space', 'call the cat over', 'extend your hand to the cat', 'pet the cat', 'don’t test the cat using fake appendages', 'play with the cat']",How to Assess a Cat's Personality2," Once the cat exits the carrier, reset your stopwatch and measure the time the cat spends interacting with you. Interaction is defined as sitting in your lap, rubbing against your leg, meowing or chirping at you, and looking at you. Do not encourage the cat to interact with you. Make no sound or motion apart from looking at the cat.If the cat spends less than 30 seconds interacting with you, it might be shy or afraid. If the cat interacts with you for 30-60 seconds, it has a pleasant and agreeable personality. In day-to-day activities, the cat will probably divide its time equally between playing or interacting with you and spending time in solitude. If the cat interacts with you for over 60 seconds, it has a very friendly and agreeable personality, and probably craves human attention.  , Once you’ve measured the length of the cat’s baseline level of interest in you, move to a distance of about six feet (two meters) from the cat. Crouch down. Call the cat to you in a soft and encouraging manner. Watch carefully how it interacts with you.If the cat does not make eye contact, it is more cautious and shy than a cat that does make eye contact. If the cat sniffs or nuzzles you, it is very friendly and enjoys being the center of attention. If it rolls on its back, inviting a tummy rub, it has a trusting personality. This is also a sign it is friendly and open to new experiences. If the cat watches you from a distance and does not approach, it has a relatively private personality, and prefers monitoring the situation rather than engaging with other pets or people. If the cat retreats, it has the type of personality that spooks easily and perhaps needs time to develop trust.  , Your hand should be below the cat’s head with the palm facing up. If the cat didn’t approach you when you called it, approach the cat slowly and carefully. If the cat swats at your hand, hisses, or tries to bite your hand, back away. This indicates that the cat likes being left alone and doesn’t enjoy social interaction. If the cat sniffs, licks, or nuzzles your hand, this indicates the cat is relatively outgoing and social., While talking to the cat in a gentle, reassuring manner, turn your hand over so the palm faces down. Curve your hand slightly. Place your hand on the cat’s head, then move it gently along the length of the cat’s body until you reach the mid-back. At that point, lift your hand up, then place it again on the cat’s head. Repeat the motion several times while monitoring your cat’s reaction.Cats that are fearful or hostile will bite or swat your hand away. Cats that are independent but also enjoy spending time with people will roll on their backs, meow or make another vocalization, and circle you attentively. Cats that are highly social and very outgoing will rub against your hand, encouraging you to continue petting them.  , In order to test their cat’s personality, some people like to “stroke” the cat using a hand made of rubber or plastic. However, these objects will alarm most cats, who rely on smell more than visual data to identify what is and is not dangerous., Happy and healthy cats will never pass up a chance to chase a toy. Move about three feet (one meter) away from the cat and sit on the floor. Slowly pull a piece of yarn along the floor in front of you. You could also roll a ball or use a similar cat toy. Observe the cat’s reaction.Cats that have playful and energetic personalities will watch the toy intently and chase it. They might try to snuggle against you while you move the toy about, too. Cats that are less energetic and extremely independent will ignore the toy, attend to something else, and/or not make eye contact with you.  ","['fake appendages', 'new space', 'cat', 'hand']"

You can use this information to create an effective targeted resume, so pay attention – read the entire posting carefully, and note where your skills and experience match the ad.   For example, a job posting for a marketing manager may state that the successful candidate must be able to create a marketing strategy for a new hotel. If you have experience developing and implementing new marketing strategies in the hospitality industry – and especially if you have this experience in relation to hotels – you should take note of that and plan to highlight that specific part of your background.; , As you read a job posting, take the time to highlight important duties associated with the job. When you begin to construct your targeted resume, you will be able to go back to the ad and quickly scan for this key information.  , In addition to noting key job duties, you should also highlight or underline all required and desired qualifications, including education, skills, and experience. Successful candidates will probably meet most or all of the “desired” qualifications, so these are nearly as important as “required” qualifications for creating a strategically tailored resume.   Note that although many job ads will list required and desired qualifications in formal sections, many will scatter them throughout the posting. Be sure to read the entire ad.  , In addition to the qualifications listed specifically in the advertisement, a job may also carry implied qualifications – those that you can glean from reading other parts of the ad and thinking about the position as a whole. You should plan to include implied qualifications on your targeted resume as well.   For example, a particular job posting for a marketing manager may state that a job duty is “conducting email marketing” but include nothing related to email marketing in its required or desired qualifications. You can still conclude that skills and experience in this area are desirable; these are implied qualifications that should appear on your targeted resume.  , The first and most obvious place to tailor your resume is right at the top, with your heading and summary statement. Start by including the name of the potential job in a heading immediately underneath your contact information. Enlarge the font slightly, and put the heading in bold to separate it from the rest of the information.   If you have never held a position exactly like this one, place the words “Qualifications for” just above the heading. This explains to recruiters that although you do not hold an identical job and haven’t in the past, you intend to show that you are qualified.  , Under your new heading, list a few of your most significant skills. These should be tailored to the particular job, so think carefully about the advertisement, and decide which of your qualifications seem most crucial. Separate these skills with a slash.   For example, if you are applying for a marketing manager position, you might write: “Marketing Strategy / Customer Behavior / Search Engine Optimization”  , The next part of your resume should be a summary statement: a short paragraph that highlights your relevant skills, experience, and accomplishments. The purpose of this statement is to show the recruiter that you are an ideal candidate and persuade that person to continue reading. Keep the summary statement short; if you go much longer than five sentences, recruiters may not read it. At the same time, try to include:   relevant “soft skills” like analytical thinking or interpersonal communication a basic outline of your relevant years of experience, job titles, and industries (such as “Ten years of experience as a marketing manager for the hospitality industry”) notable awards and recognition (such as “Leadership of Excellence award winner”) education and certifications key accomplishments (such as “Developed global marketing strategy that increased sales by 50%)  , Hard skills are teachable skills required to do a job successfully. These include “email marketing,” “search engine optimization,” and “software sales,” for example.  , Soft skills are personal attributes that define how you accomplish certain tasks or hard skills. They are more difficult to teach and tend to be related to individual personalities. Examples include “great communication skills,” “analytical thinking,” and “team player.”  , Your skills section should appear after your summary statement, allowing recruiters to see quickly that you are someone worth interviewing.  , List relevant hard and soft skills on a bulleted list. Keep in professional looking: use simple bullet points, dots, or dashes.   Consider using two or three columns for your skills section. Doing so keeps the section from appearing unnecessarily lengthy.  , Whenever possible, keep your description of each skill limited to one to three words: “marketing strategy,” “communication skills,” and the like.  , You need at list five to ten skills, but try not to exceed fifteen; you’ll only overload recruiters and diminish the impact of your skills section. This section will vary from job to job (and depending on your individual background), but in general, ten carefully chosen, highly important skills are ideal.  , Beginning with your most recent position, list each company, job title, and dates of employment. You do not have to include jobs that are not relevant; marketing management recruiters are unlikely to care, for example, that you delivered pizzas part time for six months, and including this kind of work will only clutter your experience section with irrelevant information.  , The short paragraph that accompanies each job listing should also be tailored: for each past position, construct two to five sentences that explain your experience and connect it to this potential job.   For example, you might write, “Manages a global team of software sales representatives. Provides quality leads to increase sales and meet team goals.”  , Consider your most outstanding accomplishments or duties that are relevant to the potential job, and list these in bullet points to make them easily readable. This is a good place to include quantifiable results as well.   For example, you might write: “Increased sales by 30% in six months through a new customer relations strategy.”  , List your formal education – a bachelor’s degree, for example – but don’t forget to consider on-the-job training or certification as well. If any training you have completed is relevant to the potential job, include it!   For example, you may have completed a leadership training program while employed at a different company. If you are applying for a supervisory position, this training is relevant.  , Even if you have no further formal education, including your high school education is unnecessary.  , No matter what job you are applying for, a bachelor’s degree is relevant. It demonstrates a certain level of education, even if the field is far removed from the potential job. If you have a B.A., include it on every resume.  , Master’s and doctoral degrees should be included only when relevant. If you are applying for a position as a marketing director and have a doctorate in marketing, include it; if you are applying for a position as a marketing director and have a doctorate in biology, consider leaving it off.  , Awards and recognition are always relevant; they demonstrate that you are able to excel and stand out among other employees. If you have awards like “Employee of the Month” or “Leadership Excellence Award,” include them, even if they do not seem directly related to the potential job.  , If you are a member of any association that is relevant to the potential job, include that on your resume. This shows that you are already committed to the field.

"['learn how to read the defcon scale', 'use defcon 5 for peacetime', 'use defcon 4 for heightened alertness', 'use defcon 3 for tense military/political situations', 'use defcon 2 for major threats', 'use defcon 1 for maximum alertness', 'understand how defcon levels are assigned', 'be aware of other us alert scales', 'research the history of the defcon scale']",How to Understand the Defcon Scale," The DEFCON scale is a way of assigning a numerical value to the readiness of the American military. Higher DEFCON values are used for lower levels of readiness (during more peaceful situations), while lower DEFCON values are used for higher levels of readiness (during tenser situations where the possibility of military action is more likely). A DEFCON level of 5 corresponds to ordinary peacetime, while a DEFCON level of 1 (which has never been reached) corresponds to the most dangerous situations, like thermonuclear war.   Note that different branches of the military can be issued different DEFCON levels. For instance, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which is generally considered one of the tensest moments in American military history, the Strategic Air Command went on DEFCON 2, while the rest of the military went on DEFCON 3., A DEFCON level of 5 is a very good thing — this is the condition used to designate normal peacetime military readiness. At a DEFCON 5, the US military takes no wide-scale precautionary defense measures beyond what is ordinarily required.   Note that DEFCON 5 isn't necessarily a sign that the world is at peace — conflicts, even major ones, may be occurring around the world during a DEFCON 5. However, in this case, the military judges that these events pose no significant defense threats.  , DEFCON 4 is the first level of readiness above the baseline value of DEFCON 5 and thus constitutes a fairly mild increase in readiness (though an increase from DEFCON 5 to DEFCON 4 is certainly significant). This DEFCON level signifies increased intelligence-gathering efforts and, sometimes, the heightening of national security measures. However, it is not usually an indication that the military (or the nation) are in imminent danger of attack.   In the modern world, it is thought that DEFCON 4 is sometimes issued after minor to moderate terrorist attacks and politically-motivated killings, or after would-be plots are uncovered. Presumably, this is done in anticipation of further violence as an attempt to prepare for and prevent it.  , Situations that call for DEFCON 3 are serious — though they may not pose an immediate threat to the existence or stability of the American state, they do call for significant vigilance. At this level, American military forces are put on a heightened state of alert in anticipation of mobilization — in particular, the Air Force is kept ready to launch operations with just 15 minutes of notice. In addition, all military communications may be encrypted based on classified protocols.   Historically, DEFCON 3 has usually corresponded to situations in which military action against the US or one of its allies was a distinct possibility. For instance, during Operation Paul Bunyan, which resulted in a DEFCON 3, two American officers were killed by North Korean forces in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). In this case, a DEFCON 3 was issued because of the possibility that any errors in the resulting standoff might trigger open war across the Korean border (a politically and militarily tense area then, as it is today)., DEFCON 2 refers to a further increase in force readiness just below maximum readiness. Combat forces are readied for major operations within just a few hours. An increase to DEFCON 2 is very serious — these situations carry a significant risk of major military operations against the United States or its allies, including the use of nuclear weapons. DEFCON 2 is typically reserved for all but the most militarily tense of international situations.   The most notable time that DEFCON 2 has ever been issued was during the Cuban Missile Crisis, although this declaration was limited to Strategic Air Command. It is though that this is the only time that a wide-scale DEFCON 2 alert has been issued, though, since DEFCON-related information is usually kept classified, it is not exactly certain how many times this level of readiness has been reached., DEFCON 1 refers to maximum military readiness — it is thought that forces with a DEFCON level of 1 are kept ready for immediate action at all times. DEFCON 1 is reserved for the absolute most dangerous, severe situations, including imminent or ongoing nuclear war involving the US or one of its allies.   Though, as noted above, DEFCON levels are usually kept classified until after the fact, it is thought that DEFCON 1 has never been issued for a branch of the US military before. Some limited, unverifiable evidence suggests that DEFCON 1 may have been triggered for certain military units during the first Gulf War.If these claims are true, however, they only applied to individual units and not to entire branches of the military.  , The exact process that the military uses to declare a DEFCON increase is not perfectly-understood by the public. It is usually assumed that an upgrade in military preparedness is made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (the highest commanders in the American military) with the approval of the president. However, some anecdotal evidence suggests that top-level military leaders are able to increase the DEFCON level without the president — for instance, some sources report that the Strategic Air Command's decision to issue a DEFCON 2 during the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred without input from President Kennedy.Note again that the precise actions that the military takes at each DEFCON level are, for obvious reasons, kept secret. Thus, most of the information that the general public has on the DEFCON scale is based on old declassified documents or historical DEFCON ""spikes"" revealed to the public after the fact. Though some non-military, non-government sources may claim to know the current DEFCON level, there is no way to verify this., The DEFCON scale is not the only measure that the US government and military use to rate their readiness against external and internal dangers. These include LERTCON (used by the US and NATO allies), REDCON (used by individual US military units), and more.However, the most important alert scale besides DEFCON is likely the EMERGCON scale. These conditions (which have never been issued before) are thought to be issued in the event of nuclear war and include civilian directives as well as military ones. EMERGCON has two levels, which are:   Defense Emergency: Made in the event of major hostile attacks against U.S. or allied forces overseas. Issued by unified commander or higher authority.Air Defense Emergency: Made in the event of attacks against the US, Canada, or military installations in Greenland. Issued by the Commander in Chief of the North American Aerospace Defense Command.Note that, by definition, all military forces go to DEFCON 1 in the event of an EMERGCON being issued.  , Though much of the DEFCON scale's history is kept secret for obvious reasons, the declassified information that is available to the public is fascinating in its own right. Conceived in the late 1950s as a means of coordinating NORAD defense efforts between the U.S. and Canada, the DEFCON system has gone through several changes between its creation and its current form today.For instance, the original DEFCON scale had ""sub-categories"" for several DEFCON levels: ""Charlie"" and ""Delta"" under DEFCON 4 and ""Alpha"" and ""Bravo"" for DEFCON 3. In addition, it had an ""Emergency"" level above DEFCON 1 that greatly resembled the EMERGCON scale described above.

"['improve your distress tolerance', 'work on accepting uncertainty', 'practice habituation', 'talk to a therapist', 'cry it out', 'call a friend']",How to Stop Worrying About Bad Things That Could Happen to You or Your Family2," Distress tolerance refers to how well you can handle uncomfortable, negative, or distressing emotions.Think about how you react when you imagine something bad happening to your family — do you panic and frantically try to stop your feelings of fear and anxiety? Do you run from the feelings or bury them? Do you do something destructive? Increasing your tolerance for these uncomfortable feelings can give you room to deal with them in a healthy way.In fact, the act of worrying can be a way of avoiding distressing emotions. If you're in your head, worrying about something bad that may happen to your family, you are actually distracting yourself from your emotions.Your worry may be a way you distract yourself from anxiety over things you can't control.Learn to self-soothe in the face of distress. When you begin to worry about your family, figure out what you can do to make the emotion more tolerable. This doesn't mean you run from the feeling, but you make it less intense so you can deal with it. Try some of the following: Exercise, dance, clean the house, listen to soothing music, look at artwork or something beautiful, play with your pet, do a puzzle or play a game, watch your favorite tv show, volunteer, take a shower or a bubble bath, pray, read a book, laugh, sing, go somewhere beautiful and calming.Start noticing the things you do that make you feel better, and the things that make you feel worse (such as binge eating, isolating yourself in your room, etc.).  , Oftentimes people think worrying is productive — if you are hyper-vigilant about everything that might happen to your family, then you might be able to protect them from anything that might harm them. Unfortunately, this doesn't work — this doesn't make life more predictable. Instead, you just waste time and energy, as you can never know with 100% certainty what will happen in life.Realize that worrying about worst-case scenarios (""What if my dad gets cancer and dies?"" ""What if my plane crashes?"") doesn't have the power to stop these things from happening.Ask yourself: Is it possible to be certain about everything in life? Does worrying constantly about something bad happening have any advantages? Does it keep me from enjoying the present moment? Can I accept that there is a small chance something bad will happen, but the actual likelihood of it happening is very low?, This means you become habituated, or grow used to, your worries. For 30 minutes you visualize what you're afraid of — your family dying in a car crash, for instance — and accept the feelings that arise instead of trying to avoid them or run away.The goal of this is to allow your anxiety to calm down and to come to a place of acceptance. It will also help you begin to distinguish between solvable problems and those over which you have no control.Ask yourself these questions, suggested by HelpGuide.org:Is the problem something I'm currently facing, rather than an imaginary what-if? If the problem is an imaginary what-if, how likely is it to happen? Is my concern realistic? Can I do something about the problem or prepare for it, or is it out of my control?   If you recognize that, no, there's nothing you can do to eliminate the chances of your family getting injured or killed in a car accident (or other worry), you can work on accepting uncertainty about the situation. Remembering: worrying is not an action. Worrying about a car accident won't somehow prevent a car accident. If you feel the problem is solvable, try to define the problem, brainstorm potential solutions, and make an action plan to start actively doing something, instead of simply worrying., Taking the steps to speak to a health care professional doesn’t need to be a last resort. Sometimes just speaking your worries about yourself or your family out loud to someone who has no connection to the problem can really help. Look for providers in your area that offer sliding scale rates, and make yourself an appointment., There is nothing like a good cry to wash away your negative emotions. Research shows that after you finish crying, your heart rate slows, your breathing slows, and you enter a state of relaxation. This relaxed state tends to last longer than the time you spent crying. So if you feel so worried about your family that you could just cry, go ahead.   Cry alone or with a friend. Make sure you're in an appropriate place (embarrassment won't help)., Friends can be an excellent source of support. They can give you their perspectives and help you to sort out yours. They can help you see if your fears about yourself or your family are rational or not. Simply by speaking your fear out loud to a real person, you may find the anxiety start to dissipate.It may help to set a ""connection goal,"" such as calling one friend per week. If you can't bring yourself to actually call, write an email instead.  ","['distress tolerance', 'practice habituation', 'uncertainty', 'friend', 'therapist']"

A Link to the Past – Inside the boss room of “Tower of Hera,” the third level of the game. Four Swords – Inside the boss room of “Tail Cave,” the first level of the game. The Wind Waker – After defeating the “Puppet Ganon” boss inside the Tower of Ganon. It will transform into a Moldorm. The Minish Cap – Can be found anywhere inside the “Fortress of Wind” level. Phantom Hourglass – Can be found anywhere inside the “Temple of Courage” level. Skyward Sword – Can be found in any dungeons within the game. A Link Between Worlds – Inside the boss room of Tower of Hera, just like in a Link to the Past version.  , Moldorms do not have any special techniques. Once these creatures spot you, they will move linearly towards you and try to ram your character. Just make a short sidestep off the monster’s path to avoid its attack.  , To kill Moldorms, all you need to do is to strike its tail three times with your sword. After you’ve dodged its attack, you should eventually end up behind the monster, giving you full access to its defenseless tail. Press the “Attack” button on your controller quickly to slash at the tail.   One other weapon you could use to kill Moldorms aside from your sword is your bow and arrow. After dodging its ram attack, or standing from a safe distance, aim your bow at its tail and fire an arrow at it. Unlike your sword, it only takes one shot of an arrow to the tail to kill Moldorms.  , Only in the Twilight Princess version do Moldorms take a different approach to kill. These creatures can be found swimming in the sands of the Gerudo Desert. Once you get in the desert, you’ll see these creatures roaming around the area, just like how sharks move around the surface of the water.; , Moldorms do not have any special techniques in this version either. Once these creatures spot you, they will slither through the sand towards you. Once they’re close enough, they’ll jump out of the sand and dive at you. Just make a short sidestep off the monster’s path to avoid its attack.  , You can’t kill these monsters while they are in the sands. That’s why as these monsters jump out of the sand to attack you, they’ll be exposing their defenseless bodies. Press the “Attack” button on your controller quickly to slash at the Moldorm’s body while it’s in mid-air. It takes three hits of your sword to the tail before a Moldorm can be killed.   Just like in other versions of the game, one other weapon you can use to kill Moldorms is your bow and arrow. While the worm is in mid-air, shoot an arrow at its body to kill it. Unlike your sword, it only takes one shot of an arrow to the body to kill Moldorms.  , If the monster won’t come out of the sand to attack you, you can use your Clawshot (which you will acquire before you even reach Gerudo Desert) to draw out the monster by force.   Simply aim your Clawshot on the moving part of the sand where the worm is swimming and press the Action button on your controller to launch it. The Clawshot will pull the Moldorm out of the sand and it will flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Use your sword or bow and arrow just like in step 3 to kill it while it’s jumping around the ground.  ","['attack moldorms', 'force moldorms', 'attacks', 'attack', 'moldorm', 'sand', 'tail']"

Tension is very obvious when you are on stage. Your voice will sound thin and wavering, and your movements will be jerky and unattractive. To avoid these stiff and nervous displays when you're acting, it is essential to remain as relaxed as possible. Even a scene involving high drama calls for measured and calm concentration from the actor. So, act dramatic, but be calm inside, and don't work yourself up.  , It could be another actor, a prop, etc. Keep yourself in the moment and never stare off into space. It is obvious to the audience if you are spacing out, and it is very distracting. Keeping in the moment enables you to remain in character and enhances the believability of the role and the play itself. In real life, we tend to look at the eyes of the people we're speaking with (or listening to), so doing that on stage will appear quite natural., Just look at the back of the theater or your focus point if you are tense. Looking into the eyes of your fellow actors can be reassuring and let you feel not so ""alone"" on stage.  , Forget that you are pretending, and try to become the character you are playing. Envision how that person reacts to life, how that person dresses, walks, thinks and converses with others. Don't be afraid to act like someone else. Draw on these visualizations when portraying the character. Always stay in that state of mind when acting. If you only pretend to be sad, it's an effort; if you are sad, the result is more authentic. Don't act the character, be the character.  , While acting, you need to enunciate your words carefully (speak clearly) and project your voice farther than normal (which is not the same thing as shouting), because there are people a good distance away who are trying to understand what you're saying. All the emotions on your face should be formed in a more intense manner (but remember to stay relaxed). If you feel like you're over-acting, then you're probably acting just enough. Eyes, smile, facial expressions, gestures, etc. need to be more expansive and dramatic than you would ever make them in real life. This is often confused with exaggeration, but it really isn't. Exaggeration means making your actions and speech ""bigger."" Instead, you want better.  It's different if you're acting in front of a camera. Here you must be more subtle, as in real life. A camera picks up subtleties very easily. Broad and exaggerated movements suitable for stage acting often look ""hammed up"" on film.        , If you're performing for an audience (either live or on film), do everything you can to make the audience believe the character you're portraying. If the script says that someone is talking too much, then show a look of annoyance on your face, and perhaps accompany that with impatient tapping of your foot. If you're supposed to be near tears, blink hard, look downwards, fiddle with your clothes, and try to stare without blinking until your eyes water. Little actions are noticeable, including very expressive facial features. Employ as many of your senses as possible, such as playing music, putting on make-up, turning on some lights; anything that can make the room seem happy or sad to fit the character's mood that you are trying to display. This includes modifying your voice, which can be done by spending time with people who have an accent you want to mimic, learning a new dialect, or even getting a voice coach. There are also recordings and books to help you master an accent.  , Invest in a cheap recorder (tape, CD, flash drive). Set the recorder at a distance (start with 20 feet -- 6 meters), press record, back away, and speak a simple sentence, such as ""My shirt is blue and my eyes are, too."" Try other sentences, too. (""How now brown cow"" is a famous one). Listen to how you sound in the recording. Challenge yourself by backing farther away and repeating the words. You'll have to project your voice more each time in order to be heard clearly on the recording.  The difference between ""projecting"" and ""shouting"" is a subtle one. Essentially, projecting means to speak loudly while sounding ""normal."" In shouting, your tone of voice changes to something more strident. In projecting, you sound like you're just talking, but you can be heard at a distance.        , Breathe and alliterate. Do numerous vocal warm ups to ensure that you do not strain your vocal cords. Concentrate on enunciating your words so that your voice comes across clearly. Record yourself saying a complex sentence such as, ""Why, oh why haven't you seen those rambunctious twins, Jill and Bill?"". Try speaking this with and without emotion. Then replay the recording, listening for sounds you can enunciate more clearly. Ee-NUNN-see-ate eh-ver-ee sill-uh-bull.  Remember, however, that when you actually act, you can't do this! It's just an exercise that should be done in front of a mirror for practice. Do it enough, though, and you'll find yourself doing it automatically on stage.        , Facial expressions should be combined with simultaneous vocal inflections. Say a simple ""Oh!"" in front of a mirror. Notice both your face and your voice. Alternately portray sadness, awe, anger, fear, shock, excitement, and any other emotion you can think of.  ,   Make copies of your lines. Write or print them out, so that you can leave copies everywhere you're likely to see them. Keep a copy in your bag, your desk drawer, next to your bed, in the bathroom, at the kitchen table, on the wall, in front of a favorite window. Read your lines at every opportunity -- before you go to bed, when you wake up in the morning, waiting for a bus, cooking dinner. Recite the lines over and over, remembering to include intonation and facial expressions so that these become second nature when you perform them on stage. If you have a long passage, say the first line over and over until you are comfortable with your intonation and phrasing. Then practice the first two lines. Work repeatedly on those lines until you are ready to add the next one. And so on. (Or you can work backwards, starting with the last line, then the last two lines, etc.) Once you are comfortable with the whole passage, explore its meaning, and refine your delivery to highlight it.  , Get to know a diverse group of people. You can't possibly act like someone you've never observed. Talk to people you'd normally not think of spending time with. Think of it as research for future roles.  , It is not cheating or copying to learn from others. Watch other actors and see what they do with the parts they're given. You will learn a lot. You'll see things they do that you might incorporate into your own acting style. Just do it in a way that's unique to you. You'll develop ideas for overcoming aspects of acting that you might be finding strange or difficult. Don't be shy about asking other actors for help. Most will be more than happy to offer you advice.  , If you're less than comfortable performing before a live audience, trick yourself. When the house lights go out and the stage lights go on, you won't be able to see the audience, except for the first row or two. Just pretend you're acting for a few friends.  , Whether it be a live audience, a camera, or a close friend or relative, pretend there's a wall between you and the audience. They call this ""the fourth wall."" You're no longer on a stage or a set, you're in your private world, and the audience doesn't exist. Just remember never to turn your back on the audience.  Some plays require you to speak directly to the audience. This is called 'breaking the fourth wall."" If you are required to do this, pretend you're merely looking at them but speaking to your fellow actors on stage. It may also help to look above the audience.  , What are the cultural implications of this name? Does it suggest a specific type of acting? Does it lend a broader context to the role?   As an example, the name might suggest a kind of animal. Think about that animal, how it moves, how it feeds itself. Perhaps you could develop a characteristic action, gesture or attitude emblematic of such a creature. The best actors are good at creating unusual or attention-worthy moments.; , Would the person like to be an astronaut? An explorer? A schoolteacher?  , Take cues from the script and construct an intellectual and emotional portrait of the person you're playing. The character will stand out with this preparation. What traits might fit? Think about clothing, grooming, posture, and vocal habits.  , If s/he lives in poverty, is s/he moving into a better situation and resolving conflict, or will this character remain a poor example for others?   What is good, bad or ugly about this character? How is that expressed in choice of clothing, grooming or other personal style? What would the character say, think or dwell on? What would never be spoken? What little things lift or oppress the character's soul? Does s/he have a favorite color, decorative style, or unique habit?  , How important are the character's relationships to other people (including the audience)? If they're strong, why is this the case? If not, how do the character's behavior and attitude impact the play? What subtle or natural behaviors appeal to the audience or place the character in the audience's own experiences?

Mother Older sister Older female cousin Grandmother Aunt Female teacher Female guidance counselor Doctor or medical professional; , If your mother is not present in your life, and you have no other women with whom you feel comfortable talking, be prepared to try to have the conversation with a male figure.   You could ask your father, an uncle, your grandfather, a male teacher, or a male guidance counselor. Instead of having the conversation with this male figure, you could ask him to connect you with a female he knows who would be willing to talk with you about this, like a female coworker or neighbor.  , You likely have many questions, and you want to be sure to get all of them answered. Compile them into a list to ask during the conversation.   “How old were you when you got your first period?” “What happens during a period?” “What is a menstrual cycle?” “Does having your period hurt?” “How long does a period last?” “What do I need to do to get ready for my period?” “How will I know if I might be getting my first period?” “Why do girls and women get periods?” “Do you know of any books or websites that I can read to get even more information?” “What does it mean when you haven't gotten your period by the 'normal age?'” “What are the differences between different feminine hygiene products?”  , This is a sensitive topic for many girls and women, and it can be embarrassing and awkward to talk about getting your period. Plan out when and where you will have this conversation with your chosen trusted person.   It might be best to do it at a time when no one else is around or will be interrupting. Perhaps you could arrange it for an evening when you know other family members will be busy out of the house. Have the conversation in a place where you feel comfortable, like at home, in your guidance counselor's office, or in a doctor's office.  , It is perfectly acceptable to bring up the conversation on-the-spot, but it could be helpful to pre-arrange when it will happen.   Ask your trusted chosen person if they have some time to chat with you after dinner, after school, or at whatever time you had in mind. In the event that you plan to have the conversation with a teacher, guidance counselor, or doctor, you will likely need to schedule an appointment.  , Especially if you are trying to have this conversation with someone other than a close female family member, this person may not feel comfortable or feel that it is his/her place to talk about this with you.   “I'm hoping to talk with you about getting my period. Do you feel comfortable having that conversation with me?” “I think I might be getting close to having my first period. I feel comfortable talking to you about this, but if you don't feel comfortable, I can talk to someone else about it.”  , Once you have confirmed that your chosen trusted person is agreeable to having the conversation with you, start working your way through your list of questions.   Give him/her time to answer each question. If other questions pop into your mind as he/she is talking, do not be afraid to ask them. Be confident in asking your questions. It is completely normal and natural to have a period, and your chosen trusted adult almost certainly expects you to get yours soon, if you are within the average normal age range (10-15 years old)., Some people learn best by hearing, but other people learn by copying information onto paper. If you think you will want to be able to come back to this information someday, have a notepad with you during the talk to take notes on what you learn.  , Although the conversation might feel a little awkward, it is important to show your appreciation that he/she took the time to talk with you.   “Thank you for talking about this with me. I feel a lot more comfortable and ready for it to happen.” “Having this talk with you really helped me. I know so much more now. Thank you!” “You really helped me learn a lot about getting my period. Thanks for being willing to talk with me.”  , There are several options for feminine hygiene products, which are the items girls and women use during their periods. Decide which type(s) will be best for you with the help of your chosen trusted person.   Disposable pads Cloth pads Tampons Menstrual cups Pantiliners  , You never know when you might get your first period. Prepare yourself for it by creating an emergency period kit to carry in your backpack or in a small purse.   Keep inside it at least a couple of the feminine hygiene products listed above. Use a small makeup bag or a small plastic container to hold your supplies.  , There are certain hormonal and physical signs and symptoms of oncoming puberty. Be on the lookout for these signs so that you have a “heads up” that your period may start soon (most likely sometime within the upcoming months).Breast development Growth of pubic and armpit hair White-colored discharge from the vagina  , In addition to the hormonal changes that indicate you will soon enter puberty, most girls and women experience other symptoms that are directly related to their periods starting. PMS can happen before every period.Cramps in your abdominal/pelvic region Headaches Mood swings Tender breasts Breakouts on your skin, particularly your face  , There are medical conditions that can prevent a girl from getting her period. If you are 15-16 years old and have never had a period, you need to see a medical professional to determine what is going on with your body.Your doctor will run certain tests to determine what your body's hormones are doing. He/She will also likely ask you questions about your diet and lifestyle and will consider factors such as your height, weight, and family health history.","['types', 'doctor', 'female figure', 'pre-menstrual syndrome', 'life', 'notes', 'male figure', 'access', 'pms', 'symptoms', 'years', 'first period', 'list', 'conversation', 'supplies', 'appointment', 'period', 'person', 'he/she', 'questions', 'information', 'common signs', 'emergency period kit']"

While many more urban neighborhoods may have dual-zoned properties, homes in purely residential neighborhoods may have restrictions on home-based businesses.Pure residential zoning tends to have the most restrictions, depending on the population density of your neighborhood and its proximity to commercial zones. Many states have enacted legislation favoring home-based businesses, which often includes a broad definition of home-based businesses that qualify as ""no impact"" and therefore are exempt from any zoning restrictions. No-impact home-based businesses typically are those that add little to no additional traffic to the neighborhood, such as freelancers who rarely if ever see clients in their home.; , Even if home-based businesses are permitted under zoning regulations, there may only be certain types of businesses allowed. Typically when types of businesses are forbidden the purpose is to maintain the residential character of the neighborhood.Certain types of home-based businesses, such as daycares, also must comply with other local ordinances such as fire and health codes. Some states such as California require all local jurisdictions to allow specific types of home-based businesses such as daycares. Keep in mind that although you may be permitted to have an office in your home, zoning ordinances may prohibit specific types of business activities. For example, you may have a home office but not be able to meet clients there. This still could potentially save you money as you could meet clients in a public place such as a park or coffee shop, or explore office sharing opportunities in your area.  , The main reason neighborhoods fight the presence of businesses in residential areas is the increase in traffic as customers or clients travel to and from the business location.Residential zoning codes typically won't allow restaurants or retail stores that potentially would have customers flowing in and out throughout the day. If you have a service-based home business, such as a law firm or an insurance company, there may be zoning restrictions that control how many clients you can see in a day, the hours you can see clients in your home office, and where they must park. Your local zoning ordinance also may restrict how many employees you can have, or whether you can even have employees at all. As far as parking, zoning regulations typically prevent your clients or customers from taking spots available for residents, or clogging up the streets. You may be required to provide your own parking, for example by paving an area behind your house to accommodate the needs of your business visitors.  , Even if your business complies with all other rules and regulations, there may be restrictions on changes to your home's exterior or the posting of signs or other advertising that you must follow.For example, you may be prohibited from putting up any sign on the exterior of your home or in your yard that advertises your business to passersby. Depending on the historic value of your home or neighborhood, any renovations you make to accommodate your business activities may be required to conform with the historic quality or character of your neighborhood. Generally, you won't be allowed to conduct business activities outside, and you may be restricted from parking commercial vehicles outside or in front of your home.  , If your home is located in a neighborhood governed by a covenant or other regulations enforced by a home owner's association, you may need to seek additional permissions before you can operate your home-based business.These restrictions legally are considered ""quasi-zoning"" because even though they are created under contract law they have the same effect as zoning restrictions. Keep in mind, however, that these covenants are not subordinate to your city's zoning. Even though your business may be permitted under the city zoning laws, if it is not permitted under your housing covenant you still have to take the matter up with your homeowner's association. Since restrictions can only be changed by the applicable homeowner's association, many of which don't have the most open procedures regarding how to get permission to operate a home-based business, living in a home restricted by a covenant may pose challenges. If you have to fight your homeowner's association, your best bet is to talk to your neighbors and get them on your side. If those who would potentially be most affected by your home-based business have no problem with it, you may have an easier time getting the homeowner's association to grant you an exception.  , Many cities and states require any business operating in their jurisdiction to get a general business license. If one is required in your area, you typically must fill out an application with basic information about your business and pay an annual fee.Perhaps the easiest way to find out what permits or licenses you need to operate your home-based business is to visit the website of the U.S. Small Business Association (SBA) at sba.gov. The SBA maintains a list of the types of licenses and permits required in each state, as well as links to state and local government websites that issue the required business licenses. You also can search for your state's business agency. Additional information may be available from your state's secretary of state or department of treasury. General business licenses typically are required if your doors are open to members of the general public as potential clients or customers.  , Depending on the type of business you have, you may be required to take tests, obtain certification, or be licensed by a professional board or government agency to practice in your state.Certain professions, particularly those in the medical, legal, and financial fields, require practitioners to be licensed. Maintaining your license typically requires adhering to a code of professional conduct and taking continuing education classes each year. These licenses technically are required for any practitioner, regardless of whether your business is home-based or otherwise, but it's worth recognizing that you remain subject to these requirements and your business may be shut down if you don't comply. For example, if you decide you want to open a home-based business to provide financial advice to clients, check your state's requirements to determine what services you can legally provide and which require professional licensure. Keep in mind that professional licensure requirements may require you to maintain bonds or fiduciary accounts, and these requirements may differ depending on the size of your business and whether it's home-based or operates out of a traditional commercial space.  , If part of your business entails retail sales of products or services, you may be required to collect state and local sales tax from your customers. These requirements may differ if your business is based online.Generally, if you are required to collect sales tax, you must apply for a sales tax permit. However, even if you don't sell taxable products or services, you may still want to apply for a sales tax permit if you want to be able to buy goods at wholesale prices for use in your business. Typically you can apply for a sales tax permit online. Check the website of your state's comptroller or treasury department for information specific to your state.  , Some cities or counties require home-based businesses to apply for a home occupation permit, which basically allows you operate a business out of your home.Your city or county may divide home occupation permits into different types that require different fees and have different restrictions. Generally, a home occupation permit will be cheaper if you won't be entertaining clients or customers in your home. If you plan on having clients or customers in your home regularly, you may have to attend a zoning hearing to get special permission for your home-based business. Some cities or counties allow these types of businesses only on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, if you have to apply for a home occupation permit you must first have a general business license and a specific tax ID number for your business. Certain no-impact home-based businesses, such as freelancers who contract their services but do not receive clients in their homes, typically don't need a home-occupation permit.  , Even if you operate your business as a sole proprietorship, you can keep your business and personal finances separate by requesting an EIN for your business from the IRS.You can apply for an EIN from the IRS free of charge, so be wary of websites that will offer to obtain an EIN for you for a fee. If you apply for your EIN online through irs.gov, you will receive your number immediately after you submit answers to questions regarding your identity and the location and type of business you're operating. The IRS's online portal to apply for an EIN is available Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern time. Not only do you need an EIN to file taxes for your business, but you also may need an EIN to apply for other licenses or permits from your state or local government, such as a general business license or a home occupation permit. Keep in mind that if you are operating your business as a sole proprietor, you can use your own Social Security and may not need to get a separate EIN. However, it may still be to your advantage to get a separate EIN for your business. Talk to an accountant or certified tax professional to find out what would be best in your specific situation.  , Once you have an EIN, check with your state tax authority to find out what you need to do to register and pay business income taxes with the state each year.If you've decided to form your home-based business as a corporation or LLC, you are required to operate with the state of formation and the state in which you operate (if those are different). However, keep in mind that some states require all business entities to register, regardless of the form. So even if you're running your business as a sole proprietorship, you still want to check with your state's treasury department regarding what you need to do to register. While fees assessed vary greatly among states, expect to pay around a hundred dollars to register your business. However, if you're just registering to pay taxes, there's generally no fee for that. Keep in mind that this registration differs from getting a business license, which is issued and enforced by your city or county government.  , One of the largest deductions people with home-based businesses often have comes from the amount of your rent or mortgage that you are allowed to deduct for the portion of your home that is used for business.The area of your home is measured as a portion of the total square footage of your home, and must be used regularly, exclusively, and continuously for business. For example, if you do freelance work while sitting in bed, you would not be able to deduct the square footage of your bedroom as a home office because that room is not used exclusively for business (unless you never sleep in your bed). However, if you have a spare bedroom that you have converted into an office and you only use that room for work connected with your business, you can deduct the entire square footage of that room. You also can deduct the square footage of closets or storage sheds that you use exclusively to store business supplies or equipment. The IRS provides two methods for the home office method, the regular method and the simplified method. If you use tax preparation software, you may be able to enter information for both methods and use the one that gives you the larger deduction. With the simplified method, you simply enter the total square footage of your house and the square footage of the room or area that you use exclusively and continuously for business purposes. The deduction is a standard amount per square foot. The regular method requires you to add up your actual housing expenses per year, then divide those totals by the percentage of square footage of your home that is used for business. Housing expenses that are part of this calculation include mortgage interest, utilities, and homeowner's or renter's insurance.  , When you operate your business out of your home, it can often be difficult to completely separate office equipment or other property that you use in your business. This means you typically can only make a deduction on your taxes for the percentage of time that property was used exclusively for business purposes.The same is true for supplies you purchase for use in your business but end up using personally as well. For example, if you buy bottled water for your clients, you can deduct that cost as a business expense. However, if you keep the bottled water in your home kitchen and your family routinely drinks that water as well, you technically can only deduct the portion of the cost that is used specifically in your business. By the same token, if you maintain a separate mini-fridge in your office area and keep bottled water there for your clients and no one else ever drinks it, you can deduct the full amount.

This lessens the appearance of makeup and fine lines. Apply a layer of primer to your face using your fingers. Make sure to especially target your nose, under your eyes, your forehead, and your cheekbones.      ; , When applying foundation for photographs, you want to use a matte foundation. Matte makeup does not reflect light, making it a better choice for photography.To start, use your fingertips to dab some foundation on your cheeks, your chin, the bridge of your nose, and your forehead.         Use a makeup brush to blend the makeup into your face. Use large, circular motions as you move the brush throughout your face. Go over your face with the makeup brush a few times to make sure the foundation looks blended and smooth. Make sure to blend the foundation into your neck as well, so there is not a sharp contrast between your face and neck. Never stop blending foundation at your jawline., If you're doing an outdoor shoot, you do not need as much foundation. Natural light can make makeup appear more obvious and you may look overdone with too much foundation. Only apply foundation to areas where your skin is uneven and discolored if you'll be shooting outdoors.        , Once your basic foundation is laid down, you'll need to apply some concealer. This can help eliminate the appearance of dark circles under your eyes, and can also highlight certain areas to create a slimming affect on your face.         Use the brush that came with your concealer. Dab some concealer under your eyes. Draw a line of concealer running down the bridge of your nose. Then, add some to your chin and forehead. It may also be a good idea to add some concealer just above you lip. Use a makeup sponge to slowly dab the concealer into your face. Go slowly and keep dabbing until the concealer is blended into the rest of your makeup.  , For photos, brightening powder can help make your face light up a bit more. It can also help set your makeup and keep it from fading during a photo shoot. Using a large and fluffy makeup brush, dab a small amount of brightening powder on the areas where you applied concealer.        , Even if you don't usually contour, doing so for a photo shoot can help your face look slimmer and more defined.Use a dark stick foundation to trace your face and blend the makeup from there.         Run the foundation from your temples to your hairline. Find your cheekbone by placing your finger on your face and finding the hollow part. Place a line of foundation here. You should also place two lines of foundation running along either side of the bridge of your nose. Trace your jawline with foundation, and then add a dab to your chin. Use a sponge to dab the makeup into your face. Apply a lighter, powder-based foundation below your eyes, on your chin, and on the center of your forehead. Then, use a fluff brush to blend the light and dark makeup together. Move the brush in the direction of your cheekbones and jaw line, circling the outline of your face with the brush.  , You do not need a lot of bronzer for photos, but it's a good idea to add a light layer. This can outline your face a bit and help highlight your features. Take a small amount of bronzer and use a fluff brush to outline your face. Draw a circle around your face with the brush, applying bronzer along your jawline and forehead.        , Makeup usually photographs about two shades lighter than it actually is. Therefore, it's a good idea to choose a slightly brighter shade of blush to make your cheeks look red and healthy.Pick a bright pink shade of blush and use a fluff brush to apply to your cheeks.         Start dabbing on blush on the apples of your checks. As you dab, move the brush backwards and up slightly. After dabbing, use circular motions to blend your blush in a smooth, circular line.  , Eyebrows may look lighter in photographs, so it's a good idea to fill in your eyebrows prior to a photo shoot. You'll need a brow brush in a color that matches your natural hair color.         Take the brow brush and start at the bottom of the brow. Work upward, making short and direct strokes with the brush. Fill in gaps in hair to make your eyebrows look fuller and more pronounced. Keep going until you reach the end of your eyebrow.  , You want your eyes to look bright and defined in photos. Adding highlighter to your eyelids can help prevent them from looking sunken in. Choose a shade of highlighting eye shadow that matches your natural skin tone. Use a large eyeshadow brush to apply it to both your eyelids. Use sideways, back and forth motions to cover the entirety of your lid, as well as your brow bone.        , As with foundation, something sparkly or shimmery won't look great on camera. Stick to solid shades. Matte eye shadow works best here., You want your eyes to look defined. To create this effect, you'll want to apply a shade of eye shadow slightly darker than your skin to outline your eye. You will use a corner eye shadow brush to apply this shade to your crease and the corner of your eye.         Use a corner brush to outline the outer corner of your eye. Then, run the corner brush along your crease.Take a fluff brush and sweep it across your full eyelid in small circular motions. This will blend your corner and crease makeup with the rest of your eye., In order to make your eyes look outlined and defined, take a darker shade of eye shadow. Apply some of this shade to your corner brush. Draw a small line just underneath your lower lash line with this shade. Then, take the same shade you used in the crease. Apply this underneath the makeup you just placed on the lower lash line until it blends out into your face.This will prevent the line from looking unnaturally harsh.        , Once you've finished the main part of your eyes, you'll want to highlight your inner corners. This can prevent your eyes from looking sunken into your face. You'll want to use the same highlighter you applied to your cheeks earlier as it will match the rest of your face.         Use your fingers to dab some highlighter into the inner corners of your eyes. Take a makeup brush and make swiping motions around the corners of your eyes. This should blend your makeup out.  , Eye liner is important in photographs. It outlines your eyes so they look crisp and noticeable. You can use a skinny brush, such as a corner brush, to draw a line just above your lash line. Keep the brush very close to your lashes as you draw a thin line all across your lash line.         Black eye liner is often recommended over brown shades. Black tends to show up better on camera.  , Once you're finished with your eyeliner, add mascara. To start, take an eye lash curler. Clamp it down on your eyelashes to give them a slight arch. This will make them show up better in photos. Then, take a tube of mascara and apply it to your eyelashes.         Use slow, somewhat wiggly strokes to elongate your lashes and separate them. If any of your lashes clump, you can turn the brush on its side. Try to separate the lashes with the tip of your mascara brush.  , When it comes to lipstick, brighter tends to show up better in pictures. However, it's best to pick a shade you like. You want to feel bold and comfortable in photos and a lipstick shade you love can help bolster feelings of confidence.         As with other types of makeup, matte lipsticks work best here. Place the end of the lipstick on your lips. Slowly trace the shape of your lips with the lipstick.  , You do not want to neglect lip gloss when putting on makeup for photos. Lip gloss can help your lips look full and plump in pictures. As with the lipstick, trace the shape of your lips with a complimentary gloss.        , If you're taking a lot of pictures, your makeup may fade throughout the shoot. It's a good idea to finish off your makeup by adding a nice setting spray. Hold the spray about a foot away from your face, close your eyes, and mist your face in spray. This will keep your makeup intact.

White powder is used to dust prints on dark surfaces, and dark powder is used if the print is left on light colored surfaces. Officials use either talcum-based powders for white, or graphite-based powders for black. They also sometimes use special fluorescent powders that glow under black light, if the prints may be especially hard to dust for or are on multi-colored or multi-textured surfaces.At home, you can use either baby powder, corn starch, or cocoa powder.; , You’ll want to find a brush with very fine, very soft bristles. A makeup brush or a very small paint brush will work well. Just be sure that the bristles are soft and not stiff from rinsed in water and reused., You can use scotch tape or any other clear tape like packaging tape. Just don’t use duct tape or other colored painting tape. The tape is for picking up the print after it has been powdered., If you are going to use white powder, get black construction paper so the print contrasts with the paper and is easy to see when you put it down. If you’re using a dark powder (cocoa powder or black fingerprint powder), then plain white paper is fine., If you have microscope slides, these are perfect to use for putting a fingerprint on. If not, any smooth table, chair, appliance, wall, floor, doorknob, or faucet will do., If you want to make sure your print is even easier to see after dusting it, apply some lotion to your hands before pressing down.   Practice dusting for your own prints first, and then you can try finding ones that were left accidentally around the house., You’ll want to take just a small pinch between your thumb and forefinger and sprinkle it over the whole print, trying to get some on the whole space that you think was covered by your print. You can also blow the powder around a bit to get the print covered as well., You’ll want to be very gentle so you leave the fingerprint intact. It’s best to gently lower the brush in a circular dabbing motion than to just swipe it, because swiping may smear the print. If your print gets smeared, you may have brushed too roughly or your brush may not be soft enough. This may take some practice to get it right. You should be able to see the fingerprint clearly in the powder when you’re done., Use a big enough piece that you can leave room on the corner of the tape to keep holding it (this will make it easier to pull up). Then very carefully pull the tape up. When you lift the tape, the powdered print should be stuck to it.  , Remember, if you used white powder, use a black piece of paper to capture the print with the tape. If you used dark or black powder, use a white piece of paper., Once you have practiced finding your own intentional prints, you’re ready to look around the house for accidental prints- some may be yours but you may find other people’s too.   Good places to check are doorknobs and the sides of doors, faucets, and tables.

"['determine the price of the product', 'determine the variable costs associated with the product', 'subtract the variable cost per unit from the price', 'use the contribution margin to pay fixed costs', 'find the contribution margin ratio by dividing by the price', 'use the contribution margin for quick break-even analysis', 'use the contribution margin (and ratio) to critique a business plan', 'use the contribution margin to prioritize products']",How to Calculate Contribution Margin," The first variable you need to find for the contribution margin equation is the price the product is sold for.   Let's follow along with an example problem in this section. For the purposes of our example, let's say that we run a factory that manufactures baseballs. If we sell the baseballs at $3 apiece, we'll use $3 for our baseballs' price.; , Besides the product's cost, the only other variable we need to find to determine its contribution margin is its total variable cost. The variable costs associated with a product are those that change with the number of products made, like wages, materials, and utilities like power, water, and so on.The more products made, the greater these costs will be — because these costs vary, they're called ""variable"" costs.   For instance, in our baseball factory example, let's assume the total cost of the rubber and leather used to make the baseballs in the last month was $1500. On top of this, we paid our workers $2400 and our factory's utility bill amounted to $100, for a total of $4000 in variable costs. If the company produced 2000 baseballs in that month, then the variable cost of each baseball is (4000/2000) = $2.00. Note that, in contrast to variable costs, fixed costs are those that do not change as production volume changes. For example, the rent that our company pays on its factory building will be the same no matter how many baseballs are produced. Rent, therefore, represents a fixed cost. Fixed costs are not included in the contribution margin calculation. Other common fixed costs are buildings, machinery, patent applications, etc.Utilities might fall under both fixed and variable costs. For instance, the amount of electricity used by a store during operating hours is the same whether or not a single product is sold. But in a manufacturing plant, electricity may be a variable depending on the amount of product being manufactured. Determine whether or not you have any utilities that fall into the category of variable costs.  , When you know the variable cost and the price of a product, you're ready to find the contribution margin by simply subtracting the variable costs from the price. Your answer represents the amount of money from the sale of a single product that the company is able to use to pay fixed costs and generate profit.   In our example, it's easy to find the contribution margin of each baseball. Simply subtract the variable costs per ball ($2.00) from the price per ball ($3.00) to get (3 - 2) = $1.00. Note that in real life, the contribution margin can be found on a business's income statement, a document companies publish for investors and the IRS, A positive contribution margin is almost always a good thing - the product recoups its own variable costs and contributes (hence ""contributing"" margin) a certain amount towards the fixed costs. Since the fixed costs don't increase with the amount of product produced, once they're paid off, the contributing margin from the remaining products sold becomes pure profit.   In our example, each baseball has a contribution margin of $1.00. If the rent at the factory is $1500 and there aren't any other fixed costs, 1,500 baseballs need to be sold per month to recoup the fixed costs. After this point, each baseball sold produces $1.00 of profit.  , Once you find the contribution margin for a certain product, you can use it to perform a few basic financial analysis tasks. For instance, you can find the contribution margin ratio, a related value, by simply dividing the contribution margin by the price of the product. This represents the portion of each sale that makes up the contribution margin — in other words, the portion that's used for fixed costs and profit.In our example above, the contribution margin per baseball was $1.00 and the price was $3.00. In this case, the contribution margin ratio was 1/3 = 0.33 = 33%. 33% of each sale goes towards paying fixed costs and making profit. Note that you can also find the contribution margin ratio for more than one product by dividing the total contribution margin for the products by the total price of the products.  , In simplified business scenarios, if you know the contribution margin of a company's product and the fixed costs of the company, you can quickly estimate whether the company is profitable or not. Assuming the company isn't selling the product at a loss, all it needs to do to generate a profit is to sell enough products to pay for its fixed costs — the products already pay for their own variable costs. If enough products are sold to cover the fixed costs, the company begins to turn a profit.For instance, let's say that our baseball company has fixed costs of $2,000, rather than the $1,500 given above. If we still sell the same number of baseballs, we'll generate $1.00 × 1,500 = $1,500. This isn't enough to cover the $2,000 in fixed costs, so in this situation we're losing money.  , Contribution margins can also be used to help make decisions about the way a business is run. This is particularly true if the business isn't making a profit. In this case, you can use your contribution margin to help set new sales goals or alternatively find a way to reduce your fixed or variable costs.   For example, the measure may be used to identify areas where expenses need to be reduced. Let's say that we've been tasked with fixing the $500 budget shortfall from the example problem above. In this case, we have several options. Since the contribution margin is $1.00 per baseball, we might try to simply sell 500 more baseballs. However, we could also try moving our operations to a building with cheaper rent, lowering our fixed costs. We might even try using more affordable materials to drive down our variable costs. For instance, if we could shave $0.50 from the manufacture of each baseball, we'd make $1.50 per ball instead of $1.00, so if we sold the same 1,500 balls, we'd make $2,250, turning a profit.  , If your company makes more than one product, the contribution margins of each product can help you decide how many of each to make. This is especially important if the products use the same materials or processes for their manufacture. In these situations, you must choose one product over the other, so you want to choose the one with as big of contribution margin as possible.For instance, let's say our factory makes footballs in addition to baseballs. Footballs are more expensive to produce at $4 per ball but sell for $8 per ball, giving a greater contribution margin of 8-4= $4.00. If the footballs and baseballs are made from the same type of leather, we'd definitely want to prioritize football production — we get four times the contributing margin compared to our baseballs' $1.00. More importantly, in this situation the footballs offer a higher contribution margin ratio of 0.50 as compared to baseballs at 0.33. This means that they are more efficient at producing revenue for the company.","['variable costs', 'critique', 'products', 'product', 'contribution margin ratio', 'fixed costs', 'contribution margin', 'variable cost', 'ratio', 'price', 'business plan', 'unit', 'quick break-even analysis']"
"['stop the activity causing the fracture', 'slow down', 'use elevation', 'use ice', 'take over-the-counter pain medications', 'increase activity slowly', 'stretch and strengthen your muscles', 'try orthotics']",How to Ease Pain Caused by a Stress Fracture1," If you haven't already, you need to stop doing the activity that caused the stress fracture in the first place. You should have some idea of what caused it, as it probably started hurting while you were doing it.Stress fractures are caused by doing the same thing over and over again. That's why you need to not do that particular activity at the moment.For instance, you may need to stop running for a little while to help your leg heal.; , You need to rest whatever bone you fractured. That means taking a break from all regular activities for that limb, not just the activity that caused the fracture.Your doctor will tell you when you can put weight on your leg again, if the fracture is in your foot or leg., Elevation means putting the injured area above your heart. At the very least, it should be off the ground if it is your leg or foot. Elevation helps cut down on pain and swelling.Try propping the limb up with a pillow.  , If you're not in a cast, which is likely, you may need to ice the injured area for the first day or two. You can apply ice up to four times a day, but make sure you don't apply it to bare skin. Always have a towel or cloth between your skin and the ice pack. With your doctor's permission, you can take off your boot to apply ice to the area, if you have one.Don't apply ice for more than 20 minutes at a time.  , You can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) for pain. The choice is up to you, though they both have advantages and disadvantages.NSAIDs are anti-inflammatory, meaning they can help reduce swelling, which can help with an injury like a fracture.On the other hand, other studies have shown that NSAIDs may not be as good when you're trying to heal a bone due to their blood thinning properties, so it may be better to take acetaminophen.The American Association of Family Physiciansrecommends acetaminophen. Do not give aspirin to children. If you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or bleeding, talk with your doctor before using these medicines., Once you start being active again, go slowly. It's important to not start the activity that caused the fracture again right off the bat because you can re-injure yourself, causing more pain.At first, it's best to choose activities that do not put weight on your injury, such as swimming or water walking., Your muscles support your bone, so they need to be strong enough to provide that support.As you heal, you need to perform stretches to lengthen the area. If you're unsure how to begin, consult with a physical therapist to learn which exercises to start with. It's best to begin slowly. Also, focus on strength training exercises, such as weightlifting, to strengthen muscles in that area. Again, it's important to begin slowly, starting with smaller weights and working your way up.In addition to strength training, stretching and aerobic exercise can help muscles re-adjust to a stressful activity.  , Certain orthotics can help reduce the stress on your foot. For instance, you can try inserts for your shoes, the kind designed to take some of the shock off your foot as you step.","['use elevation', 'orthotics', 'over-the-counter pain medications', 'muscles', 'increase activity', 'fracture', 'use ice', 'activity']"

For both safety and convenience, a digital thermometer is a better choice. The AAP also recommends using a plastic rather than a glass thermometer to avoid the possibility of breakage and injury.; , Ask your doctor which method is right for you and your child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends measuring temperatures rectally using a digital thermometer in children from newborns to 3 years old to get the most accurate reading.Apply a small amount of petroleum jelly to the anus and insert the thermometer 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) into the anus.If you use a digital thermometer for rectal temperature measuring, do not use the same thermometer to take oral readings. Label the thermometer to keep it separate., A temporal thermometer, or forehead scanner, uses infrared to measure how hot the temporal artery in the forehead is.These thermometers can be more expensive, however, so you may wish to use a regular oral or tympanic (in-ear) thermometer.   Temporal thermometers can be used in children 3 months and older., Being sick can be scary and children always want to be held. Cuddling your child on your lap will allow you to take his temperature more easily because he will be more calm and cooperative.Breastfeeding or telling stories will calm and distract the younger child. Older children can sit with their arm around you and snuggle in.  , Oral digital thermometers provide reliably accurate (close to rectal), easily taken temperatures without causing the child too much distress.For children younger than 3, consider taking your child's temperature rectally instead.Underarm, or axillary, temperatures may be up to 2 degrees lower than rectal temperatures. This is not as reliable a method as taking a temperature orally or rectally.Oral thermometer probes are to be placed under the tongue - not bitten and not clamped down with teeth - and held in place until the probe beeps or 2-3 minutes have passed.  , Tympanic digital thermometers are also convenient and reliable for taking a child’s temperature. They work by measuring the heat of the ear canal and tympanic membrane inside the ear.Pull the ear slightly down and back to allow the ear canal to open for a better reading. Insert the probe a few millimeters into the ear and pause. The tympanic reading is quick, beeps when ready, and is usually only slightly less accurate than rectal.A child with an ear infection will have a raised temperature in that ear so the thermometer should be used in the opposite ear if possible.If the ear infection is in both ears, use a different method to check your child's temperature.  , Every 4 hours, get a new temperature rating. Record these values so you can monitor rise and fall.   A normal temperature is up to 37.2C or 99F. Low grade fevers are up to 38.3C or 100.9F and the most common fever range is 38.4C (101F) to 39.7C (103.5).High grade fevers are over 39.8C (103.6F) and should be attended to by medical professionals when they do not come down with medication, or if your child seems very ill with a high fever.  , Your temperature is lowest in the morning after a night of rest and highest before bed after a day of activity and normal work of the body. Do not be alarmed if your child’s temperature rises by a degree between these two times (when still less than 39.8C or 103.6F)., A fever can quickly dehydrate children due to the sweating and increased bodywork to fight infection. Keep their bodies at full fever-fighting capacity by having them drink a lot of fluids., Watch for chills, sweating, flushing of the cheeks, and shivering. These are all normal responses as your child’s body tries to fight off infectious invaders.Your child may also complain of muscle and joint pain, which are also normal responses as the body fights off illness.  , External cooling techniques such as a lukewarm bath and sleeping with fewer blankets are good ways of keeping your child comfortable during the flushing and sweating responses to the fever. A sponge bath with lukewarm water can make your child more comfortable.Do not make the child so cold as to shiver, as this will actually increase the body’s temperature as a default.Cooling techniques encourage heat loss but do nothing to regulate the child’s internal temperature and thus are better used as comfort measures. You can use a fan in the room to improve air circulation, but don't position it so that it's blowing directly on your child., Your child may want to sleep a lot, which is a healthy response allowing the body to rest and focus on fighting the cause of the fever. Unusual grogginess and difficulty waking your child from slumber, as well as confusion, are cause for alarm and your child should be taken to medical attention at once., Fevers under 39.5C (103F) are generally not harmful in themselves. In many cases, fever is a good thing, as it is the body’s way of raising the temperature of the environment to be toxic to pathogens, bacteria, and viruses.Fever usually does not cause harm, is self-limiting, and medication is usually not needed. Fever usually lasts no more than a few days. Infants under the age of 12 weeks with a fever of 38C (100.4F) or greater should go directly to emergency.The main reason to treat a fever is to make your child more comfortable. But, if the fever is high (39.8C/103.6F or higher), you should consider treating it and seeking medical attention.  , Antipyretic (anti-fever) medications work on regulating the hypothalamus, the temperature centre in the brain. Both acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin, Advil) work well and should reduce the fever within 1.5 to 2 hours.If your feverish child is younger than 2, consult with your pediatrician before giving any medication.Do not give children aspirin (ASA, acetylsalicylic acid). Children who take aspirin can fall ill with Reye syndrome, a life-threatening illness that causes swelling of the brain and other issues.Always be sure to give the correct dosage to a child. Children do not take the same amount as adults. Dosages are based on age and weight so read the bottle carefully to determine the right dose for your child based on the bottle guidelines. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are uncertain how much to give.There is no evidence that alternating medications reduces fever any quicker; rather, it can lead to dosage errors. This practice is not recommended in children.Do not give ibuprofen to children younger than 6 months. If your child is vomiting or dehydrated, do not use ibuprofen., Take your child to a doctor if he has a high fever (over 40C or 104F) that does not come down to 38.3C (101F) to 38.9C (102F) with medication. Also take your child to the doctor if the fever lasts over 24 hours (for children younger than 2) or 3 days (for children 2 and over) or if the child becomes dehydrated.Take your child to emergency immediately if he becomes severely lethargic (drowsy), unresponsive, has trouble breathing, has a stiff neck, has a sudden rash, or becomes violently ill.  , A febrile seizure is a seizure caused by a sudden high temperature and looks like stiffening of the body, involuntary jerking movements, eyes rolling back into the head, and loss of consciousness. A febrile seizure may last 2 minutes and looks very scary but is not necessarily harmful.If your child is having a seizure, do not hold him down, try to stop him, or stick anything into his mouth. Remove his glasses and put something soft under his head if you can. Lay him on his side if possible. Let him be and move nearby furniture or sharp objects. Time the seizure and tell your doctor how long it lasted. If the seizure lasts more than 3 minutes, call an ambulance. Take your child for medical attention, even if he feels sleepy and wants to just rest at home. The doctor will want to ask questions to rule out any causes other than fever. Febrile seizures are common and do not cause brain damage or epilepsy.

Human toothpaste contains high amounts of fluoride, which is poisonous to dogs. Visit your local pet supply or pet grooming store to purchase dog toothpaste and a toothbrush. You can also make your own doggie toothpaste by mixing baking soda with water.Mix a tablespoon of hot water with two tablespoons of baking soda. To add freshness to the paste, add a pinch of cinnamon to the mix.; , Bring your dog to the bathroom, or an area away from noise and commotion, and close the door. Also, choose a space that has good lighting so you can inspect your dog’s teeth thoroughly.Bring some doggie treats with you so you can reward your dog for good behavior throughout the process.  , Get your dog accustomed to having its teeth brushed by massaging your dog’s lips with your finger, first. Massage your dog’s lips in a circular motion for 30 to 60 seconds once per day for a week.   This step is especially important if your dog has an adverse reaction to its mouth being touched. If your dog has an adverse reaction, stop what you are doing. Try again after a minute. Reward your dog with a treat for good behavior.  , The following week, move on to touching your dog’s teeth and gums with your finger. Wrap your finger in gauze. Lift and hold your dog’s upper lip. Gently rub your finger in a circular motion over your dog’s upper teeth. Do this for 30 seconds.Hold down your dog’s lower lip and apply the same circular motion to its bottom teeth for 30 seconds. Practice doing this once a day for a week. Remember to give your dog a treat for good behavior afterwards.  , Introduce the toothpaste to your dog by placing some on your finger. Let your dog smell and lick the toothpaste from your finger. By doing this, your dog will get used to the taste and texture of the toothpaste.You can do this either before or after you massage your dog’s teeth with your finger.  , Introduce the toothbrush by touching the front, side, and back teeth with the brush. Touch both top and bottom teeth with the brush. Do this for 30 seconds on both top and bottom teeth once per day for a week.Make sure to reward your dog for good behavior afterwards.  , Once your dog is familiar with the whole process, you can begin to brush its teeth. Before you start, place a dab of toothpaste on your finger and let your dog lick it off. Then, place more toothpaste on the toothbrush., At a 45-degree angle, place the toothbrush on its upper teeth while holding its lip. Massage the teeth with the toothbrush in small, circular motions, just like you practiced. The sides of the teeth that touch the lip will have the most plaque and tartar build-up. Focus on these areas. Only work on small areas at a time, lifting your dog’s lip as necessary.When removing tartar and plaque, use downward strokes for the top teeth. Hold down your dog’s bottom lip and massage the outsides of the bottom teeth in the same circular motion. Use upward strokes to remove tartar from the bottom teeth.  , Once you have cleaned the outsides of the teeth, attempt to brush the insides of the teeth. Your dog might resist. If it does, don’t fight your dog, but cease from brushing. Only small amounts of tartar accumulate on the insides of the teeth. Therefore, it is not as important as the sides of the teeth.Don’t forget to reward your dog for good behavior afterwards.  , It is recommended that you brush your dog’s teeth daily, but at least three times a week. Since smaller dogs are more likely to develop dental issues, it is recommended that you brush their teeth every day or at least five times a week.Healthy gums are pink, not cherry red or white, and show no signs of swelling or bleeding.  , Nylon, rubber, or toxin-free rawhide chew toys are also a great way to keep your dog’s teeth and gums strong and healthy. Chewing on a toy can help massage the gums and scrape away soft tartar.Reward your dog with treats that are specially formulated to keep your dog’s teeth healthy.Chew toys and soft chews should not replace regular brushing.  , Have your vet examine your dog’s teeth to rule out any existing infections or diseases. Ask your vet about the dental care your specific dog’s breed needs. Some dogs, especially smaller dogs, are more prone to dental diseases and infections, like gingivitis and gum disease. Your vet can recommend a teeth-cleaning regimen that caters to your dog’s needs.   Take your dog to the vet immediately if it is suffering from any of these symptoms: inflamed or swollen gums, loose or decayed teeth, tooth pain, i.e., pawing at the mouth, lumps in the gums, i.e., mouth tumors, or fluid filled blisters under the tongue or near the corners of the jaw, i.e, salivary cysts.","['week', 'calm time', 'inside', 'teeth', 'toys', 'brush', 'gums', 'dog toothbrush', 'toothbrush', 'lips', 'times', 'upper lip', 'vet', 'place toothpaste', 'dog', 'toothpaste', 'finger']"

It also uses essentials oils, which give off a fragrant scent. Here's what you'll need to make this simple air freshener:Small jar Scrapbook paper Baking Soda 10 to 20 drops essential oil Scissors Pen or pencil Needle; , The lid needs to have a metal ring part and a flat disk part. You will need the ring part to hold the scrapbook paper to the jar and the disk part to trace a circle. You can use any size jar you want, but a small, squat jar would be ideal. This way, you won't need to use as much baking soda; you only need a little bit of baking soda to get the full effect.   You can spray paint the metal ring part to make it match your paper and room decor.You can find scrapbook paper at an arts and crafts store. If you cannot find any scrapbook paper, try using some leftover gift wrap. You can also take a sheet of printer paper, and draw pretty designs on it with markers.  , Take the lid apart and set aside the metal ring; you will be using it later. Place the metal disk onto the back/blank side of the scrapbook paper. Use a pen or pencil to trace around the metal disk. Once you are done tracing, you can discard or recycle the metal disk. You will not need it anymore after this.   You can choose any color or pattern you want for the paper, but consider choosing something that matches the decor of your room or the season. If you cannot find a jar with a two part lid, then draw a circle onto a piece of loosely woven fabric (such as burlap) and cut it out. The circle needs to be a few inches wider than the moth of the jar., You will be using it in a moment. Discard or recycle the rest of the paper.  , How much baking soda you need will depend on the size of your jar., The more oil you add, the more fragrant your air freshener will be.You can use all one scent, or you can play around with mixing different scents such as lavender and vanilla, or mint and eucalyptus.   Lavender is great for bedrooms, because it is relaxing. Citrus is great for family rooms and kitchens because it's refreshing and energizing. Eucalyptus and mint are great for bathrooms because of how fresh they smell.  , Place the paper disk you just cut out on top of the jar. Make sure that the disk is centered and that the design is facing you. Place the metal ring on top of the paper. Twist the metal ring close. The paper disk will have replaced metal disk part. You are using a paper disk instead of a metal one for this air freshener because you will need to poke holes into it. It is easier to poke holes into paper than into metal.   If you are using fabric, place the fabric on top of the jar. Make sure that it is centered. Secure it to the neck of the jar with a piece of ribbon or a rubber band. Do not put the lid on it or you will trap the fragrance inside the jar.  , You may notice small clumps forming from the essential oil. Keep shaking the jar until those clumps disappear. If the clumps don't disappear, then take the lid off and crumble them up with a fork. Be sure to replace the lid when you are done.  , You can poke the holes randomly, or you can make a design, such as a heart, star, or spiral. The more holes you poke, the better the scent will be able to waft through.  , You can place it in any room you want. You will need to shake the jar every few days. Over time, the essential oil will get weaker, so you will need to add a few more drops when that happens.At some point, the baking soda will stop being effective because it will have absorbed all of the bad odors in the room. Plan on replacing it every one to three months.

For example, some quadratic equations can be factored, which involves rewriting them in a way that makes them easy to solve. To start, however, you'll want to have your equation in standard quadratic form: ax2 + bx + c = 0.   In this section, we'll only be dealing with quadratics that have an ""a"" variable equal to 1. If the a variable is not 1, the process is a little harder (see below.) Let's use x2 + 7x + 12 = 0 as our example equation in this section. In the next few steps, we'll factor and solve our equation.  , ""Factoring"" is just a term that means ""finding the values that multiply together to give you something else."" In this case, we're trying to break our quadratic equation down to its factors. Since the x term with the highest exponent is x2 (or, in other words, x × x), we'll start by setting up the factored form of the equation like this: (x + _)(x + _) = 0.   Note the blank spaces — in the next few steps, we'll fill these in to complete the factored equation.  , Next, list all of the numbers that can multiply together to give you the c term in your quadratic equation. These are its factors.   In our equation (x2 + 7x + 12 = 0), 12 is our c term. The numbers that can multiply to make 12 are: 1 and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4. This means the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.   , From your short list of numbers that multiply together to make your c value, pick the two that add up to make your b term. To be clear, you're not looking for factors of your b term — just two numbers that add together to make it.   In our equation (x2 + 7x + 12 = 0), our b term is 7. Our list of factors for c are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. 3 and 4 add up to 7, so these are the numbers we want. If there weren't two numbers in this list of factors that added up to 7, we would say that the equation is ""unfactorable over the integers.""Basically, for our purposes, this means that the equation can't be factored and that we'll have to use another method to find the roots.  , Now, simply fill in the blanks in the factored form of the equation you've prepared with the two numbers you just chose from the list of factors. This gives you the factored form of your original quadratic equation.   Let's fill in the blanks in the factored form of our quadratic equation: (x + 3)(x + 4) = 0.   , Now, all you need to do to find the roots of your original quadratic equation is to set the terms in each parentheses equal to 0 and solve for x. Since the terms in parentheses are multiplied by each other, if either one equals zero, the entire equation will. Thus, the roots of the equations are the x values that get each set of terms in parentheses to equal zero.   In our example, our terms in parentheses are (x + 3) and (x + 4) = 0. Setting each of these equal to zero, we get: x + 3 = 0: x = -3  x + 4 = 0: x = -4  Note that we can check these two answers exactly as we would if we had used the quadratic formula to find them.  , If the a term in a quadratic equation isn't equal to one, it gets a little harder to factor, but it can still be possible. Start by breaking the a term into its factors — because there's an x2 in the a term, both factors will contain x.   In this section, let's use 2x2 + 14x + 12 = 0 as our example equation. In this case, 2x2 is our a term. Since 2 is a prime number, its only factors are 2 and 1. This means that, for our purposes, the factors of 2x2 are 2x and x.  Note that there are cases where there are more than two factors for the a term. If we were dealing with 8x2, for instance, we'd have 8x and x plus 2x and 4x. In this case, we've have to test both to find the set that fits.  , We start to factor almost exactly as in the section above. However, this time, at least one of our x terms will have a coefficient next to it (sometimes, both will — it depends on the factors you've broken your a term into.)In our example, we would set up our equation like this: (2x + _)(x + _).   , This part is exactly the same as in the section above — you're just looking for the numbers that can multiply together to give you your c value.   In our example, since our c term is still 12, our list of factors is the same: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.   , This part is tricky — you want to pick two numbers that, when plugged in to the factored form of your equation, will give you the b term in your original quadratic equation. Keep in mind, though, that this time you won't just have two x's in the factored form of your equation — you'll have at least one x term with a coefficient.   In our example, our b term is 14x. This means we want to find two numbers from our list of c factors that, when we multiply one by 2x and the other by x, will give us a total of 14x. Let's try our factors from before: 3 and 4. 3 × 2x = 6x, 4 × x = 4x. 4x + 6x = 10x. This doesn't work, so let's flip them around. 4 × 2x = 8x, 3 × x = 3x. 8x + 3x = 11x. We don't get 14x either way, so this set of factors isn't right. Now, let's try 6 and 2. 6 × 2x = 12x, 2 × x = 2x. 12x + 2x = 14x. Success! We'll use 6 and 2 to fill in the blanks in our factored equation.  , Now, use the two factors you just found to fill in the blanks in your factored equation. Keep in mind that you need to put each in the right space so that when they multiply by the x terms you get the correct b term. After this, just set each set of parentheses equal to zero and solve as before.   In this case, our equation would be (2x + 2)(x + 6) = 0. Setting each half equal to zero, we get: 2x + 2 = 0 2x = -2 : x = -1  x + 6 = 0 : x = -6   ","['quadratic form', 'b term', 'form', 'c term', 'b', 'term', 'factors', 'c', 'equation', 'blanks', 'factored equation', 'values', 'x', 'factor', 'spaces', 'list', 'numbers']"

Only specific individuals have access to your medical records.   States vary in procedures and policy in regards to handing out medical records, as do individual hospitals. However, federal law dictates that an individual has the right to access his or her medical records, make copies, and request amendments. For the most part, only you and your doctor have the right to access your medical records.In rare cases, you might need to obtain someone else's records. You will need a direct authorization signed by the patient. If the patient is incapacitated, legal documents will be needed to waive the signature. However, protocol for requesting someone else's records is a subject of debate and confusion in the medical community. If you need someone else's medical records for any reason, discuss the issue with an attorney to figure out the procedures necessary to obtaining that information.Married couples do not have the right to one another's medical records and signed authorization is needed to obtain a spouse's records. Parents usually have access to the medical records of children under 18 but there are some exceptions. If, for example, a child is over 12 some states allow records regarding reproductive health and sexual history to remain confidential.; , To obtain your records, you need certain materials. Make sure you know you have all the necessary paperwork filled out before beginning the process of requesting records.   Your healthcare provider's Health Information Management Department (HIM) can provide you with the authorization form specific to your hospital. This will need to be filled out in full.Information included in the authorization form varies from state to state and hospital to hospital. However, most forms ask for your address, date of birth, social security number, and phone number. You will also probably have to provide the dates you received treatment, what documents you want released, and your reasons for requesting the records.Many hospitals, in order to speed up the process, allow the authorization form to be filled out online. Check if this is an option at your hospital if completing the forms online is more convenient for you.When you go in to request your records, you will need a photo ID., Fees vary from hospital to hospital, but there is specific protocol when it comes to charging for records. Be aware of this to avoid paying unlawful fees.   Hospitals do have the right to charge fees for medical records. However, these fees are limited to the costs of the labor required to obtain the records. In other words, your hospital cannot use your records to make a profit.Usually, a hospital will charge a fee based on the number of pages in your records. There is a cap as to how much this fee is that varies from state to state. In New York, it's 75 cents a page and in California it's 25. Know what the maximum price per page is in your state and make sure you're not being overcharged. You can usually find this information on the Department of Health's website.To avoid these fees, ask your doctor to send the last SOAP Note from your final visit, or if you are in the hospital, request the discharge summaries that were dictated by your physician.  , On the authorization form, you will be asked to select what kind of records you want. If you're unfamiliar with medical terminology, this can be confusing. However, for patients, the following forms are most useful for tracking medical history and transferring doctors.   Initial history and physical examination Any consultation reports conducted by specialists. Consultation reports review the patient's history, explain their medical needs, and lay out the reason another physician's advise is being requested.Operative reports, which document the details of a surgery Test results Medication lists Discharge reports, which include the dates you were dismissed from a hospital and any at home care your provider recommended, You have a variety of options when it comes to receiving your medical records. Paper copies are what is generally requested, but you can request digital copies as well. If your hospital uses electronic records system, you can get your records in the form of a CD or USB drive. You can also have your information sent through email. Figure out what is most convenient for you and then make the request., Receiving your medical records takes time. It is not a same day process and you should be aware of waiting periods.   Legally, your provider has to send you your records within 30 days of your initial request. They may be able to apply for a one time 30 day extension, but must explain the cause of this delayMost facilities will not take 30 days and, on average, the waiting time is 5 to 10 days.If you need your records because you are switching doctors or for insurance purposes, keep the waiting period in mind. Plan ahead and request your records well ahead of time., HIPAA is the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act. You should be informed of your HIPAA rights when you start treatment with a new doctor, such as when you are admitted to a hospital or when you see a doctor for the first time. In general, HIPAA gives you the right to access your medical information and keep it private. This means that you have the right to:ask for a copy of your medical records. request corrections to your medical records. be notified about how your information may be used or shared. decide how your information may be used. get a report on how your information was used. file a complaint if you think your information is not being handled properly.  , You are entitled to your medical records. This is federal law and a hospital cannot withhold records for any reason, including delinquent payment. As stated, hospitals can charge for paper but they cannot charge a searching fee. If a facility tries to refuse to release your records, or demands a hefty sum of money for their release, talk to an attorney. Refusal to release medical records is rare, but does sometimes occur. Understand this is illegal., While you are legally entitled to most medical records, a doctor has the legal right to refuse to release certain documents regarding your medical history. These documents include:   Personal notes Information regarding a minor over the age of 12, if the minor objects Any information the physician believes will cause substantial harm to you or others Information obtained from other physicians Substance abuse records or mental health records, In some cases, you might want or need certain information a doctor can legally refuse to release. If, for example, you're transferring to a specialist a doctor's personal notes and observations can provide your new physician important insight into your condition. There is an appeal process if your provider refuses to release certain records.   Regulations vary from state to state. Most states require you file a written appeal, citing your reasons for needing the information, to the Department of Health. Your provider must then submit an explanation for his or her refusal.A judge or committee decides whether or not the information should be released. If you win your appeal, your provider must legally release the documents. If you lose the appeal, the decision is final.","['information doctors', 'records', 'hipaa rights', 'fees', 'documents', 'refusal', 'request', 'medical records', 'necessary material']"

A few, such as chinahighlights.com and china-diy-travel.com, are in English.  , You can book through the websites listed in the above step. Be aware that only chinahighlights.com lists the prices in U.S. dollars (others list them in renminbi).   Purchasing in person at the station is convenient. You will pay for the ticket and receive it immediately. However, it can be clumsy if you do not speak Chinese. You can pay for the ticket directly on the website, but you cannot print out the ticket at home. You will receive an e-ticket number, but you cannot use that for boarding. The website chinahighlights.com can send the ticket to a hotel front desk or reserve it for you at the train station's ticket office.The website china-diy-travel.com will only reserve the ticket at the station., Of course, if you are taking a train during a busy travel season, you may want to arrive even earlier. During the Chinese New Year (or Spring Festival) period, some recommend that you arrive two hours in advance.Be sure of which station you are going to, as some places (like Beijing) have multiple stations. The name of the station will be clearly printed on your ticket. Consider taking the subway or a cab to reach the station you will depart from. The biggest cities have fast and efficient sudway lines, and most such lines include connections to regional transportation hubs. In smaller cities or at times of lower traffic volume, cabs are also readily available. Most cost little (at least for anyone familiar with U.S. rates). Understand that those waiting to get into the state might not be lined up. Queuing, as the British call it, is almost rare in China. Of course, its actually rare everywhere in the world except for the U.S., Canada, some portions of Europe, and a few former European colonies. Just be patient and follow the person in front of you. It may take longer but you will get there., In many stations, there will checkpoints outside of the station and another you must pass before you board.At the first gate or checkpoint, show your passport and ticket to the security guard. Proceed to the next security checkpoint. In the next step, you may be asked to pass through airport-style security checks. There's typically no need to remove your shoes or outerwear. Put all of your luggage on the conveyor belt of the x-ray inspection machine. When security signals to you (either verbally or with a hand gesture), make your way through the metal detector. You will most likely set it off, but don't worry. A security guard will use a ""wand"" and may gently pat you down. Do not forget to fetch your luggage in the other side of the conveyor belt.  , There should be several electronic screens displaying the times of arrival, departure, locations, and other information. Use the train number on your ticket (ex: FD234) to find the platform your train will depart from.   Note that most stations will only show city names in Chinese, at least on their display boards. Know the characters for the destination city or station., A series of signs near the platform doors will display boarding trains. If your train is not boarding or queuing, rest in the waiting room. When it is your time to board, a broadcast will inform you (in Chinese). Your train number will also be displayed on the screens., You cannot check luggage, so make sure you have everything. Show your ticket to the attendant so they will let you pass. Follow signs to your platform. If you do not know where the platform is and there are no signs, follow the crowd. They will not let you pass if your ticket is different, so you are clearly in the right line.  , Your ticket will have a car number marked on it. Once you reach the platform, look down. The floor usually has markings for the train cars. Be aware they may not line up when the train comes. When the train arrives, allow passengers to exit the train before you step on., These numbers may be hard to see because they are on the wall. If you are standing, find a comfortable place to stand that is out of the way. People and food carts will pass through once the train starts., If you're not sure where to get off, ask someone seated next to you or listen for announcements.

Adults can also deal with ADHD as well, and manifest the same symptoms. If you feel that your child or loved one acts differently or more out of control than normal, he may have ADHD. There are signs to look for in case you think your child or loved one may have ADHD.   Notice if he daydreams a lot, loses things a lot, forgets about things, can't keep still, is excessively talkative, takes unnecessary risks, makes careless decisions and mistakes, cannot or has trouble resisting temptation, has trouble taking turns in games, or has a problem getting along with other people. If your child or loved one has any number of these issues, you may need to have him or her checked for ADHD.; , The American Psychiatric Association (APA) publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), currently in its fifth edition, which is used by mental health professionals to diagnose mental disorders such as ADHD. It states there are three presentations of ADHD and that several symptoms must have been demonstrated by the age of 12, in more than one setting, for at least six months to qualify for a diagnosis. A diagnosis must be made by a trained professional.   Symptoms must be inappropriate for the person’s developmental level and be seen as interrupting normal functioning on the job or in social or school settings. For hyperactive-impulsive presentation, some symptoms must be seen as disruptive. Symptoms also cannot be better explained by or attributable to another mental or psychotic disorder. The DSM-5 criteria require that children 16 and under must have at least six symptoms in a category to gain the diagnosis while those 17 and older need five symptoms., There are three presentations of ADHD. One is inattentive ADHD, which has a distinct set of symptoms. People with this form of ADHD will have at least five to six of the symptoms, which present when the person:   Makes careless mistakes and is inattentive to detail in work, school, or with other activities. Has trouble paying attention during tasks or while playing. Doesn’t seem to be paying attention when someone is talking directly to him or her. Doesn’t follow through with homework, chores, or jobs and is easily sidetracked. Is organizationally challenged. Avoids tasks requiring sustained focus, such as schoolwork. Can’t keep track of or often loses keys, glasses, papers, tools, or other possessions. Is easily distracted. Is forgetful., The symptoms of this presentation have to be so significant that they are considered disruptive for them to be considered viable ADHD symptoms. The behaviors to look out for include:   Being fidgety or squirmy, such as constantly tapping the hands or feet. The child running or climbing inappropriately. The adult constantly feeling restless. Struggling to play quietly or do quiet activities. Being constantly on the go without breaks. Excessive talking. Blurting out even before questions are asked. Struggling to wait for his turn. Interrupting others or inserting himself into others’ discussions or games.Being very impatient. Saying inappropriate comments, showing emotions without restraint, or acting without regards to consequences., For combined presentations of ADHD, the individual will present with at least six symptoms of both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive ADHD. This is the most common type of ADHD that is diagnosed in children., The jury’s still out on the causes of ADHD, but it’s generally accepted that genetics play a large role, with certain DNA anomalies occurring more often in people with ADHD. In addition, studies show correlations between children with ADHD to prenatal alcohol and smoking as well as to early childhood exposure to lead.There are still studies being done to find the specific causes of ADHD, but the causes in these kinds of disorders, which present so differently in each case, can be hard to decipher., Scientific analyses show the brains of persons with ADHD are slightly different in that two structures tend to be smaller. The first, the basal ganglia, regulates the movement of muscles and signals which should be working and which should be at rest during given activities.   This can manifest through fidgeting parts of the body that should be at rest or incessantly tapping the hand, foot, or a pencil when no movement is needed., The second brain structure that is smaller than normal in a person with ADHD is the prefrontal cortex. This is the brain’s hub for conducting higher-order executive tasks, such as memory, learning, and attention regulation, and where theses tasks come together to help us function intellectually.   The prefrontal cortex influences the level of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is tied directly to the ability to focus and tends to be at lower levels in persons with ADHD. Serotonin, another neurotransmitter found in the prefrontal cortex, impacts mood, sleep, and appetite.A smaller-than-normal prefrontal cortex with lower-than-optimal dopamine and serotonin means greater struggles to focus and effectively tune out all the extraneous stimuli flooding the brain all at once. Persons with ADHD struggle to focus on a single thing at a time; the plethora of stimuli cause a high degree of distractibility as well as decreased impulse control., If individuals with ADHD fail to obtain special services that allow them to receive a quality education, they have a higher probability of ending up unemployed, homeless, or incarcerated. The government estimates that about 10% of adults with learning disabilities are unemployed, and it is likely the percentage of persons with ADHD who cannot find or retain jobs is equally high as they tend to struggle with attention, organization, and managing their time as well as social skills, all of which are considered essential characteristics by employers.While it’s hard to gauge percentages of current homeless or unemployed persons with ADHD, one study estimated that 40% of men serving long-term prison sentences may have ADHD.In addition, persons with ADHD have a greater propensity for falling into substance abuse, and it’s harder to break away from that addiction. It is estimated that almost half the individuals that have been diagnosed with ADHD self-medicate with alcohol and drugs., It’s important that parents, educators, and mental health providers find ways to guide children and adults with ADHD in overcoming their deficiencies so they can have safe, healthy, fulfilling lives. The more support an individual has, the safer he will feel. Get your child diagnosed as soon as you suspect he might have ADHD so he can begin proper treatment.   Children may grow out of some of the hyperactive symptoms, but the inattentive symptoms generally last a lifetime. The inattentive issues can cause other problems as they get older, which may need to be treated separately., In most cases, an ADHD diagnosis is challenging enough on its own. However, one out of every five people with ADHD is diagnosed with another serious disorder. These can include depression or bipolar disorder, which are common partners to ADHD. In addition, one third of children with ADHD also have a behavioral disorder, such as a conduct disorder or oppositional defiance disorder.ADHD tends to pair up with learning disabilities and anxiety, too.Depression and anxiety often manifest during high school, when pressures from home, school, and their peers intensifies. This can also make the symptoms of ADHD get worse as well.","['consequences', 'conditions', 'possible adhd behaviors', 'support', 'causes', 'inattentive symptoms', 'combined symptoms', 'adhd', 'hyperactive-impulsive symptoms', 'prefrontal cortex', 'basal ganglia', 'role']"
"['cut canvas for the seat', 'fold the full piece of canvas in half and lay it flat', 'cut along the line using sharp fabric scissors', 'hem each edge of the fabric', 'sew 1 ½” pockets on each diagonal side', 'design the canvas with fabric paint', 'drill four holes through the dowel', 'knot one end of the rope and guide it through the canvas pocket', 'thread the rope back through the other side of the canvas', 'finish threading the rope', 'hang the chair']",How to Make a Hammock Chair," Canvas seats can be made to fit any size person, or project. For a small child, 2 yards (1.8 m) of the canvas will be appropriate, while adults will need 3-4 yards of fabric to form a proper seat. Most canvas should come at a standard width of 1.75 yards.If you want a deeper chair, fold the canvas long-ways, making your cuts along the longer edges of the fabric. If you want your chair wider, cut along the short side. In general, the short-side cut makes a better chair.; , Fold the canvas in half, short-ways. Orient the folded edge to your left. Mark a point about 7 inches to the left of the top right corner and draw a light diagonal line with pencil, toward the bottom right corner. This is where you'll cut.   Again, make sure the folded edge is oriented to your left. You want to cut the unfolded side of the fabric.  , Go slowly, taking care to avoid creating a raggedy edge to work with. If you do, don't worry too much, because you can fold it over later while you're assembling and creating the edges. Open up the canvas and spread it out to work.   You should have a four-sided shape, with two angled edges of equal length, a long side and a short side. Orient the fabric so the shortest side is at the top.  , Fold each edge back half an inch, then fold it again and iron. Pin them in place, and then stitch the fold twice in two parallel lines to reinforce it. Hemming the top and bottom of the chair seat will help to prevent tearing after frequent use.   Hem the diagonal edges as well, but only once. After hemming the long and short sides, fold the diagonals that you cut earlier about a half inch, as you did the other edges. Pin, press, and sew the edge to reinforce it.  , Fold an inch and a half pocket back on each hemmed diagonal edge, then iron. Sew two reinforced lines along the hem, creating a pocket seam large enough to pull the rope through.   Reinforce your beginning and ending with back stitches. These pockets are going to be holding your weight, so they need to be secure.  , Get creative and use your fabric paint to express yourself through your hammock chair. To prevent a mess, consider placing your canvas on a large sheet of cardboard.   Consider painting both sides as you will see the back and bottom of the chair. Allow for ample dry time before proceeding to next step. You can also use printed fabric, but be sure it is upholstery weight or outdoor fabric to ensure its strength.  , Mark two holes at each end of the dowel, at 2” and 4”. Then drill through the holes using your 3/8"" bit. Sand the hole to remove any little burrs and clean up the drilling. If you like the natural wood tone, you can leave it or, you can stain the dowel if desired.  , Tie a large knot at one end of the 16’ rope, leaving about 3” of a tail beyond the knot. Using a lighter, you can also melt the end of the rope slightly to prevent fraying in the long-term.   Start threading the unknotted end through the dowel and canvas. Guide the down through the outer hole in the dowel and then up from the widest corner of one side of the canvas seat to the narrow corner at the top. Measure approximately 3 feet from your first knot, and tie another knot. Thread the rope up through the inner hole of the dowel so that the knot you just tied rests against the bottom of the dowel (the opposite side as the first knot).  , Start by threading it down through the 4” (or inside) hole on the other side of the dowel. Measure 3 feet from the loose end and tie a loose knot. This knot will rest against the bottom of the dowel. Thread the loose end of the rope down though the other canvas pocket, starting at the narrow end and emerging from the wider end.  , Guide it up through the last hole in the dowel. Measure 3” from the loose end and tie a knot, leaving a 3” tail. This knot will rest on the outside of the dowel. When finished, the knots should be positioned on the dowel.   If the two lengths of rope hanging below the dowel are not even, adjust the knots as needed before pulling them tight.  , Find the center of the rope above the dowel and tie a knot with 8” to 10” of excess above it. Attach the spring link, and then your quick link to the excess rope above the knot. Screw the hanging hook into a ceiling beam or large tree branch that can support your weight, then hang the link from it.

"['use the library analogy', 'take your client and his or her website into consideration', ""compare your client's website to a book"", 'compare finding a website to finding a book', ""compare your client's website to a missing book"", 'compare links to good book reviews']",How to Explain SEO to Clients3," A great way to help illustrate a certain concept is to use analogies. One popular analogy to explain SEO is the library analogy.Most people are familiar with how libraries work; children and teenagers often have to use libraries to obtain sources and information for their school projects and reports.  , Using your client and his or her website in your library analogy might help your client make the connections. It will also help keep him or her engaged.  , Compare your client's website to a book on a familiar subject, preferably one that has something to do with his or her website. Try to use a variation of the website's name as the title, and a variation of your client's name as the author. For example:   If your client's name is Bob McBob, and Bob's Window Cleaning is the name of his website, use Window Cleaning by Bob Windowman as your fictional book. Window cleaning is something that your client can relate to, which will help keep him engaged. While you are at it, compare your client's competitors' websites to other books in the library on the same topic. So Wendy's Windows could become a book called Wonderfully Clean Windows by Wendy Wonders.  , The two ways someone can find your client's website is by either typing the URL into the address bar directly, or by typing in keywords into the search bar of a reputable search engine. Similarly, the two ways someone can find a book in a library is by either finding the book on the shelf, or by typing keywords into the library's computer. For example:   Bob McBob specializes in cleaning windows on multistory buildings. To find his website, someone could go to a reputable search engine, and type in words such as ""window cleaning"" and ""multistory"" and the city or suburb that Bob McBob has his business in.  Window Cleaning by Bob Windowman happens to have an entire chapter on cleaning windows on multistory buildings. Someone could find his book by going to the library computer and search the catalog using the terms ""window cleaning"" and ""multistory"" or ""skyscrapers.""  , If a book is not categorized properly in the library catalog, then no one will be able to find it. Similarly, no one will be able to find your client's website unless it contains the keywords people would most likely type into a search engine while trying to find it.   A person searching for Window Cleaning by Bob Windowman won't find the book if the book is not tagged in the library catalog. A person searching for someone to clean his or her windows on a multistory house won't be able to find Bob McBob's website unless he uses keywords, such as ""window cleaning"" and ""multistory"" on his website.  , One of the reasons someone might choose a certain book over another is because it had good reviews. A well-reviewed book might even be displayed at the front section of the library on a shelf titled ""Good Reads"" or ""Top-Reviewed."" Similarly, the more websites link to your client's site, the more likely a search engine will see it as being reputable—and will place it towards the top of the search results. Your client needs to understand this. For example:   Bob Windowman knows how to write really well, which means that his book has gotten great reviews. They were so good, in fact, that the library placed the book in the front section of the library, reserved for well-reviewed books. It is placed on the Non-Fiction section of the shelf. In order to get his website to be more visible (that is, appear on the front page of the search results) Bob McBob needs to convince the search engine that his website is good. Getting linked will convince the search engine to place his website at the top, much how good reviews will convince a library to place a book in a more visible location.

"['surround yourself with mature people', 'learn new things every day', 'accept constructive criticism', 'take responsibility for your actions', 'improve your communication skills']",How to Be a Grown up and Mature Teen1," Make sure that the friends that you hang out with on a daily basis are mature teenagers. Emulate mature characteristics of the adults or role models in your life. Take note of how they interact with people and conduct themselves in public. If you surround yourself with immature people, you are more likely to act immaturely.Find a role model that has a clear set of values and qualities that you admire. You might find a positive role model in your school, religious community, after school activity, or even within your family.; , Understanding that you don’t know everything is important to becoming a mature teenager. Be receptive to learning new things. Make it a goal to learn something new each day. Learning doesn’t always have to happen in the classroom. You also learn from your parents, friends, and community members to do things like cook, drive, and manage money.Research things that you don’t know by looking it up on the internet, going to the library, or asking an expert. Ask questions while you are learning to gain a deeper understanding. Read lots of books to gain new perspective and spark your imagination. Reading is an excellent way to learn new things and gain perspective on all sorts of situations. Check out books from categories that interest you, such as sci-fi, fantasy, philosophy, nature, astronomy, and biography.  , Be open and welcome to feedback. Getting angry or defensive when you are given feedback is very childish. Actively listen and learn from the feedback that is given to you. In order to actively listen, you must listen with all of your senses instead of merely “hearing” what is being said.Accept feedback from your teachers to improve your schoolwork. For example, apply the comments on your last research paper to improve your next research paper. Receive constructive criticism from your coaches or mentors to succeed in afterschool activities. For example, apply the tips that your coach gives you during your practice to improve your technique. Ask for feedback when feedback is not initially given to you. For example, when you receive a bad grade on a paper with little feedback, consider staying after class to discuss the paper with your teacher. Say something like, “Could you give me some feedback on how to make this paper better? I would like to make a better grade on the next assignment for this class.”  , Don’t make excuses for things that you have done wrong. Resist the urge to blame other people, even if they were involved. Own up to your mistakes and learn from them. On the other hand, you should take credit for things that you have done well.Take responsibility for your grades instead of blaming them on your teachers. Admit to breaking or damaging something even if no one was watching. Accept and serve and punishments given to you at school instead of asking your parents to talk to the administration.  , As you grow up you will need to learn to communicate more effectively. Effective and mature communication is key to gain the respect that you want from other people. Remember to use your manners and treat others with respect when you are talking to them. Listen to what others are saying and don’t jump to conclusions.When possible, have important conversations face-to-face instead of by phone, text, or email. Try to communicate with someone face-to-face every day to improve your interpersonal skills and avoid isolating yourself with technology. Focus on what the speaker is telling you. Put away any distractions.  ","['actions', 'communication skills', 'mature people', 'day', 'new things', 'responsibility', 'constructive criticism']"

They aren't concerned with labels and designers, but what makes them feel attractive and sometimes quirky. Don't be afraid to wear something out of the mainstream and put it together with different accessories. Avoid expensive designers and clothing that is on trend. Don't worry too much about looking polished and perfect all the time. Do what makes you feel attractive and creative. Don't be too concerned about getting off any paint or other medium from your skin and clothes. Artists often ""wear"" their medium, whether by accident or on purpose.; , You can find interesting, entertaining, and unusual fashions at these stores. Consignment shops tend to be very affordable. Look for colors and patterns on clothing that stand out. Find unique accessories such as off the wall jewelry, a unique handbag, or one of a kind shoes.  , Vintage clothing is often one of a kind and can be re-worked into a modern look with an edge.Vintage jewelry and dresses paired with modern shoes and a unique hat can make you stand out. Men can try vintage pieces such as suits, jackets, pants, hats and shoes. Don't be afraid to try vintage pieces in unique colors and fabrics that are no longer in style. Artists often want to make a statement with what they wear.  , This can be one or two signature items that you wear anytime you go out.This can be anything from a pair of unique shoes to a specific derby hat. You can also try wearing a signature color, such as all black. You also don't have to be cautious with makeup or hairstyling. Your hair could be dyed a bright color such as orange or blue. Try vibrant makeup such as dark or bright eyeliner with a lip color that stands out.  , Place these around your home to be admired and looked at. Artists are interested in how art is changing and evolving. Coffee table books and print books are a great way to become exposed to new artists and ways of doing art. Coffee table books and art books add an air of sophistication to your living space.  , Don't be too worried about making sure it is expensive art.Buy pieces that catch the eye and provoke thought. Hang prints or original pieces on your walls throughout your home. You don't have to buy art you don't like. Stick to paintings, photos, and sculptures that please you and stir creative thinking.  , Artists often never know when they will get an idea or inspiration to work.If you have space, you could make an at home studio and keep any projects you are working on set up in this room. Keep drawings and sketches around the house that you have done, even if they aren't meant to be final projects. Save old sketch notebooks and put them in your studio. You never know how old ideas might turn into a bigger project later. Hang some of your own work in your house.  , Don't be too afraid to share your opinion on works of art.Artists can think critically. They see the details of the world around them and are affected by what they experience. Share how artwork, film, writing and everyday experiences make you feel and any ideas these aspects of life inspire. Keep current on the happenings of the art world and think critically about new artists and ideas.  , Start an Instagram account or a Tumblr.These social media apps allow you to share images with friends and viewers of your profile. Be sure to take photos of things you see and notice that make you think. This can be anything from a person or object, to an interesting pattern you see in the concrete. Tag these photos with descriptions of the ideas these images bring to mind or the feelings they evoke.  , Look in your local newspaper and on social media for information on gallery crawls, art installations, museum events etc.By being out amongst art, you will meet artists and others in the art world such as dealers and buyers. Art isn't just restricted to photography and painting. Go out and see local musicians or check out an independent film theater. Seek out multicultural events in your town or city. Being exposed to other cultures might show you ways of viewing the world you hadn't thought of. New experiences can bring you inspiration.  , This should have blank pages.Artists may be inspired by something or have an idea at the spur of a moment. If you have a notebook with you, you can sketch something quickly or write down an idea before you forget it. The mind of an artist is often constantly at work, finding sources of inspiration everywhere. Having a notebook is not only handy, but will make you look very artistic.

"['drink plenty of water', 'limit your intake of sodium', 'minimize your intake of animal protein', 'increase your citric acid consumption', 'eat a “low-oxalate” diet', 'use calcium supplements with caution', 'eat a high-fiber diet', 'watch your alcohol intake']",How to Prevent Kidney Stones2," You may have heard the “eight glasses a day” rule, but research suggests that you may actually need more than that. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men drink about 13 cups (three liters) of fluids per day. Women should drink about nine cups (2.2 liters) of fluids per day.If you’re sick or you exercise a lot, you’ll need to drink more.Water is the best choice. Drinking a half-cup of fresh-squeezed lemon juice daily raises the citrate levels in your urine, which can help reduce your risk of developing calcium kidney stones. Experts no longer recommend orange juice, as it raises oxalate levels.Be cautious with grapefruit juice, apple juice, and cranberry juice. Several studies have linked grapefruit juice to an increased risk of kidney stones, although not all studies agree.Apple and cranberry juice both contain oxalates, which are linked to the development of kidney stones. Cranberry juice may increase your risk for calcium oxalate and uric acid stones. However, it may help prevent the less-common types of stones, such as struvite and brushite stones, and it’s good for overall kidney function.Talk with your doctor about whether consuming these juices is a good idea for you.  , Consuming too much salt can cause kidney stones by increasing the calcium content of your urine. Read nutritional labels carefully and avoid processed foods, which tend to be high in sodium. Use the following sodium guidelines:Consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium daily if you are a healthy young adult. According to the US Department of Agriculture, most Americans eat far more than that recommended allowance, 3,400 mg.Restrict your sodium to 1,500 mg per day if you are at least middle aged or you have certain conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Look for “lower sodium” or “no salt added” labels on canned foods. Canned vegetables and soups often have high levels of salt. Luncheon meat, hot dogs, and frozen prepared meals often have extremely high levels of sodium, so check labels before you buy., A diet high in animal protein, especially red meats, increases your risk of developing kidney stones, especially uric acid stones.Limiting your animal protein intake to 6 ounces or less per day helps reduce your risk of forming all types of kidney stones.Red meats, organ meats, and shellfish are high in a substance called purine, which increases your body’s production of uric acid and can cause kidney stones.Eggs and fish also contain purines, although at a lower level.Substitute some of your animal protein with other rich sources of protein, such as nuts and legumes.  , Citric acid from fruits acts as a protective factor by coating existing kidney stones, making it difficult for them to increase in size. Your doctor may prescribe medications such as calcium citrate or potassium citrate; these are not dietary sources and work differently.Lemons and limes are the best source of citric acid. Drinking lemonade or limeade (especially low-sugar varieties) and squeezing lemon or lime juice on foods are excellent ways of increasing your citric acid intake. Increasing your fruit and vegetable intake will help boost your citric acid consumption. Some sodas, such as 7UP and Sprite, contain high levels of citric acid. While you should avoid high-sugar beverages, the occasional clear soda may be a good way to increase your citric acid intake., If you have a history of kidney stones made from calcium oxalate, the most common type of kidney stone, avoiding foods that are high in oxalate can help prevent future kidney stones.If you do eat foods that contain oxalates, eat them at the same time as foods that contain calcium. The calcium and oxalate will bind to each other, making them less likely to cause trouble for your kidneys.Limit oxalate to 40-50mg daily. Foods that are high in oxalate (10mg+ per serving) include nuts, most berries, wheat, figs, grapes, tangerines, beans, beets, carrots, celery, eggplant, kale, leeks, olives, okra, peppers, potatoes, spinach, sweet potato, and zucchini. Beverages that contain high levels of oxalate (more than 10mg per serving) include dark beer, black tea, chocolate-based beverages, soy beverages, and instant coffee. Don’t over consume vitamin C. Your body may turn high doses — such as those from supplements — into oxalate., The calcium you eat from foods doesn’t affect your risk of developing kidney stones. In fact, diets that are too low in calcium may cause kidney stones to develop for some people. However, calcium supplements may increase the risk of developing kidney stones, so don’t take them unless your doctor has recommended them.Children between four and eight years old should get 1,000 mg of calcium daily. Children nine to 18 years old should get 1,300 mg of calcium daily. Adults 19 and older should get at least 1,000 mg of calcium daily. Women over 50 and men over 70 should increase their intake to 1,200 mg of calcium a day., Studies suggest that fiber-rich foods may help prevent kidney stones.Many high-fiber foods contain phytate, a compound that helps prevent calcium from crystallizing.   Beans and rice bran are good sources of phytate. While wheat and soybeans also contain phytates, they are also high in oxalate, so it’s recommended that you avoid them unless recommended by your doctor.  , Alcohol increases the level of uric acid in the bloodstream, which can contribute to kidney stones.If you do drink alcohol, choose light-colored beers or wine. These beverages don’t appear to increase your risk of kidney stones.Dark beers contain oxalate, which can increase kidney stones.","['caution', 'intake', 'water', 'animal protein', 'citric acid consumption', 'alcohol intake', 'diet', 'sodium', 'use calcium supplements', 'high-fiber diet', 'drink plenty']"

People who are poisoned by tetrododoxin are fully conscious as they experience symptoms like dizziness, muscle paralysis, incoherent speech, asphyxia, and cardiac arrest.Fugu is safe to eat when it is prepared correctly by an experienced chef, but if it is prepared incorrectly, a single bite can kill a person.There is no antidote for tetrododoxin, so many people who are exposed to it die.; , If you are in Japan, you should have a relatively easy time finding a restaurant that serves fugu sashimi. It is very important, however, to ensure that the establishment has a good reputation and is licensed to serve the fish. Most incidents of fugu poisoning occur at unlicensed establishments where inexperienced chefs prepare the fugu.There are a handful of restaurants in the United States that are licensed to serve fugu sashimi, although it must be imported from Japan pre-sliced.Fugu is illegal in the European Union., In order to be legally permitted to prepare fugu, a chef must be licensed. This is meant to ensure that only the most skilled and well-trained chefs are allowed prepare this potentially deadly fish. If you plan on trying it, make sure to ask for evidence that the chef is properly licensed.To get licensed, a chef must undergo a three-year apprenticeship program and take a rigorous exam, which the majority of applicants fail. Chefs in the United States may not have this license, as they do not slice the sashimi themselves. (This is still done by a licensed individual in Japan.), The liver, ovaries, and intestines contain the highest concentrations of toxins, so these should be avoided by all except the biggest risk-takers. The meat of the fish contains very little poison, unless of course it is contaminated by the organs during preparation.Organs are sometimes served with the sashimi, but they must be specially treated to remove the toxins and are more risky to eat than the meat.The testicles are also very poisonous, but these are considered a delicacy in some areas., There are many different species of fugu, all of which are poisonous. While they are all potentially dangerous, the torafugu or tiger puffer has the least poisonous blood, which makes it the safest to eat., Some companies are raising fugu in captivity and restricting their diets to prevent them from producing their deadly poison. If you want to limit your risks when trying fugu sashimi, consider eating a farm-raised fish.Research is still being done on the safety of farm-raised fugu, so it's best to still stick with a licensed chef, even if the fish is farm-raised., While there is no antidote for tetrodotoxin, immediate medical intervention may be able to save your life if you are exposed. Doctors can use activated charcoal to absorb the poison and can also help you breathe so you don't asphyxiate from the toxin's effects.If your tongue feels numb, you need medical attention right away, as this is usually the first symptom. A slight tingling in the lips is usually okay. Other symptoms include dizziness, vomiting, and muscle paralysis.  , Fugu is an expensive dish, so expect to spend a lot on your meal. Depending on the type of dish you order, you could pay up to $200.The steep price has a lot to do with the complexity of the preparation. It's best to avoid cheap fugu from establishments that are not reputable, as it may not be safe. Some restaurants offer à la carte options if you don't want to spend too much and you only want to taste a small piece of fugu sashimi., Fugu is a mild, chewy fish. Some people find fugu sashimi bland. If you typically enjoy more flavorful fish, you may be disappointed with fugu, so consider ordering only a small amount when you first try it., Because fugu is very mild, you may want to add a little flavor. Fugu sashimi is often served with garnishes and sauce, so try eating these with the fugu for a more flavorful bite.   Your fugu may be served with radishes and scallions, which will add some wonderful flavor to the fish.Ponzu sauce is often provided with fugu sashimi dish, so try dipping the fish in this to enhance the flavor.This is a vinegar-based sauce that has a slight citrus flavor.  , The wintertime is considered the best time of year for eating fugu because the fish's bodies fatten up during this time of year. If you want to get the most out of your fugu experience, eat it during the prime season.Be aware that because it is at its best, fugu is typically more expensive during the winter., Some expert chefs purposely leave a trace amount of poison in the fugu when they prepare it. This causes a mild tingling effect in the lips, which many diners enjoy. It may also cause a sense of euphoria., If you want to have an entire fugu meal, you may want to start with a salad. Some restaurants offer options that contain fugu skin.In order for the skin to be safe to eat, the chef must remove the fish's spikes., Another popular option for consuming fugu is techiri, which is a hot broth that contains vegetables and fugu.In this dish, the taste of the fugu is hard to detect, as the broth and vegetables have stronger flavors., In addition to serving fugu raw, the Japanese also eat it cooked in a variety of dishes. Popular options include hot pots and fried dishes. Fried fugu is likely to appeal to a Western palate, as it tastes something like chicken.If you're very daring, you may want to try eating some of the more poisonous parts of the fish. For example, in some places you can find cooked fugu testicles., At some high-end restaurants, you may be able to find hot sake mixed with a spoonful of the fugu fish's testes, which are highly poisonous. More commonly, you can find hot sake that has had fugu fins steeped in it.The fugu gives the sake a savory flavor. You should let it steep for a few minutes at your table before you drink it for the best flavor.","['techiri', 'fugu', 'winter', 'daredevil', 'flavor-enhancing garnishes', 'fugu drink', 'small amount', 'advantage', 'symptoms', 'certificate', 'chef', 'toxic parts', 'poison-free variety', 'poisonous species', 'risks', 'immediate medical treatment', 'lot', 'poison', 'fish', 'salad', 'poisoning']"

Maybe it's your lack of a six-pack or your hairstyle? You should fix all the things you dislike about yourself first before you try to make yourself attractive to others, because you won't be confident! Confidence is the key.; , Studies show that women prefer a clean-shaven man or at least one who keeps his facial hair tidy. So if you have a bushy knee-length beard and you're wondering why the women aren't all over you... statistics suggest shaving it off. This also goes for eyebrows. If you have the dreaded monobrow or extremely bushy eyebrows, don't fear going to a waxing specialist to get them cleaned up, it'll be worth it.  , There are many different attractive hairstyles for men. If you don't know which one to choose, try flipping through a magazine or Googling some actors to give you an idea. Or if you're really in doubt, ask your hairdresser what kind of hairstyle they think would look good on you. And if you're balding, there are many new products on the market at the moment which advertise hair growth.  , Do you think your unfashionable trousers and Hawaiian shirt are suitable day-wear? Think again. Customize your new look. It should be moderately comfortable, fashionable and appropriate. Perhaps even have an idol, like a famous male actor. If you're really hopeless with clothing, get a friend to help until you get the hang of realizing what's acceptable to wear out and what's not.  , I'm not going to lie, a beer gut and flabby arms aren't exactly every girls dream.

Alt Revenue = $24 x 530 = $12,720  Marginal Revenue = 12720−12500530−500=22030{\displaystyle {\frac {12720-12500}{530-500}}={\frac {220}{30}}} ≈ $7.33   , You'll generally need access to a company's internal inventory figures or sales reports to determine the number of products sold. Finding the alternate price to sell one more unit is much more difficult, and requires skill market analysis.  Remember, marginal revenue is only useful when analyzing a single product. Some reports may only list data for groups of products.   , A negative marginal revenue means the company would lose revenue if it lowered the price. In this case, selling more products would not make up for the lowered revenue per product. , Companies that optimize the price/sales balance are said to have a level of output where the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost. Marginal cost is the cost to the company of producing one more unit of product.Marginal Cost = AltProductionCost−CurrentProductionCostAltProductsSold−CurrentProductsSold{\displaystyle {\frac {AltProductionCost-CurrentProductionCost}{AltProductsSold-CurrentProductsSold}}}.  For example, it costs Kim's Soda $50 to produce 200 cans of soda. Kim's could spend $60 instead to produce 225 cans. Marginal cost = 60−50225−200{\displaystyle {\frac {60-50}{225-200}}} = $0.40. Kim's soda should only enact this plan if marginal revenue is equal to or greater than $0.40.   ,  In the examples above, we've been dealing with a simplified market model that considers only one company without competition (a monopoly).More commonly, companies are under pressure to keep prices low due to competition. Under perfect competition, marginal revenue doesn't change as a result of the number of products sold, because prices are fixed.  For instance, let's say that Kim's, the soda company from the examples above, is now in competition with hundreds of other soda firms. The price per can is set at $0.50 — any lower and Kim's will lose money, and any higher and customers will choose other products. Marginal revenue is always $0.50, since Kim's cannot sell cans for any other price.   , In real life, the small, competing firms that make up highly competitive markets aren't perfect. They don't instantly react to each others' price changes, they don't have perfect knowledge of their competition, and they don't always set their prices for maximum profitability. This sort of market system is called ""monopolistic competition."" Marginal revenue will typically decrease with each additional product sold, but not as steeply as it would in a monopoly.  For example, Kim's drops the price of its soda from $1 to $0.85. It may still receive additional revenue, but in a monopolistic market, customers will still buy their competitors' soda for a higher price.   , In an oligopoly, a few large firms that are in competition with each other control the market. Marginal revenue usually has a downward trend with each additional unit sold, as it would in a monopoly. However, in real life, firms in an oligopoly are often reluctant to lower prices because it can result in a price-dropping war, reducing profits for all.Often, firms in an oligopoly will only lower their prices to force a small competitor out of business, then raise prices together to increase profitability for all.If firms in an oligopoly have agreed to set prices like this, sales levels depend on marketing and other considerations, not on price.  Kim's has become a major soda player and now shares the market with Linda's and Andy's, two other soda firms. The three firms agree to sell their sodas at the same price, so marginal revenue for each additional soda will remain unchanged regardless of the price level they chose. If Jeff starts a small firm to undercut their inflated price, the three large firms may drop their prices so low that Jeff is forced out of business. The firms accept the reduced marginal revenue temporarily because they can raise the prices again once Jeff's is gone.

"['decide where you want to retire', ""set aside three months' expenses"", 'work with a financial planner', 'consolidate your accounts', 'avoid unnecessary fines and fees']",How to Save for Retirement As a Digital Nomad2," You know you're not going to be a digital nomad forever. Before you start saving for retirement, you need to have a good idea what country you will live in when you do retire, so you can maintain your savings in that currency.If possible, you also want to set up your savings and investment accounts in that country, so they'll be easier to access once you do retire. Most digital nomads plan on retiring in their home country. Don't choose another country unless you are certain you'll be able to immigrate there when you're ready to retire and settle down.  , You want to have an emergency fund separate from your retirement savings. Look at your budget and determine how much your expenses will be, on average, for at least three months.This money will protect you and enable you to survive as a digital nomad if, for example, you lose a contract or have a hard time finding work in one location. You also may want to include sufficient money for a plane ticket, so if you get into a difficult situation somewhere you can quickly bail out and return to your home country or somewhere else where you feel safe. Keep this money in a basic savings account so it will earn interest, but you can access it quickly if you need to do so.  , While life as a digital nomad may seem carefree and simple, your finances typically will be anything but simple. Look for a licensed or certified financial planner who has experience working with digital nomads.You don't necessarily have to keep a financial planner on retainer long-term, but it's a good idea to at least consult someone when you're setting up your savings and investment accounts. Ask the financial planner about sound investment strategies, and put the framework for your savings and investments in place. You also want to ask about tax strategies.  , Having too many financial accounts can be difficult to keep up with when you're traveling, especially if you have accounts scattered across several different countries. While this sometimes can be unavoidable for digital nomads, you want to try to have as few accounts as possible.For example, if you settle in one country for a longer period of time and take a day job, you may need to open a local bank account. When you move on somewhere else, close that account. Try to have a specific purpose for each account you have. For example, you might have a retirement savings account, a checking account for daily expenses, and a basic savings account for your emergency fund.  , When you're traveling, it can be relatively easy to rack up significant fines and fees, as well as facing significant tax consequences, if you're not careful. Work with a professional financial advisor to build a sound strategy.You typically will need at least one credit card, but try to pick one that has the best rewards for you as you're traveling, as well as the strongest purchase protection. Choose a card that doesn't have an annual fee. If you have any credit cards that do have annual fees, you may want to close those accounts before you start traveling to avoid those fees. Check with your bank or financial advisor to choose the retirement fund or investment vehicle that has the most favorable tax status in the country where you plan to retire. You also may want to review tax penalties for early withdrawals, in the event of a significant emergency situation. Carefully review the tax laws in your home country regarding money earned in other countries, or speak to a tax expert. Make sure you're not going to end up paying any fines or penalties for not filing taxes appropriately.  ","['months', 'accounts', 'unnecessary fines', 'fees', 'financial planner', 'expenses']"

Otherwise, pick an air area with strong air circulation. If necessary, set up fans and/or open windows to improve airflow., Drape a dropcloth, tarp, or similar covering over your worktable. Do the same for the floor or any other nearby surfaces that may potentially get dirty from your project. Then secure your covering(s) in place with duct tape. This will make clean-up a cinch., Wear work gloves to protect your hands. Also wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. Additionally, wear a dust mask, even if air circulation is strong, since mixing and sanding concrete will still introduce a lot of particles into the air., You’re going to need two bowls of different sizes in order to cast your mold: one to shape the fire bowl’s exterior, and a smaller one to shape its interior. First, pick one that matches the size you have in mind for your fire bowl. Then choose a smaller one that will fit inside the first. Also make sure that the smaller bowl is:Wide enough to fit a sterno can, with ample space left over between the can and the bowl’s rim to fill with fire glass or stones. Deep enough so that the top of the sterno can is below the bowl’s rim, in order to contain spills. Roughly half the size of the larger bowl to ensure that the fire bowl’s walls will be sufficiently thick.  , How much concrete you need will depend on the size of the bowls you chose (as well as how many bowls you intend to make). Err on the side of caution and purchase a larger bag of concrete mix than you think you’ll need. Follow the brand’s instructions on how much water to mix that particular formula, and in what increments.ShapeCrete and Quikrete are two popular brands for small DIY projects., Now that you’re concrete is mixed, ensure that you’ll be able to easily remove it from its mold before you pour it in. Spray the interior of your larger bowl with non-stick cooking spray. Then do the same with the exterior of the smaller bowl. Lubricate them now so that concrete won’t cement with them as it dries., Use a trowel to fill the bottom of your larger bowl with wet concrete. As you do, flatten the concrete so it’s nice and flat. Once the bottom is covered, use a level to make sure the flat surface is level., Once the concrete in the larger bowl is flat and level, set the smaller bowl on top of it. Judge its depth within the larger bowl. If its rim stands higher than the larger bowl, remove it, empty some of the concrete, and try again. If, on the other hand, the smaller bowl is still too deep inside for your taste:Take the smaller bowl out and add more concrete. As you do, just remember that you want to keep the concrete flat and level. Also check the smaller bowl’s exterior to make sure it’s still coated in cooking spray. If it isn’t, clean off any concrete and spray it again., Once the bottom layer of concrete is the right height, center the smaller bowl on top of it. Then begin filling the gap between the two bowls with more concrete. Depending on your taste, you can fill the gap all the way up to the smaller bowl’s rim, or you can quit sooner to ensure a higher wall between your fire bowl’s flame and its surroundings., Once the gap is filled to your satisfaction, lift the larger bowl and drop it on the ground or your worktable from a height of a few inches or centimeters. Force any bubbles or other gaps that may have formed within the concrete to collapse. Then, if needed, add more concrete to the rim of your fire bowl to correct any flaws., Place weights inside the smaller bowl so it’s less likely to move in case something bumps into your mold while it dries.Prevent any foreign elements from settling into the wet concrete by covering it with a dropcloth, tarp, plastic, or any other protective covering. Then follow the concrete’s directions regarding how long you’ll need to wait for it to dry., First, turn the bowl upside down.Then give the larger bowl a couple of soft taps with a rubber mallet to loosen it from the concrete. Pull the larger bowl off the fire bowl. Then turn the fire bowl right-way up and pull out the smaller bowl., If you like the look of a rough bowl, feel free to skip this step. Otherwise, give the fire bowl a look over. Use 60- to 80-grit sandpaper to smooth out any flaws.For an even smoother finish, repeat with a finer grit, like 150., First, center one or more sterno cans within the fire bowl. Fill the gaps between those and the bowls’ wall with fire glass or stones. If you want to hide the cans under a layer of glass or stones, place a grill grate on top of them, then layer your glass and stones on top of that to keep them from falling into the sterno cans.If you’re layering glass or stones directly over the flames, be sure that they are safe for such use. Ask staff at your local garden center which types of stone are best for this best purpose. If you’re unable to find a grill grate that will fit inside your fire bowl, you can fashion your own out of metal hardware cloth.

When confronted, he or she may deny knowing what you are talking about or accuse you of overreacting. Stay centered in your own perceptions, and learn how to identify passive aggression.   Some expressions of passive-aggressive behavior include sarcastic remarks and responses, being overly critical, temporary compliance (the person verbally agrees to the request but chooses to delay acting upon it), intentional inefficiency (the person complies with the request but fulfills the request in a poor manner), allowing a problem to escalate through inaction and taking pleasure in the resulting anguish, sneaky and deliberate actions taken in order to get revenge, complaints of injustice, and the silent treatment. ""I'm not mad"" and ""I was just joking"" are some common things that passive-aggressive people say.Other signs of passive aggression can include hostility toward demands made on their time, even if it's understated, hostility toward figures of authority or those more fortunate, procrastination in dealing with other people's requests, purposefully doing a bad job for other people, acting cynical, sullen, or argumentative, and complaints about being under-appreciated.Passive-aggressive behavior is defined as indirect resistance to the demands of others and an avoidance of direct confrontation. The avoidance of direct confrontation is where we may find the most trouble.; , It might seem like a person's trying to get under your skin, but it's also possible that you are being overly suspicious and taking their behavior personally. Examine your own insecurities — are you used to people in your past giving you a hard time? Does this person remind you of that? Are you assuming this person is doing what the people in your past did?   Put yourself in the other person's shoes. From that perspective, do you think a reasonable person might act similarly in those circumstances?Bear in mind, too, that some people may be constantly late or slow to complete a task because of a disorder like ADHD. Don't be quick to assume that their behavior is actually directed at you.  , Dealing with a passive-aggressive person can make you feel frustrated, angry, and even despairing. It may seem as though there is nothing you can say or do to please the person.You may feel hurt by being on the receiving end of passive-aggressive behaviors. For example, perhaps the person has given you the silent treatment. You may feel frustrated that the person often complains, but never seems to take steps to improve his or her situation. Pay close attention to your instincts. Being around the person may leave you feeling tired or deflated, since you've spent so much energy trying to deal with the passive aggressive behavior.  , The power of positive thinking helps in coping with the daily affairs of life. Passive-aggressive people will try to drag you into a vortex of negativity. They are looking for a negative response sometimes so they can put the focus back on you without getting blamed for it. Don’t allow this to happen.Staying positive means you don’t sink to their level. Don’t be passive-aggressive back. Don’t name call, shout, or become overtly angry. If you remain positive, you will be in a better position to keep the focus on their own actions, not yours. If you become angry, you will divert attention away from the real problems. Model positive behavior. Whether you're dealing with children or adults, address your own conflicts in a manner that lets others know how to interact with you. Passive aggression vents emotion from behind a mask of indifference. Instead of doing that, be open, honest, and direct about your emotions. When you encounter passive-aggressive behaviors like the silent treatment, guide the conversation in a productive direction.  , If you’re upset, calm down before you address the issue (take a walk, crank up the music and dance, do the crossword), and then figure out exactly what it is you need from this situation, such as what reasonable outcome you can live with.   Do not overreact in anyway, especially with anger. And do not directly accuse someone of being passive aggressive, for this opens a window for them to deny everything and to accuse you of ""reading into it"" or of being too sensitive/suspicious. No matter what happens, don’t lose your temper. Don't let the person see that he or she got a rise out of you. If you do, it reinforces the behavior and could increase the chances that it will occur again. Resist the urge to act out any reflexive anger or emotionally colored reaction. You'll appear much more in control, and you will come across as someone whom you cannot just push around.  , Assuming you are emotionally stable, self-respecting, and calm, the best approach is to simply express what seems to be happening (For example, ""I may be wrong, but it seems that you're upset that David wasn't invited to the party. Do you want to talk about it?"")   Be direct with the person and specific. Passive-aggressive people can twist your words using technicalities if you speak too generally or vaguely. If you're going to confront a passive-aggressive person, be clear about the issue at hand. A danger of confrontation is that statements turn too global with phrases like ""You're always this way!"" This won't get you anywhere, so it's important to confront the person about a specific action. For instance, if the silent treatment is what gets on your nerves, explain that a specific incident where you were given the silent treatment made you feel a certain way.  , Do this in a non-confrontational manner, but firmly, such as saying, ""You seem to be pretty upset right now"" or ""I feel like something is bothering you.""   Express the way their behavior is making you feel, such as saying, ""When you speak in such a curt way, it makes me feel hurt and dismissed."" This way, they have to acknowledge the effect their behavior is having on you. Focus on how you feel, and don't use blaming language that castigates them. Use “I” statements. When communicating with someone, especially during conflict, try to use “I-statements”, rather than “You-statements.” For example, rather than saying, “You’re so rude,” you could instead say, “I felt bad after you slammed the door because I felt like you didn’t want to listen to me.” The first statement is a you-statement. Typically, you-statements imply blame, judgment, or accusation. In contrast, I-Statements let you express feelings without pointing fingers. The person who is being passive-aggressive is beating around the bush. Don't beat around the bush back at them. Be straight, but kind. Be honest, but gentle. Don't sugarcoat it either, though.  , Although you don’t want to provoke an angry confrontation, you also don’t need to be a passive-aggressive person’s punching bag. Passive aggression can be very damaging and a form of abuse. It’s your right to set boundaries.   One of the biggest mistakes people make is to be way too lenient. Once you give in to passive-aggressive behavior, you lose your options. This is, at its root, a power struggle. You can remain positive and calm, while still being strong and firm about how much you are willing to take. Follow through on the limits you set. Make it clear that you won't tolerate being mistreated. If a person is constantly late and it bothers you, make it clear to the person that next time she is late meeting you for a movie, you're just going to go in without her. That’s a way of saying you’re not going to pay the price for his or her behavior.  , The best way to deal with this type of anger is to detect any changes as soon as possible. The best way to do this is to get to the root of the anger.   If this person is one who doesn't typically show anger, then talk to someone who knows the person well enough to tell what angers him or her, and what subtle signs that the person may give when angry. Dig deeply, and honestly assess what might be driving the passive aggression. Passive-aggressive behavior is usually a symptom of another cause.  , There's aggressive communication, there's passive communication, and there's passive-aggressive communication. None of these is as effective as assertive communication.   Assertive communication means being assertive and nonreactive, yet respectful. Show confidence, be collaborative, and express that you want to solve the problem in a way that works for both people.It's also important to listen and not inject accusations or blame into the conversation. Consider the other person’s point-of-view, and acknowledge it. Validate their feelings, even if you think they are wrong.  , If a person is passive-aggressive towards you on a regular basis, it is perfectly reasonable to avoid that person. You have to put your own well-being first.   Find ways to spend a limited amount of time with the person, and try to interact with them when you are in a group. Avoid one-on-one interaction. If they are not contributing anything significant besides negative energy, ask yourself whether it is worth keeping them around in your life at all.  , Don't tell the passive-aggressive person your personal information, emotions or thoughts.   They may ask questions about your life that seem innocent or kindly concerned. You can answer such questions, but avoid giving detailed information. Keep it brief and vague, but friendly. Avoid topics that are sensitive or reveal your personal weaknesses. Passive-aggressive individuals tend to remember such things you've told them, sometimes even little things in passing, and will find ways to use it against you later.  , This person should be an objective third party, whether it is an HR representative, a close (but objective) family member, or even a mutual friend. The point is to use someone whom the passive-aggressive person can trust also.   Before meeting with the mediator, give him or her a list of your concerns. Try to see things from other people's points of view, and understand why they are so angry. Don't be obnoxious and just get all passive aggressive about them pushing you away, even if you are trying to help. When you confront the individual yourself, you may hear ""relax it was a joke"" or ""you take things too seriously."" That’s why having a third party intervene can work better.  , Since passive-aggressive individuals operate covertly, they will almost always put up resistance when confronted on their behavior. Denial, excuse making, and finger pointing are just a few of the likely retorts.   Regardless of what they say, declare what you're willing to do going forward. Importantly, offer one or more strong consequences to compel the passive-aggressive person to reconsider his or her behavior. The ability to identify and assert consequence is one of the most powerful skills we can use to ""stand down"" a passive-aggressive person. Effectively articulated, consequence gives pause to the difficult individual, and compels her or him to shift from obstruction to cooperation.  , The goal of reinforcement is to increase the rate of that behavior.   This might mean rewarding good behavior that you want to perpetuate or punishing bad behavior you want to eliminate. Positive reinforcement is easier said than done, because bad behavior is more noticeable than good behavior. Be on the lookout for good behavior so you can take every opportunity to reinforce it. For example, if a passive aggressive person is open and honest about their feelings — “I feel like you are being mean to me on purpose!” — that's a good thing! reinforce this behavior by saying “Thank you for tell me how you feel. I really appreciate it when you tell me how you feel.” This will draw positive attention to the good behavior, communicating their feelings. From there you can work to open up a dialogue.

Try to find a tarp or blanket that is at least 8 feet wide and 8 feet long (2.4 meters x 2.4 meters), as you will need to fold it to make the stretcher.If you cannot find a large blanket, you can try putting together two smaller blankets so they are at least 8 feet by 8 feet (2.4 meters x 2.4 meters).; , While you don't need to use poles to create a simple stretcher, they will make your stretcher sturdier. You will also need two poles that are of equal length and at least 8 feet long (2.4 meters). Look for wooden poles that are at least two inches thick, as this will ensure they are sturdy. You can use wooden poles that you cut down from a tree and shave down to be the same length and width. Or you may use metal poles.Make sure the poles are equal in length, as you do not want a lopsided stretcher. The poles should also be sturdy enough to hold some weight, as they will act as supports for both sides of the stretcher. If you do not have poles, you can make a very simple stretcher with just a blanket.  , You may decide to have a roll of duct tape on hand in case you want to secure the stretcher with the tape once you have put it together. If you are using a wool blanket, you may not need duct tape to secure the stretcher, as the friction between the two ends of the wool blanket will keep it in place. If you are using a tarp, you may decide to use the tape to secure the stretcher., Start by spreading out the blanket or tarp on an even surface, such as the floor. Make sure no corners are folded over and the blanket is laying flat.   You may also place the two poles next to the blanket so they are easy to access., You will first need to check that the blanket and the poles are around the same length. This will ensure there is no extra material hanging off the sides of the stretcher.   Measure the length of the stretcher by placing one of the poles on the blanket lengthwise. If the pole is not in line with the end of the blanket, you may need to fold over the end or both ends of the blanket so the blanket is around the same length as the poles. You may make the blanket about one to two inches shorter than the length of the poles so some of the pole sticks out on either end of the blanket. This will make it easier to hold and lift the poles once you use the stretcher.  , Once you have confirmed the length of the blanket, you will need to determine how wide the stretcher is going to be. Start by placing one pole lengthwise about two feet from the edge of the blanket. Then, consider how wide you want the stretcher to be. If you are trying to fit someone who is of average weight and height, you may place the other pole lengthwise two feet away (0.7 meters) from the first pole.If you are trying to fit someone who is a bit bigger or wider, you may space out the poles so there are three feet (0.9 meters) between the two poles. Try not to make the distance between the two poles too big, as you will need enough material on either side of the poles to fold over the poles.  , Now that the poles are in place, you will take one end of the blanket and fold it over the poles. It may only cover one of the poles and lay just behind the second pole. This is fine. Make sure the blanket lays flat over the poles.Then, take the other end of the blanket and fold it over the other pole. The two ends of the blanket should overlap each other. Make sure the poles stay straight lengthwise as you fold over the blanket. If you are not using poles, then you will wait until the person is on the blanket before doing anything to the sides., The two ends of the blanket should create enough friction to stay together on their own. If you want to make sure the stretcher is secure, you may use duct tape to secure the two ends of the blanket or the tarp. You may use one long strip of tape to keep the two ends of the blanket or the tarp together., To put an injured person on the stretcher, you should first move the stretcher so it is only a few feet away from the injured person. If the person is on a bed or a raised area, try to place the stretcher just below the person. This will make it easier to transfer the person to the stretcher., Tell the person, “We are going to move you onto the stretcher now.” You may then need someone to help you carefully slide or lift the person towards the stretcher. If the person is able to lift themselves up with their arms, they may do so and lay themselves down on the stretcher.If the person is lying down on a bed with a sheet, you may have the person cross their arms over their chest. Then, you may have someone help you lift the sheet the person is lying on, cradling the person, and place it on the stretcher. If the person has any head injuries, have a third person hold the person's head steady as they are lifted so their head does not shift or move around. Place the person in the middle of the blanket.  , Once the person is situated on the stretcher, you should have one person raise the back end, closest to the person’s head, with their body facing forward. The other person should raise the front end of the stretcher, closest to the person’s legs, with their body facing away from the person on the stretcher.Then, you may count together ""1, 2, 3"" and lift the person on the stretcher on ""3."" This will make it easier to lift the stretcher evenly and bring the person to safety. If you are not using poles, then you will need two people on each side of the blanket. Have the partners on each side roll up a few inches of the blanket on their side until the roll is thick enough to grasp and hold onto. As one unit, all four people will lift the blanket together to transport the person., You and the other person may try to coordinate your movements so the stretcher stays even and steady. This could be done by counting each step you take together out loud or by trying to find a rhythm to walk to so you are both walking at the same pace.Make sure you keep a good grip on the stretcher poles and the person carrying the other end of the stretcher does the same. You do not want the injured person in the stretcher to be bounced around, as this could lead to further injuries.

If you break things, attack people or otherwise get aggressive, this is one of the main warning signs of anger control issues. You will want to seek treatment with a counselor before you hurt yourself or others.Assess whether you often find yourself in arguments with friends, family or acquaintances. Although arguments can be common in relationships, those that escalate quickly and happen very frequently can be signs of an anger control problem. Go back through your track record with the law. Look into whether you have had frequent problems with the law or driving rage that led to traffic tickets.; , Not all anger is expressed openly. If you are incited to anger that you hold in, you may have benefit from anger management treatment.   Take note of how you respond to both the more obvious anger-eliciting situations, such as if someone is very rude to you, as well as more every day activities, such as watching television, commuting, driving or working in general.  , Anger is a powerful and highly visceral emotion, often leaving a trace on your body. Take note of how your body feels and pay attention to particular signs of anger.   There are several bodily signs of anger. These include grinding of the teeth, clenching of the fists, headache or stomach ache, an increased heart rate, feeling hot or dizzy, redness of the face, having sweaty palms, or clenching of the fists or general tensing of your body. , People with anger control issues can have trouble concentrating once they feel anger. They may be unable to compromise, feel empathy or accept that other people's views are different from their own.Some people find that they channel this obsession with an angry feeling with sarcasm, pacing and raising their voices. You may find that you lose your sense of humor quickly when anger starts to rise.  , One sign that you may benefit from anger management treatment is if your anger is having a negative impact on others or your relationships with them.Do others end up hurt physically or emotionally after you have an episode of anger? Do you find yourself losing social connections because of your anger? Do you find yourself regretting the way you treated others as a result of your angry outbursts? If so, then the costs of your anger are steep and you may benefit from anger management.Because of their hostility, individuals with anger issues tend to have fewer friends. Social support is an important factor that can help protect from stress and illness., Frequent anger can make you feel bad, and be bad for you.If you find yourself having frequent headaches or other bodily distress and think this may be caused by your anger, you may benefit from anger management.   Keep in mind that some of the negative consequences of anger on your body cannot be felt, but the costs are still real. For example, frequently experiencing anger increases one's risk of heart disease, particularly among men. , Anger causes individuals to lash out and sometimes at objects, by damaging or destroying them. If you find yourself hitting, breaking, or damaging objects, you may benefit from anger management. , Angry people are cynical of others.Cynicism can involve a self-righteous attitude whereby an individual thinks that the things that make her angry are not things she would ever do herself.   For example, if a driver was holding up traffic because he did not realize the light had turned green, she might think, ""only an idiot would do that"" when in reality it is fairly easy to get distracted at a red light. If you think anger is causing you to view the world in a negative way, you may benefit from anger management treatment.  , Individuals with anger issues tend to consume more alcohol and other drugs than individuals without anger issues. Over-consumption of substances can be bad for health and can lead to social and other emotional problems., Ask yourself whether your anger is making you feel bad, either through the consequences of your behavior, or the way it is making you think about the world around you, or both.   If feelings of anger and the situations your anger gets you into is taking a toll on your subjective well-being, it may be time to seek out anger management., There are many different approaches to anger management and many different ways to get treatment for anger issues.   There is no need to restrict yourself to only one approach; if you try one approach and you are not satisfied with the outcome, after you're sure you've given it an honest attempt, try moving on to the next treatment option or try combining multiple techniques.  , Some treatments emphasize changing patterns of thinking or provide techniques to become and remain calm.   One approach focuses on relaxation. Relaxation techniques include deep breathing, imagining relaxing imagery, or slow exercises such as yoga; all of these techniques can help to quell anger. Relaxation techniques may be the best fit for you if you enjoy reducing stress primarily through your body. Another approach is called cognitive re-structuring, which just means to change the way that you think. This approach emphasizes the use of logic and avoidance of certain words such as ""never"" or ""always"" to overcome the thoughts that cause or contribute to anger. This approach may be the best fit for you if you often find yourself in your head exacerbating your anger with certain thoughts or ways of thinking., Some treatments emphasize direct, actionable change as a way to reduce actual elicit of anger. These can be used in isolation or in combination with techniques that focus on changing ways of thinking.   One method emphasizes the use of problem solving. Sometimes frequent anger is not necessarily an overreaction to events but reflects an adaptive response to try to overcome real and important problems that have been difficult to surmount. Taking a problem-focused approach may be your best option if you feel this is true of your situation and your relationship with anger. Sometimes it may be best to change your environment. In some cases, there are factors in your environment that contribute to excessive anger and one effective way to manage anger can be to work to change your environment in some way. For example, if your job has many triggers that make you angry, considering applying for a new job that you think would make you happier or less angry. This may be best for you if you have identified a specific environmental factor, just as your job, that is greatly contributing to your anger.  , There are blogs and websites dedicated to helping people accept and overcome anger management problems. This may be a good resource if you are having trouble admitting your problem to others.  , Ask your family doctor for a recommendation to a psychologist or counselor. When you call the counselor or psychologist's office, you may ask for their recommendation on who is most appropriate to see to help you work through your anger management.   For another way to find in-person treatment options, search the internet for “anger management treatment” and your city name or visit http://locator.apa.org/ to find a psychologist near you. , These may contain worksheets that can help you more concretely identify anger elicitors and help you to determine the best treatment approach for you.   For example, a worksheet may help you to determine that you are often in your head and that specific thoughts are contributing to your anger, which might lead you to focus on seeking a cognitive re-structuring approach.  , You'll not only release your anger in a healthy and positive way,but you'll get a great workout.","['counselor', 'anger', 'options', 'bag', 'resources', 'pair', 'thoughts', 'alcohol', 'attitude', 'history', 'treatments', 'pay attention', 'note', 'list', 'well-being', 'search online', 'feelings', 'boxing gloves', 'relationships', 'local library', 'psychologist', 'body', 'objects', 'behavior', 'environment change', 'anger management books', 'consumption', 'drugs']"

Expect your lab to be loyal, lovable, and happy. These positive traits make him the number one registered dog in the American Kennel Club. Anticipate a boisterous and energetic temperament. The Lab has the reputation of being one of the most sweet-natured breeds, and is outgoing, eager to please, and friendly with both people and other animals. ; , Chocolate Labs make great additions to homes with small children or other pets, and are well-suited for homes that have a good deal of space.   Prepare for clumsiness. A young Lab can be accurately described as a “bull in a China shop!” This means that you can expect vases to be knocked over by wagging tails, and carpets to be displaced by skidding dogs.  , Chewing and mouthing is a common problem among Labradors, and this breed requires an ample amount of chew toys on hand to prevent the destruction of your valuable possessions. Consider the need to enroll your Chocolate Lab in obedience training. Plan to train your Chocolate Lab before he gets too large to control. As the Chocolate Lab is a relatively large dog, teaching him manners is vital. This includes learning not to nip (playful bites), not to jump on people or barge them over, and to relieve themselves in appropriate locations.  , All Labs love activity and require it for a happy and healthy life!   Prepare to exercise your Chocolate Labs. This breed needs exercise to keep their cardiovascular and muscular systems healthy. Every adult Labrador should have a minimum daily walk of at least half an hour, and a longer and more vigorous exercise session of 1-2 hours at least three times a week. Expect to give your Labrador the opportunity to run every day in order to burn off excess energy. , A male Chocolate Lab can weigh up to 80lbs, meaning that he will eat a lot of dog food. In addition to food, veterinary costs can be very high, and you should budget for some kind of pet insurance. Ensure you are financially secure enough to purchase a Chocolate Lab.  , While Chocolate Labs are generally healthy dogs, they can be plagued with certain health issues that must be identified and managed. Health problems can be inherited genetically (including cancer, epilepsy, and autoimmune diseases), or can be caused by the environment (contact with chemicals, medications, breathing in smoke). Some of the more common health problems include hip and/or elbow dysplasia, obesity, epilepsy, cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), tricuspid valve dysplasia, gastric dilation-volvulus, myopathy, cold tail, and ear infections. Visit your veterinarian if you have any concerns regarding your Chocolate Lab’s health. If you see signs or symptoms indicating the onset of any of these conditions, it is best to get your dog checked by his vet as soon as possible.  , There is nothing like a new puppy, with his cute and affectionate disposition and his big round eyes. However, a puppy requires a large time commitment, especially during their first year of life. Ensure your puppy has all his immunizations. Puppies should receive a set of four injections every three weeks starting at six weeks old. House-train your Labrador Puppy and take him outside every few hours (at least) to relieve themselves. Socialize your Chocolate Lab puppy when he is young. The goal is to encourage positive, respectful, and calm interactions with other people and animals. Provide obedience training to instill a solid foundation in good behavior. Obedience classes will help shape the personality of your puppy for years to come. , Adding an adult Chocolate Lab to your home can be a very worthwhile experience, as older dogs are less likely to be adopted and often the first to be euthanized. Ask the shelter or individual from whom you are adopting your Lab about his behavior and personality. Your dog’s general demeanor will be largely established by age 3, so it is important to know what to expect. Be patient and understanding of a dog who has had a past life. This can mean that he has been traumatized in certain ways, or has not been exposed to certain things. Even something as benign as a vacuum cleaner can incite a fearful response from your dog. Recognize that your older dog has different needs than a puppy. This can include requiring more vet visits for health issues, needing food made for mature canines, and adjusting exercise schedules accordingly.  , Chocolate Labs are very versatile dogs. They were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, and have made the transition to family pets as well. Decide if you want a Lab bred for competition. You can select a dog bred for his skill as a working dog or bred for the ideal look, movement, and temperament of the breed. Select an English Labrador if you are looking for a dog bred for show and conformation. This dog will be heavier, stockier, and have a thicker coat than American Labradors. He will also be calmer, quieter, and less active. Purchase an American Labrador if you want a dog bred for field trials and hunting. This dog will be slimmer, more agile, and have a thinner coat than English Labradors. Additionally, he will have a higher energy level.  , A good breeder will many health checks on both the sire and dam before breeding them to reduce the risk of health concerns in the litter and will openly provide this information to you. If adopting your dog as an adult, you may need to ask for this information.   Request to see health clearances for hip dysplasia and a ‘clear eye certificate’ (indicating no evidence of PRA). Pay special attention to your Chocolate Lab’s overall appearance, visible health, and activity level. You should be able to recognize any changes in energy, eating habits, behavior, or appearance once you bring your Lab home.  , This will have an effect on the personality of your puppy as he grows into an adult dog. The breeder should be willing and able to provide details on both parents. If possible, ask to meet the parents of the puppies. You can learn about the potential looks and temperament of your new puppy by meeting his parents.  , Regardless of whether you adopt a puppy or adult dog from a breeder or a shelter, he will need your love, attention, and time.  , A good breeder is the best place to purchase a Labrador puppy. In order to get a happy and healthy dog, never buy from an irresponsible breeder. Choose a breeder who tests her dogs to make sure they are free from genetic diseases and checks that the parents have sound temperaments. Pay specific attention to parental clearance from hip dysplasia and PRA. Talk to the breeder about any other illness the breeding stock may have. This can include epilepsy, osteoarthritis, or exercise induced collapse. Look for a breeder that breeds her Chocolate Lab puppies in her home. While there are exceptions, many kennel-bred puppies are not well-socialized and have not been given enough human attention. , Chocolate Lab puppies should not leave their litters before this age. This can be a sign of a puppy mill.  , These references can tell you about their adoption experience, how their dog is doing, whether any health problems have surfaced in their dogs, and provide details about the breeder during the sale and throughout the life of the dog.   Visit the National Labrador Retriever Club website to find a full list of breeders in good standing with the National Labrador Retriever Club who may be available to answer questions about choosing reputable breeders and can explain the importance of screening for hereditary diseases and tell you about their upcoming litters.  , Adopting a Chocolate Lab in need of a loving home can be an incredibly rewarding experience, but is not without its challenges. Before adopting, you should do the following:   Make contact with your local Labrador Rescue. Express your interest in adoption, and find out about their requirements regarding home visits. Many rescue societies will want to check out you and your family to make sure that your home and lifestyle is suitable for the adoption of one of their dogs. Identify a Labrador available for adoption and visit the dog. Ask for details about the dog’s past, including any behavioral problems or training issues. , Dogs that end up in rescues are not always the best behaved or best trained dogs. With the right care and in the right home, these behavioral problems can often be overcome; however, this takes time. Volunteer with your local animal shelter or rescue. Most rescue organizations are very grateful for voluntary help, and activities can range from caring for dogs, to providing foster homes, to carrying out home checks for prospective adoptive families. This can be a great way to understand the pros and cons of adopting a rescue dog without committing to the adoption process. Learn more about adoption from a shelter from wikiHow!  , Many pet stores sell puppies purchased from puppy mills, a breeding facility with the purpose of breeding the most dogs for the least money. Poor breeding conditions and inbreeding can cause serious health problems for puppy mill dogs. Visit your breeder in person, and do not blindly trust online ads. Many puppy millers pose as family breeders online and in ads in newspapers and magazines. Take the time to ensure you are buying from a reputable breeder. Beware of sellers offering multiple different breeds and types of puppies for sale. Be wary if you are shown puppies one at a time, without the dam or littermates present. Never purchase puppies that are caged or crated when shown to you. Avoid the temptation to “rescue” a puppy mill dog by buying him. Purchasing a puppy from a mill puts money back into the pockets of the puppy mill industry, and opens up a space for another puppy mill puppy. Alert your local animal control authorities if you see anyone keeping puppies in poor conditions.

This machine will target all the areas on your body that you will be using when in an actual boat: your legs, core, and upper body. You can purchase one of these machines for home use, or you can find them in many gyms or work out facilities.; , There are many exercises you can do to strengthen your core and abs. These exercises will help target not just your core, but your upper body as well:Plank: Lie face down on the ground. Place your elbows on the ground underneath your shoulders with your forearms extended straight in front of you. Then, left yourself up on your toes and your forearms, keeping your body straight. Hold this position for 30 seconds to two minutes, increasing the amount of time you hold as you get stronger. Side plank: Begin in the same position as the plank and lift yourself up onto your arms and toes. Then, slowly turn your body to the side, so that your weight is resting on one foot and one arm (either your left foot and arm or your right). Make sure your body is in a straight line and you aren't leaning over. Hold this position for 30 seconds to two minutes and then switch to the other side. V-sit hold: Sit on the ground with your legs straight in front of you and your upper body straight. Then, extend your arms out in front of you and slowly lift your legs off the ground. As you lift your legs off the ground, keep them straight, and slowly lean your upper body back, making sure to keep your back straight as you do so. Hold this position for 30 to 90 seconds.  , Your lower body is important when it comes to rowing because 60 percent of the strength you use to row should come from your legs. There are many exercises you can do to improve lower body strength, but a few to start with are:   Bridge: Lie on your back with you knees bent and feet flat against the floor, hip width apart. Then, slowly lift up your butt, using your glutes, until you have a straight line going from your shoulders to your knees. Hold the position for one to two minutes, or lower your butt and raise it again at a quick pace without letting your butt touch the ground. To make this position even harder, you can extend one leg straight out, keeping it in the air as you raise your butt. Barbell squat: Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and place a barbell behind your head across your shoulders and grip it with your hands. Squat like you are about to sit down, keeping your upper body straight and your chest out. Go as low as you can and then, stand back up and repeat. Do three sets of 12 reps.Barbell/dumbbell lunges: Start by standing up with your feet together. Position the barbell as you did before, or hold a dumbbell in each hand. Then, take a step forward, bending your front knee so it creates a right angle, and lowering your back knee so that it almost touches the ground. Then, bring your back foot next to your front foot and repeat on the other side. You can do these in place, or you can do them walking. Try to do 50 yards of walking lunges.  , Most rowers actually focus more on their core and legs because that is where most of their strength will come from, but it can be beneficial to improve your upper body strength as well. Along with doing planks, you can do a few of these exercises to improve your arm muscles:Plank push ups: Start in the plank position, but instead of putting your elbows on the ground, you will put your hands underneath your shoulders. Push up to a plank position, with your weight on your hands and toes. Then, lower your body, keeping your elbows close to your body (you don't want them to push outwards away from the body). Don't allow your body to touch the floor, and then push yourself up again into that plank position. Reverse grip pulldowns: This exercise requires a pulldown machine. Sit at the machine and reach above you with an underhand grip to reach the pulldown bar. Then, slowly pull it down, using your upper body strength rather than momentum, until the bar is in line with your chest. Then, slowly allow the bar to go back to its starting position and repeat. Barbell rows: This is a great exercise to target the muscles you'll need for rowing. Position your hands shoulder width apart on a barbell on the ground with an overhand grip. Bend your body over so that your back is flat, in a table top position and your knees are straight or slightly bent, depending on your flexibility. Then, lift the barbell up to your chest, keeping your back flat, and lower back down (try not to let it touch the ground). Do five sets of five reps and try to place as much weight on the barbell as possible.  , To begin rowing, you'll need to sit at the machine with your feet in front of you on the machine and your knees bent. Your arms will then be straight, extended in front of you, with your knees inside the arms. You will grab hold of the handle with both hands, and your stomach and chest should be resting against the tops of your thighs. This is called the ""catch"" position., Rowing on a machine consists of several different positions and phases. It's important to know these positions so that you can achieve the right movement on your machine. These movements can then be applied to competitive rowing in the water.You start at the catch position, and then you move to the release position through the drive phase. The drive phase is when you are pulling the handle towards your body and extending your legs. The release position is the position at the end of the drive phase -- your legs are straight in front of you, your body is sitting upright, and your arms are pulled in towards you. Then, you will move on to the rock over phase, to the recovery phase, and finally back to your catch position. The rock over phase is when you begin to release your arms from the release position, allowing them to go straight, but keeping your legs straight. Then, in the recovery phase, as your upper body bends forward and your arms are fully straightened, you will begin to bend your knees until you've reached the catch position.  , When you row, you aren't engaging your entire body at once -- there is a sequence involved. Rowing involves using your legs first (by first straightening them), then your core (by pulling your upper body back), then your arms (by pulling the handle to your chest). When you allow the handle to move back to its starting position you will do the reverse, first engaging your arms (by straightening them), then your core (by allowing it to be pulled forward), then your legs (by bending them).If you engage your muscles out of order or all at once, it can be difficult to get your timing and rhythm right, and it can also decrease the amount of power you are able to use. Make sure when you pull the handle back, that you allow your legs to fully straighten before you initiate the power with your core. Then, when moving to your starting position, make sure your arms are fully straightened before you bend your knees.  , You are not engaging all parts of your body equally. When rowing, 60 percent of the power will come from your legs, 20 percent in your core, and then 20 percent in your arms.If you use more arm strength than leg strength, you will be able to pull, but you won't be able to do so for long. Your upper body will get tired quickly and you'll begin relying on your momentum to pull rather than your strength.  , Rowing also depends greatly on your timing. Instead of doing one count out and one count in, you will take one count out and two counts in. This means that as you pull the handle towards you and extend your legs in front of you, you will use one count. Then, as you allow the handle to move back to its starting position, allowing your arms to straighten and then your knees to bend, you will use two counts.To get the right timing, you can practice saying ""one"" on the drive, and then ""two, three"" on the release and recovery phase. Or, you can say ""power"" on the drive and then ""patience, patience"" on the release and recovery phase. Timing your strokes is important because you want to make sure you have enough recovery. Because pulling takes more power, you'll need double the amount of time to release so that you can recover and prepare for your next pull.  , If you aren't sure where to sit, look for where the oarlocks are located. These are the small rings through which the oars are placed. Because the action of rowing is backwards, that is, the force of rowing propels you backwards, you should sit with your back to the bow (the front of the boat) and face the stern (the rear of the boat).   If they aren't in place already, run the oars through the oar hooks so that the blade is in the water and the handle is in the boat. Make sure the oarlock points towards the back of the boat. If your oarlock faces the bow of the boat, it will be more difficult to row because the pitch of your blade will be off. Make sure the boat you are using to row in is an actual rowboat. If you row in a boat not designed for rowing, the task of rowing is going to be much more difficult. An ideal rowboat is 12 to 17 feet in length.  , Some rowboats will come with foot stretchers that will need to be adjusted to the length of your legs. If you have longer legs, the foot stretcher may need to be adjusted so that it is farther away from you. To figure out where you foot stretchers need to be, push back in your seat until your legs are straight, and make sure the handles of the oars almost touch your body (but not quite).If you have lots of room between your handles and your chest when your legs are extended, you may need to move the foot stretchers away from you towards the stern. If you don't have much room between your handles and your chest, you may need to move your foot stretchers towards you, towards the bow. If you have more of a classic rowboat, or one that isn't designed for sports, you may not have foot stretchers or a seat that pushes backwards. In that case, you will still be doing similar arm movements as that of a rowing machine, but you won't be extending your legs.  , Your hand should be at the end of the oar, with your thumb on the tip of the oar. A typical rowboat has two oars, and the oars should be about twice the length of the beam of the boat, which is the width of the boat. For a beginner, it's best to use oars that don't overlap when you are in the catch phase.  , If you have a rowboat that allows you to straighten your legs and push back as you row, you will use the exact same motions as a rowing machine. If your rowboat doesn't allow you to straighten your legs, then use the same arm movements, and lean back as you enter the drive phase, so that you are still relying on some of your leg strength.   Make sure if you don't have the ability to extend your legs that you are using your shoulder and core strength and not your back to pull the oars towards you. However, your upper body should still only be some of the strength you are using. You want to use as much leg strength and lower body strength as possible. This may involve you using your glutes and hips for power.  , In this position you will begin to put your blade into the water. You will sit as you would at a rowing machine, with your knees bent and your arms straight in front of you. The blades will rest above the water, perpendicular to the surface of the water. You will then prepare to move onto the drive.  , In this phase, you will be moving the blade through the water, with the blade going towards the stern of the boat. As you move from the catch position to the drive position, your blade should enter the water, and you will pull the handles of the oar towards you while also allowing your upper body to fall back and your legs to straighten. If you are in a boat that allows you to mimic the drive position of a rowing machine, then do so.Make sure blades are just underneath the surface of the water, and not buried deep into the water, as it will be more difficult to row the deeper the oar is.  , This position is right before you take the blade out of the water, when your arms are bent, your back is straight and upright, and your legs are straight out in front of you. As you finished the drive phase, you should have pulled the handles of the oars towards your chest, and the blades should be in front of you, towards the stern of the boat.Once again, if you can copy the position of the release on the rowing machine, then do so. If not, keep your legs in whatever position you had them in, but make sure your upper body and your arms are positioned as they would be on a rowing machine.  , This phase is when you lift the blades out of the water, feather them, and then bring yourself to the catch position. As you take the blade out of the water, bring your upper body forward and begin to straighten your arms out in front of you. This will cause the handles of the oars to separate, and the blades will be pointed towards the bow of the boat.   Feathering your oars essentially means that once you lift them out of the water, you will turn them so that they are parallel with the surface of the water, and hold them an inch or two above the water. This positioning of the blade will give you less wind resistance.  , Now that you've made one row, you will return to your beginning position and row again. In the catch position, you will turn the blades from their feathered position so they are perpendicular to the surface of the water, and then prepare to take another row.  , If you are looking to turn your boat in a different direction, simply use one oar instead of two oars. If you want to turn your boat to the left, for example, you would use the left oar, and use your strength to pull just that oar. This will cause your boat to turn to the left.If you want to turn on a smaller radius, hold water with one oar and row with the opposite oar. For example, if you are turning your boat to the right, place your left oar in the water and hold water, and row with your right oar. For an even smaller radius, take a normal stroke with one oar and a back stroke with the other oar. To turn left, do a normal row with your left oar, but then do a backwards row with your right oar. Essentially in a backwards row, you will be bringing one oar through the water and towards the bow of the boat versus a normal row where you move the oars through the water towards the stern of the boat.  , With your blade slightly feathered, meaning it's not totally parallel to surface of the water, but it's not completely perpendicular, dig your blade into the water. As you stick your blade in the water, straighten your arms and your boat should stop in a short time.","['hand', 'middle', 'water', 'finish', 'overhand grip', 'motions', 'timing', 'arms', 'drive', 'linear progression', 'oar', 'power distribution', 'recovery phase', 'release position', 'blade', 'feet', 'foot stretchers', 'digging', 'body', 'rowing machine', 'catch position', 'different phases', 'boat', 'core']"
"['do fun things together', 'support each other', 'keep talking', 'appreciate your differences']",How to Get Along With Siblings1," It's very important that you find positive ways to interact with your sibling. One of the best ways to do this is just to do fun things together, things which you both like to do. Playing games together or going for a bike ride together will help you get to know one another while in a relaxing and fun atmosphere. In order to have a good relationship it's important to be involved in each other's lives and spend time together.   This doesn't mean living in each other's pockets, but rather making time for your sibling and looking for positive ways to interact. Having a reservoir of good experiences will help act as a buffer when a problem or conflict arises. You will work together more effectively if you can draw on happy memories of having fun together.; , As well as doing fun things together, you can help develop a strong relationship by demonstrating that you are there for your sibling and you support him. For example, if your brother has a big sports game go along and cheer him on. Even if you are not a big sports fan you are supporting your brother. He will appreciate you making the effort to be there and showing that you care, even if he doesn't tell you that.Supporting each other also means saying kind things, like congratulating your brother on his report card, and offering to help out with a chore or some work every now and then.If you complete chores as a team you will become closer as you learn to cooperate more effectively. For example, if you have to wash up, split the tasks so one person does the washing, and one does the drying.  , Try to maintain good communication with your sibling even if you are having difficulties getting along. Just making small talk can help to ease tensions which might otherwise escalate if you are not talking. You need to learn to understand each other and if there is a specific problem just listening to your sibling's concerns is the best way to start doing this. Take time to listen and acknowledge any grievances and work constructively to talk them through.   When your sibling is talking really ask yourself ""what does my sibling want me to know, what are they telling me?""Remember communication is about giving and receiving information, so listen carefully and don't assume to know what someone is going to say. You can involve your parents and have family meetings to talk about any problems you are having with your sibling., Although you are siblings, you are not the same person. You have different personalities, different interests and different strengths. An important part of building a strong and lasting relationship is understanding and appreciating these differences.You might want to play soccer all the time, but your brother wants to play music or do some reading. Don't think of your differences as things that divide you.   If your parents keep signing you up for things because your brother likes them, politely and calmly say that you have other interests. If your brother is going to play soccer suggest you do something you like at the same time. Then you can compare notes afterwards. Part of growing up is learning who you are as an individual, so it's perfectly normal to want to distinguish yourself from your sibling.","['fun things', 'differences']"

However, it is very difficult to remember all these dreams. If a dream wakes you up, write that down immediately in a dream journal that you keep next to your bed. If you go back to sleep before writing it down, chances are that you will forget it ever happened. You can only interpret your dreams if you can remember them in as much detail as possible.Keep a journal, working pen, and soft lamp next to your bed to make it easier to write dreams down in the middle of the night.; , Never skip a morning in your journal. Even when you do not remember your dreams, note that in your journal. You will soon train your brain to remember your dreams simply by reinforcing the journaling process.It is best for you to write your dreams down immediately after waking up to make sure that your conscious mind does not rewrite or alter the plot of the dream., Any dream you hope to interpret should be written down. This helps you recall your dreams in the short-term and the long-term.Be sure that you write down every detail you remember as well as your emotional state upon waking.Details to write down include:   People you met in the dream How you felt at each stage in the dream The setting of the dream Your physical manifestation in the dream--what did you look like? What were you wearing? The plot of the dream Your mode of transportation in the dream The origin and destination of your dream journey The motivation for your dream journey  , If you dream about journeys often, you might begin to see common themes and patterns emerging over time. By recording your dreams, you will be able to determine these recurring patterns more clearly and accurately, allowing you to better understand your own dreams.Reread your dream journal to determine whether journeying is a common theme in your dreams, which could be significant.   Pay attention to subtle changes in your dreams over time. They might tell you whether you are growing and changing in important ways., Sometimes journey dreams involve you moving under your own power, such as when you walk, run, or fly. Other journey dreams involve you being moved by a vehicle such as a boat, car, or train. Take a few minutes to consider whether you were moving yourself or whether something else was moving you.Ask yourself whether you were the one in control or whether someone else was in charge of your journey. For example, many flying dreams involve a feeling of confidence, control, and freedom.On the other hand, a dream where you are in the caboose of a train might indicate that you feel behind in life.This can help you decide whether your journey is a positive adventure that you chose or an unpleasant decision that you are forced to make.   The state of your vehicle might make a difference to the interpretation of the dream as well. A decrepit vehicle might indicate uncertainty or low self-esteem, for example. Think about whether your mode of transit reminds you of yourself or of anything important in your life., If your pathway is rough and your destination blocked along the way, this is an indicator that something is obstructing your path in life. You may be anxious about not achieving goals in life and you may lack faith in your abilities to get you to your destination. After waking, if you find that the obstacle is still looming large in your memory, you may need to make a change to your life to enable you to move on.If your pathway is clear and smooth, you may feel optimistic about new possibilities ahead.If your path involves a fork or a crossroads, that can mean that you have to face a decision that has several facets. Each probably has good and bad aspects and only you can weigh the consequences to see where the decision might lead you., Ask yourself how you feel about your ultimate destination. Are you excited to get there? Scared? Uncertain? Are you confident in the location of the destination, or is your journey taking you to new and strange territory? Answering these questions can help you interpret how you feel about important decisions in your own life. Do you want to try something new and exciting, or would you prefer to have stability in your life?Some dreams end in dead-ends instead of arriving at your destination. This suggests that the path you chose is not leading you where you want to be. Consider whether any aspect of your life is unsatisfying. Many dream journeys do not even have a destination, which indicates that you are more concerned with the process of the journey itself than your ultimate goals in life.  , What are you passing along your route to your destiny? A dreamer passing through a lush forest might be thinking about his or her wonder and personal growth.A dreamer traveling through a desert may be worried about loneliness, emptiness, and stagnation.If you do not recall the scenery or landscape around you, that may indicate that you are more concerned with the end goal than you are with the journey to get there.  , Getting lost, delayed, or distracted is a common theme in dreams involving travel. For example, you might dream that you lose your passport or that you took the wrong freeway exit.Being sidetracked demonstrates that something is sidetracking you from your real goals. Getting lost is a metaphor for being lost in life and not knowing your true direction. It can also mean that you are afraid of losing your identity. If you are frantically searching for a way back to the main road, it can be indicative of your need to find a map to life and to shore up your insecure feelings about your life.  , Many journey dreams will give you physical obstacles, burdens, and limitations that you do not experience in your waking life. If you are somehow limping or on crutches during a journey dream, this indicates that something is holding you back and impeding faster progress. If you are laden down by another person, this may mean that somebody in your life has become a burden and is holding you back.  , According to many theories of dream interpretation, certain major symbols have universal significance. These are recorded in dream dictionaries, which you can access online, in bookstores, and in libraries.If there are any major symbols you noticed in your dream, such as birds, snakes, teeth falling out, monsters, rainbows, or any other number of objects, look up their meaning in a dream dictionary. That might help you consider why they appeared to you while you were sleeping.  , Even though there may be some universal dream symbols and motifs, remember that your dreams are unique to your own personality, thoughts, and experiences.A road in your dream might mean something quite different to you than it would to another person. Do not let dream dictionaries obscure your own instincts or ideas.For example, flying dreams generally indicate freedom. However, if you felt anxious or claustrophobic during your flying dream, then pay more attention to your feelings than an entry in a dream dictionary., Where there any images or themes in your journey dream that are meaningful to you? For example, did you travel down a path that resembles where you grew up? Were you wearing your high school uniform? Think about any details that remind you of your childhood, career, or experiences.These might help you determine the meaning behind your dream.  , Were you happy to meet people during your journey, or did you feel like they were holding you back? Your thoughts and feelings about the people you met on your dream journey might help you figure out how you feel about the people you see in your waking life.For example, if you have to carry an annoying coworker on your back during your dream, that might indicate your frustration about how work tasks are being divided up.  , Dreams are important ways for people to solve major and minor problems in their lives. Simply dreaming about a topic can help you sort out how you want to proceed. Take a few minutes to list the major problems, dilemmas, or concerns you have in life. Your dream might have clues about your true thoughts and feelings about these problems, and might give you clues as to how to solve them., Sometimes dreams have major significance. Other times, objects appear in dreams simply because you have encountered these objects recently. This is known as ""day residue.""Feel free to ignore ""day residue"" in your dream interpretation, unless the residue evoked any significant emotions in you.   For example, your dream journey might take you past the restaurant where you ate lunch yesterday. This is likely day residue and not an important symbol to interpret.  , Dream journeys tend to indicate a concern about your general life path. Ask yourself whether you have recently experienced--or plan to experience soon--any major journeys. These could be physical journeys such as a cross-country move, vacation, or major work trip. These could also be metaphorical journeys such as getting married, changing careers, or finishing your degree.Take a few minutes to consider whether any of the feelings in your journey dream resemble feelings you have about your own life journeys.  , Dreams are often better at posing major life questions than they are at answering them.Do you feel like your dream is encouraging you to think more deeply about something in your life? Write down questions you have about your dream in your dream journal, and use them as a guide as you begin to make decisions about where your life will take you.   One way to help determine these questions is to think about other parts of your life that inspire the same emotions you felt in your dream. If you felt free and relaxed during your dream journey, think about other parts of your life that make you feel free and relaxed. Use this as a key to unlock the deeper meaning of your dream., If your dream journey was a difficult one, consider obstacles you face in your waking life. Ask yourself such questions as ""What obstacles are before me?"", ""Are my obstacles self-imposed?"", and ""What elements of my life need a good shake-up to let me move on?"". Look at your dream as an opportunity to solve your life problems.  , Dream interpretations are not neat and clean. Dreams are messy, confusing, and cannot always be understood. However, the process of interpreting dreams is valuable because they allow you to reflect deeply about your life.Even if you cannot come up with a simple explanation for your dream journey, congratulate yourself for pondering your life journey and reflecting on your life path.

Look for a place that has the perfect amount of space, ambiance, room to store tools and ingredients, and will be large enough to work in and entertain guests.Use a counter top, dresser top, or any other flat and level surface for your bar. Start small. You can always build a bigger and better bar as you need.; , Different alcohol types will require different storage methods. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight should be kept to a minimum. You will need to acquire a refrigerator that is an appropriate size for the bar you have planned. You could also create space in a refrigerator you already own. Opened wine bottles need to be kept cold to prevent flavor from altering. Beer can be enjoyed at room temperature, however, it is commonly kept cold. Many liqueurs are refrigerated. Champagne is nearly always kept chilled. Any older stock you have that is lower in alcohol content should be refrigerated to preserve flavor. Most highly alcoholic liquors do not require refrigeration.  , It might be tempting to purchase the highest quality alcohol and liquor, but it's not always necessary to do so. Some liquors are used mainly in mixed drinks, so their flavor isn't as critical as other liquors that are enjoyed alone, without mixing. Lower cost can mean lower quality ingredients, different taste, and different distillation techniques than more expensive brands. Higher cost does not always entail a better taste! All alcohol will have the same intoxicating effect, regardless of price.  , There are many different varieties of alcohol to choose from and the choice isn't always an easy one. However, there are some standards you can use to help narrow the selection process down.   Select varieties that you personally enjoy. Keep in mind the tastes of your guests and try to select for them. When starting your bar, don't go overboard.

Both colds and flus are notorious for making you feel really bad the day before they strike, so you can easily set your plan into motion 24 hours ahead of time.   You won’t need to do much to prepare for this bluff. Invest in a box of tissues – they’ll make very simple props. If you want to go the extra mile, make sure you have some pale makeup on hand. It only takes a quick pat of white face powder or foundation to give yourself a sickly, wan appearance.; , You’ll still have a handful of symptoms to fake, but this sham depends more on your acting skills.   Be prepared to do a lot of temple rubbing, squinting, pouting and pretending to be sensitive to light and sound. A little pale makeup is the only physical change you’ll need to make, and even that is optional, depending on the strength of your performance.  , For this reason, it’s better for getting out of work, not school. As long as you can handle discussing your bowels with your boss over the phone, the diarrhea scam is the most effective of them all because it’s rarely challenged.   The key to pulling this off is the phone call conversation. You’ll need to start by sounding very reluctant and embarrassed about the whole thing. Lower your voice and say something like, “This is so embarrassing, but I’m just going to come out and say it – I am having serious stomach issues today. I’m running to the bathroom every 15 minutes. It's really bad.” Insert a dramatic pause before whispering the words “stomach issues.”  , Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic stomach affliction that’s fairly common. The main symptoms are abdominal pain/cramping, bloating, gas, and alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea, which are all virtually invisible to an outsider.Only play this card if you can handle a long con, because IBS is chronic.   Take into consideration that chronic illnesses are serious. It's not very ethical to fake IBS. It is far more serious than a simple cold. Be aware that some employers/schools will want a doctor's note for this. Take your boss/teacher aside to share the information privately. Ask that your illness be kept between the two of you, since it’s so personal. Say that you “suffer from IBS” and it sometimes interferes with your daily life, but you’re working with your doctor to keep it manageable.  , If you're trying to get out of work, mention this to coworkers the afternoon before. Say that you’ve felt “off” all day and you’ve had trouble concentrating. When someone asks you a question, stare off into space and pretend you didn’t hear them. When they ask again, shake your head a little, as if you had to force yourself to snap out of it.   Say something like, “I’m sorry, this has been happening to me all day – I must be coming down with something.” Sway a bit and maybe grip the edge of a nearby piece of furniture so that it looks like you’re trying to steady yourself.  , For work, do this at lunch the day before. Drink only water and take small sips of it. When pressed, say something like, “I don’t know, I’m really just not hungry,” with a pained look on your face.   You could go further and say, “I actually feel pretty nauseous right now.” Look upset about it. Hide some snacks in your room (or work desk) ahead of time so that you won’t get too hungry later.  , Shiver and say something like, “I’m freezing. Does it seem really cold in here to you? Maybe I should turn off the air conditioner.” If you have access to the temperature controls where you are, adjust them beforehand so that it’s actually pretty warm.   If you're at home and this is for school, wrap yourself in a blanket and walk around the house with it.  , Whether this is for school or work, use makeup the day before. Dust your face lightly with white powder or use foundation to look unusually pale. Apply a little gray or purple eyeshadow under your eyes so that you look exhausted.   If you're doing this for school, don’t go too far with the makeup the day before – you’ll be using the more impactful makeup the next morning.  , You’ll have to turn out the lights in your room and actually pretend to be asleep, so prepare yourself to be a little bored.   Try to cough loudly and clear your throat a few times during the night so your parents will hear you. If your fake sickness is a stomach virus, be sure to get up several times during the night to go to the bathroom (set an alarm for every 3 hours, if that helps). Flush twice and wash your hands loudly so you can be heard. If your fake illness is a migraine, loudly toss and turn all night long. Moan occasionally. Knock on your parent's bedroom door at about midnight to ask for ibuprofen with a pained look on your face.  , Amplify the symptoms that you were faking the night before – don't add a bunch of new symptoms to the mix. To properly continue the ruse, just intensify whatever images and symptoms you planted in your parents’ heads the night before. If this is for work, make sure to remember the symptoms you used the day before. Mention these in your phone call to your boss.  , Use pale foundation and/or powder to look sickly. Put a dark eyeshadow under your eyes. Wipe all moisture off your mouth and avoid chapstick. Mess up your hair and look generally disheveled – maybe have just one sock on. Rumple your bedclothes so that it looks like you tossed and turned all night. All of those will be believable if you're faking a cold/flu, stomach virus or a migraine.   Additionally, if you're faking a cold or flu, you should also apply a small amount of blush to the tip of your nose, your nostrils, and the inner corners of your eyes. Litter crumpled tissues all over your bedside table and floor. Run hot water over a wash cloth and then apply it to your forehead for a few minutes so that you’ll feel feverish.  ,  Save this for when your parents are definitely awake so they can witness it. Stay in the bathroom for about 15 minutes. Cough and sputter loudly and flush multiple times. Come out slowly, holding your abdomen.  Go back in about 10 minutes later with a look of urgency on your face and repeat the same actions. Twice is enough. Don’t overdo it!  , If you're trying to get out of work, you'll do this when you call in. If it's for school say something like, “Oh no, I can’t get sick now! This is terrible timing. We are doing something really fun in theater class.” Sigh a few times and look bummed out. Try to steer the conversation so that your parent is urging you to stay home and you’re resisting. Just be sure to give in very quickly!   Don’t overact. If you take any of this too far, you may end up getting hauled to see a physician. That will definitely ruin your day off!  , When you return to school or work after your day(s) off, make sure to have a few light symptoms. If you show back up completely healthy, it will look suspicious. If you were faking a cold/flu, cough occasionally, look tired, and apply the lightest dusting of white powder. If you were faking a migraine or stomach flu, make sure you look pale and tired. Use the white powder and also apply a little purple eyeshadow under your eyes. This will make it look like you haven't been able to sleep well.  Droop your shoulders a bit and be less enthused than usual. After 2 days you can stop with the makeup. If you were faking a cold or flu, cough occasionally for 3-4 days after your return.

Never both. Nights out often call for a little sex appeal; there is, however, a line that falls between classy and trashy. A mini dress, skirt or micro shorts are perfectly acceptable to wear but if you wear them with a low-cut top, you will be sending out an image other than that of a classy one. This also applies in reverse: a low cut top can be perfectly acceptable, providing your legs and thighs are not clearly visible too! Think a mini length shift dress, or a low cut top with a knee length or just above the knee length pencil skirt.; , Insulting, suggestive or improper slogans or pictures will never be considered classy, though some may be humorous. When it comes to dressing classy, steer clear of any suggestive or rude language.  , Regardless of whether it is day or night, showing a little skin is fine: no one expects you to be entirely covered. But think about how much skin you would show at the office, meeting your boyfriend's parents or going to church. By all means, go for that crop top but make certain everything else is covered! A rule that many classy women go by is, ""show only one thing, cover up the other entirely"". That means if you are going to rock an appropriate amount of cleavage, do not wear shorts. Instead wear pants or trousers that cover up your legs.  , Those spandex micro shorts are not going to make the cut.   Try high-quality synthetics. They can look similar to natural fibers, particularly shiny protein-based animal fibers such as silk, satin and wool, and the subtle differences aren't necessarily bad. But they tend to cost less to buy, last longer, and, most importantly, cost next to nothing to maintain. If you prefer the feel of natural fiber, try synthetics on the legs, which are less sensitive, and outer layers, which are not felt much. If you're not sure about the surface appearance, at least try them on the legs, which are not observed as closely. You can find high quality products in some thrift stores if you know what you are looking for.  , Too-tight clothing is not classy! Tailored looks are a key feature of classy dressing. Squeezing into a dress is not classy!  , There will always be days where a nice over sized hoodie and tracksuit are acceptable but make wearing them the exception and not the rule. Baggy clothes do not make you look smaller; instead they just make you look frumpy and sloppy.  , Even in a casual outfit, ensure nothing is dirty, stained or damaged. Tacky items will only take away from the over all appearance.   Colors and fine patterns hide the inevitable occasional minor damage.  ,, Think of any of these as a pair of thin tights. If you couldn't wear that top with just a pair of tights under it then don't wear it with your leggings. End of story.  , Don't be overly fussy. Covering yourself in glitter and excessive orange make up will not look classy.  , The right accessories can give that outfit a boost, and make it look far more expensive than it is. A nice oversized pashmina style scarf with a pair of skinny jeans, a vest top, and sandals will look cute and classy.  ,, Things like jeans and simple coats are best bought at good quality as they will last you years.   Quality need not be expensive. The world has known how to make most of these items for many, many years, with established measuring and layout techniques, powerful machines, and modestly-skilled labor. Just check that not too many corners are cut, and don't spend a great deal because even the best clothing can get inadvertently torn or stained and wear through.  ,   Sticking to shops like H&M and Forever 21 where prices are reasonable and quality is important is highly advisable.  ,, Once you have an understanding of classy dressing, shopping in cheaper shops will be very simple.Get simple clothing and timeless pieces that can be worn throughout and past your economic slump.  , Colors like light pink, red, clear, pearl, nude will never disappoint you no matter what color you are!

Those who caution against it say that birds were meant to fly and we should not interfere with a parrot’s natural inclinations. Clipping the parrot's wings deprives them of this basic freedom.Consider other options first.   If you are planning to show your bird, it should never be clipped.; , Parrots respond very well to clicker training, and you can train your parrot to return to you when called. You can also use clicker training to modify unwanted behaviors, which can help your parrot stay happy and safe.If you are not willing to do the work to train a parrot, then you may want to reconsider if getting a bird is right for you.  , There are some dangers to letting your bird fly free in your home. They can potentially damage their feathers, knock things over, and consume things that they should not. Many household items can be dangerous to parrots, including toilets and other standing water, lightbulbs and stoves that get hot, ceiling fans, cords to blinds, and windows and mirrors.Ask yourself why you want a bird if you don't want it to fly or don't feel that your home is a safe environment. Consider that a different pet may be more appropriate.  , Parrots are quick and can take advantage of any open door or window to get out. Once outside, it may be difficult to get bird back if you have not trained them. With clipped wings, the chance of escape is reduced. And if your bird does get out, it’s much easier to get them back., Bird wings should not be clipped until the bird can fly. Clipping too early can stunt the regular growth of the feathers., If you’ve never done it before, it’s advisable to have your vet do it the first time. That way you can see how it works and then decide if you want to continue to do it at home., Find an assistant, a towel suitable for the size of the bird, a sharp pair of scissors, and styptic powder, available at pet stores. Styptic powder is essential if you end up cutting too much and your parrot bleeds.If you don't want to clip your parrot's wings yourself, ask the assistant to clip them., Drape the towel over both of your hands. Stay relaxed and face your bird. Gently wrap the towel around it if possible. If not, toss the towel over the bird and gently but firmly place your index finger on the top of its head and your other fingers around the sides of its lower beak. This will prevent biting and allow you and your assistant to arrange the towel safely. Make sure the feet are secured inside the towel to prevent scratching.Birds are very sensitive to stress, and it is possible that the bird may have a heart attack when forcibly restrained.  , Pull a wing out of the towel restraint and find the primary flight feathers. These will be the last ten and longest feathers on the wing. Talk to your vet before you cut the first time — different birds (depending on size) might need different feathers cut., Leave a few centimeters between the cut end of the feather and the smaller feathers above. You may be tempted to leave the outer one or two alone for appearance's sake, but this is unadvised as this may be enough to give your bird the lift it needs to fly., These feathers are new and just starting to grow out, still endowed with a waxy sheath and plenty of blood supply for growth. You should be able to see the blood in the feather tube. Generally if you accidentally cut one of these, the blood will clot on its own. However, if you end up re-injuring one of these, the blood probably won't clot. If you are inexperienced, you should keep Kwik Stop or another styptic powder handy to immediately stop the bleeding. Birds have very little blood, so stopping a bleed quickly is important.  , Do it in the same way you did the first wing. Cutting less off both sides is much better than cutting one wing (making the bird list to one side and unable to fly)., A good wing trim will allow your bird to exercise the pectorals, or wing-flapping muscles, and will give it some coasting ability. Your bird shouldn't fall like a rock when it tries to fly, since landing on its chest can kill a heavier bird. Always trim less rather than more until you see how your bird adjusts. Heavier parrots like African Greys should be clipped less severely, while most cockatoos should be clipped more., Also decide on a day to be ""Clipping Day,"" and mark it on your calendar each month. This should be the day you inspect the parrot’s feathers — they might not be long enough to clip. Then you would mark another date in the future to see (one week, two weeks ahead) if the parrot’s feathers are long enough., Make sure that you are doing the trim as you are supposed to. Your vet will be able to give you suggestions if he or she believes you haven’t mastered trimming your parrot’s wings.

Be interested in what she tells you. Do not look worried or angry. Ask her about the boy, or even ask to meet him. Then decide whether she should hang out with him or not.  , Don't be nosy though, that can really bug your teenage daughter. Also, if she seems like she doesn't want to answer your questions, stop asking and wait for another time, teens can get moody, just like the rest of us. Some examples of questions to ask are:   What is your favorite book? What is your favorite movie? What is your favorite color? What is your favorite song/album/singer/band? What do you like to do in your spare time? Where's your favorite place to shop? What is your favorite animal? What is your favorite or least favorite food? Or you can just make up your own questions.  , Get to know the top models, the gossip, the fashion, the makeup, the top singers and actresses. Just don't copy your teen, after all she is trying to find herself!  , That's the most important thing a parent should do.  , If she has a boyfriend, be supportive. Once you've met the boyfriend and gotten to know him, and feel like he's the right sort, you can let her go on dates with him. If you did not feel like the boy is trustworthy, tell your daughter the reasons why without exploding or banning the relationship.  , Give her her own space to grow but also kindly clarify the boundaries. Know that she may sometimes test these boundaries and that is when you need to remind her that she is aware of the boundaries and that they need to restored.   If you disagree with your daughter's choice of clothing, tell her face to face. Be reasonable. Talk to her about the problems with how clothing can be suggestive and the things that certain people may assume of some types of clothing.  , In other words, never be the type of parent whom your daughter would be scared of.  , Even though she may pretend she doesn't like it when you clean her room, she really does. Some random acts you could do are:   Cleaning her room/bathroom Cooking her an unforgettably tasty meal Buying her some make up you think she would like Buying her some clothes/jewelry she would enjoy  , Let your daughter know you trust her. And actually do trust her. Once she sees that you find her trustworthy, she will feel more likely to trust you.  , In this way, you will be respected too.   Make each of her birthdays extra special, by taking trips, or by having amazing parties.  , Take her somewhere she would like, for example to the mall or a music concert. *Take your daughter to places she has never heard of before and see if she finds new hobbies and good new experiences.

The type of flowchart described here is called a ""swim lane chart"" or ""Rummler-Brache chart.""The chart makes it easy to see who is responsible for each task, and helps identify areas where the process could be improved.   The flowchart should describe the process as it is currently done, not how it should be done.  , The flowchart will probably end up looking tidier and more readable if you use software for creating diagrams. Having an electronic file also makes it easier to make changes to the flowchart as needed. Search online for ""process mapping software,"" making sure to download or purchase one that can create Rummler-Brache charts.  , Each row can be labeled with a department, team, or the job title of individual. Each participant is responsible for tasks located in his horizontal row, extending across the page. This is sometimes called that participant's ""swim lane.""   The lanes may be color-coded or not. They should always be divided by bold, black lines to make the chart easily readable by color-blind people. Try to put groups that interact with each other adjacent to each other. This is not mandatory, however.  , Begin the process by placing the first task in a box near the left hand side of the page, just to the right of the participant responsible for that task. For example, if the Research division starts the process by creating a product idea, draw a box just to the right of the word ""Research"" and label it Create product idea.  , For example, if Research then sends its product idea to Marketing for focus testing, draw an arrow from Create product idea to a box in the Marketing row, to the right of the previous box. Label this box Focus testing.   Sometimes, a task might be repeated, for instance the product might later return for additional focus testing. If the process actually returns to the same earlier stage, draw an arrow back to the original box labeled Focus testing. If the process is actually different (for instance, this is a more advanced round of focus testing leading to different tasks), write a new box instead with a different name, such as Advanced Focus Testing.  , Most flow charts use boxes, diamonds, and circles, plus arrows between them. You've already encountered the box, which is labeled with the name of a task. Use a diamond when there are multiple possible results. Use circles when an end result has been achieved. Continuing the above example, draw an arrow from Focus testing to a diamond labeled Is product approved? Draw one arrow from the diamond, labeling it no, and connect it to a circle labeled End of process. A second arrow, labeled yes can lead to the next task in the process.   Place the diamond in the row or ""swim lane"" of the participant who is responsible for that decision. The circle labeled End of process should be in its own row, with no associated participant. There are many other specialized flowchart symbols, but they are rarely used and not typically necessary. Feel free to research them yourself if you feel your document would benefit from a greater variety., Use similar sized boxes and no more than two or three easily distinguished colors, to make the flowchart as readable as possible. For instance, all boxes (tasks) can have blue backgrounds, while all the diamonds (questions) can be yellow.   If possible, have the ""yes"" answer line always start from one side of the box (e.g. the right side, and the ""no"" always in another (e.g. the bottom side).This is not always possible or easy to achieve, so don't spend too much time on it.  , It's better to use multiple pages than to make the flowchart too small to read. Use clearly labeled tabs or arrows to make it clear how the flowchart continues. For instance, draw an arrow labeled A leading off the right-hand side of the page. On the next page, draw an arrow leading from the left-hand side of the page, also labeled A.  , Follow each possible ""route"" through the flowchart and see if it makes sense. Ideally, have someone else familiar with the process go through it with you to catch mistakes and identify missing steps. Once you have looked over it at least once and corrected any mistakes, the document is ready to present or send to other people involved. However, feel free to edit this flowchart if the process changes at a later date, sending the updated document to the people who use it.

There's an incubation period of a few hours to up to 2 days, followed by symptoms that can usually be classified as gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines.The most common symptoms of a salmonella infection are the following:   Vomiting Nausea Diarrhea Chills Fever Headache Blood in the stool Very hot temperature Cold sweats Head cold Runny nose; , While salmonella usually doesn't pose a high health risk, individuals with compromised immune systems, such as people with AIDS, sickle cell disease or inflammatory bowel diseases, are at an increased risk of complications from salmonella poisoning. Children and the elderly are also more likely to experience serious complications. If the symptoms don't seem to be ebbing, and the person experiencing them is in a higher-risk group, it's advisable to see a doctor as soon as possible. Immediate medical attention should also be sought if your or the person you're concerned about experiences the following:    Dehydration, leading to decreased urine output, decreased tear production, dry mouth and sunken eyes. Signs of bacteremia, a condition in which the salmonella enters the bloodstream and infects body tissues in the brain, spinal cord, heart, or bone marrow. A sudden high fever, chills rapid heart rate and an appearance of serious illness are signs that this may be occurring.  , The doctor will assess the your symptoms and in most cases advise getting plenty of fluids and resting until the symptoms pass, since they usually go away on their own. If the doctor determines a test is necessary, a stool sample will be tested to determine whether it contains salmonella. The doctor may also decide to test a blood sample to determine whether bacteremia has occurred. The doctor may prescribe antibiotics if the salmonella infection has spread beyond the digestive system. If dehydration becomes severe enough, the patient may need to be admitted to the hospital to take fluids intravenously.  , Loss of fluids through vomiting and diarrhea creates the risk of dehydration. It is important to replace lost fluid and electrolytes by drinking water, herbal tea, juice, and broth. Even if it doesn't feel good to drink, this is the best way to keep up your body's energy and get past the worst of the symptoms.   Try eating a popsicle, ice chips or some sorbet as a way to get both water and sugar into your system. Drink plenty of water especially after severe bouts of vomiting or diarrhea. Children can drink a rehydration solution like Pedialyte to restore fluids and electrolytes.  , loperamide (Imodium A-D) can help to relieve the cramping associated with salmonella-related diarrhea. However, this medication can also prolong the diarrhea itself., Eating salty or spicy foods can further aggravate your already-sensitive digestive system. Avoid rich fatty foods as well, which your digestive tract may find irritating.  , Lay it over your abdomen to help relieve any cramps you may be experiencing. A hot water bottle, or a hot bath, will also do the trick.  , Overdoing it may increase your recovery time. Your body will naturally fight against the salmonella and it will recover more quickly if you do not put undue stress on it. Take a few days off of work or school if you're still experiencing diarrhea and vomiting.  , Don't eat or drink foods that have unpasteurized milk or raw eggs. This is the most common way people get infected with salmonella. Don't hesitate to send undercooked meat, poultry and eggs back to the kitchen when you're eating out.   Salmonella is most commonly found in animal products, but vegetables may also get contaminated. Be sure to wash all your vegetables before cooking them. Wash your hands and work surfaces after they come into contact with raw poultry, meat or eggs.  , This is another common way that salmonella is spread. Healthy reptiles and birds can carry salmonella on their bodies, and it's also present in cat and dog feces. Any time you handle an animal or its feces, be sure to wash your hands with soapy water.  , Baby chicks, lizards and turtles, for instance, each carry salmonella on their faces. A child cuddling one of these animals could come into contact with salmonella. Since the infection is harder on a child's immune system than an adult's, it's best to forbid children from getting close to animals who could contaminate them.","['hands', 'doctor', 'water', 'animals', 'warm compress', 'reptiles', 'fluids', 'feces', 'children', 'heating pad', 'symptoms', 'body time', 'salmonella infection', 'bland food', 'cook animal products', 'anti-diarrhea medication', 'young birds', 'drink plenty']"
"['spray with commercial squirrel repellent.apply a thorough coat of repellent to all sides of the pumpkin according to label instructions', 'place the pumpkin on a blanket of dog hair', 'use hot pepper or hot sauce', 'surround the pumpkin with vinegar.pour a little white distilled vinegar around your pumpkin', 'try eucalyptus oil']",How to Keep Squirrels from Eating Pumpkins1,"   You may need to reapply the repellent every few days, especially after the rain. Many repellents are non-toxic since they are formulated to drive squirrels away rather than kill them. Most deer repellents will also be effective since squirrels and deers are driven off by many of the same scents. Look specifically for a repellent with large amounts of ""putrescent whole egg solids."" This is, essentially, rotten eggs. Squirrels typically hate the smell of rotten eggs. Be aware that many repellents can have a strong odor, especially immediately after application. The smell tends to dissipate as the spray dries, but in the meantime, you may need to place the pumpkin away from the house.; , The animosity between squirrel and dog is mutual, and many squirrels will stay away from an area if they smell a dog.   Dog hair is also effective at repelling deer. Cat hair may have a similar effect on squirrels, since larger cats can pose a threat to squirrels. It is best to use pet hair rather than pet waste. Cat waste is especially dangerous to use since it is a source of toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection that can cause serious health concerns for pregnant women and people with immune deficiencies.  , Applying a coat of liquefied hot pepper, hot sauce, or powdered cayenne pepper can give the squirrels in your neighborhood a shock once they take a sniff or nibble.   Blend the hottest peppers you can find with enough water to form a liquid. Add a drop of dish soap and a drop of vegetable oil to help the solution stick and pour it into a spray bottle. Coat the pumpkin every few days with this solution to drive squirrels away. Rub a coat of commercial hot sauce over all sides of the pumpkin. You may need to reapply the sauce after a few days or after the rain, but the hot oils have a way of penetrating the skin and soaking into the flesh of the pumpkin. Create a scent barrier around your pumpkin by sprinkling powdered cayenne pepper around it. You can also sprinkle the pepper on top of the pumpkin for added effect. Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling hot peppers. Otherwise, you may irritate your skin or eyes.  ,   The potent smell of vinegar can be over-powering to squirrels since these critters have more sensitive noses than humans. Vinegar is also effective at repelling ants and other insects. You can also wipe the surface of the pumpkin down with a vinegar-soaked rag, but it is best to avoid letting large amounts of vinegar sit on the pumpkin's surface. The acidic properties of vinegar can end up damaging your pumpkin when used in large quantities.  , Dab the eucalyptus oil onto the pumpkin's surface with a cotton ball or spray diluted eucalyptus oil onto the pumpkin with a spray bottle.   In a spray bottle, combine ten parts water with one part eucalyptus oil. Add a drop of cooking oil and a drop of liquid dish soap to help the solution stick before spraying it over all sides of the pumpkin. Note that eucalyptus oil will need to be reapplied every few days. Peppermint oil can also be effective. Both essential oils have potent odors that might be enough to deter squirrels from approaching.

Even if you keep logging in to play RuneScape you will not have as much fun as you would in members and could end up bored of the game more easily.  , Jagex stores a cache on your computer to allow the masses of information in the game to load much faster. Deleting it will not only save you a bit of hard disk space but also make RuneScape more laggy and unresponsive the first time you log in if you can't resist going back.  , Do you play for thrill? Boredom? Whatever it might be there is often a different healthier way to satisfy you. Picking up a hobby is a great way to relieve addiction. To play RuneScape effectively, you should be thinking of it as just a game, not a life necessity. Think about how the game affects you. Look at how it affects others.  , This is quite obvious, but this step can be difficult. Try to catch yourself every time before you get to the login screen.  , You can do this with the Windows HOSTS file, or you may have parental control software you can use or have your parents set.  , That's right. Walk up to someone and give your account away. Not only have you helped someone else, you are no longer that level 100 you were if you ever try to play again. Alternatively, post it online for someone else to use.  , This will keep you from logging in permanently. Should you ever want to play RuneScape again, you would need to create a new account.  , This can include learning to play an instrument, sports, collecting, or travelling. This will take your mind off the game, and more the time you spend away from it, the more free time to concentrate you will have.  , Go to the password change screen, then type a random jumble of letters into the address bar. Copy and paste this into your ""New password"" box. This way you will know your account is gone forever, and there is no way to get it back.  , For example, if you fall in love with mathematics or jogging, you could spend lots of time with it instead of with Runescape. There really isn't much point in just walking away from Runescape or unplugging the internet: you'll come back because your schedule and life is empty. You have to fill it with something useful, something that will take up your time. Of course, if you lack the discipline to do this, you should actively look for help for someone to help discipline you. For example, an awesome example would be if you loved Mathematics and you started preparing for the International Mathematics Olympiad. Then you would find lots of resources online and many instructors to help you. Or you could arrange with your friend to have a special training program so you have a schedule and you train hard for stuff like jogging or studying maths. Once you fill that gap in your life (once you actually have a goal that you want to achieve, that takes up your time and you just love doing it) you shouldn't be addicted to Runescape anymore.

Continue blending the ingredients together until they are thoroughly blended into a creamy texture.       ; , Crack and add one egg into the mixture, and stir it thoroughly. Then, add your second. Once both eggs are blended into the mixture, add a teaspoon (4.93 mL) of vanilla extract. Continue mixing.        , You can use a fork to mix all of these dry ingredients together easily. Once they’re thoroughly blended, add them to the creamy mixture.         The easiest way to do this is to add a bit of the dry mixture, mix it all together, add a bit more of the dry mixture, mix it again, and so on. It’s a slow and steady process!  , If you want to add a little something extra to your oatmeal cookies – and if your arm isn’t completely exhausted at this point – then add in some delicious mix-ins. Common additions are raisins and chocolate chips. You can also add things like cranberries, coconut flakes, chopped nuts, or anything else that sounds good to you.Don’t be afraid to get creative.          If you want to try several variations, feel free to split up the dough into chunks and try all different mix-ins!  , After you’ve created your dough, cover it and pop it in the refrigerator for at least an hour before baking.By chilling the dough, it’ll thicken up a bit before baking and you’ll create really chewy, thick cookies.You’ll have to be patient, but the finished product will be worth it.  , Once you’re almost ready to take the cookie dough out of the fridge, preheat your oven so it will be hot by the time you’re ready to bake. Set your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, or 190 degrees Celsius.It will probably take your oven anywhere from ten to twenty minutes to get hot enough.         , Once your cookie dough has chilled for an hour or so, it’s time to form them into balls. You can use your hands to create the balls, or you can use a tablespoon or an ice cream scoop to do this. Create rows of the cookie dough balls on baking sheets, leaving about two inches of space between them.         If you’d rather have thicker, chewier cookies, leave the dough as is. If you’d prefer thinner, crunchier cookies, flatten out the balls slightly with your fingers or by pressing down on them with a fork coated in sugar.This recipe makes about 24 cookies, although you may make a bit more or less, depending on how big you make the dough balls.  , The exact cooking time is a matter of personal preference, but the general range is about eight to ten minutes.If you like chewier, softer cookies, take them out earlier. If you like your cookies crispier, leave them in for the full time.         , It’s important to remember that while the cookies are still hot, they will continue to bake even out of the oven, especially while on the hot cookie sheet. If they seem a little bit soft or undercooked when you first pull them out, they will likely firm up while they sit. After cooling on the baking sheets for about five minutes, you can transfer them to another surface, or a wire rack if you have one.         If you do not have a cooling rack, you can place your cookies on another sheet of wax paper or parchment paper on your kitchen counter.  , Once they’re fully cooled, you can put your cookies into cookie tins or boxes to give to friends or bring to parties. If you’ve created several different variations using mix-ins, it’s helpful to label what each kind is. Don’t feel obligated to share the deliciousness though! Feel free to keep them all to yourself, and enjoy them with a tall glass of milk.

"['choose the hand for reading', 'identify the four major lines', 'interpret the heart line', 'examine the head line', 'evaluate the life line', 'study the fate line']",How to Read Palm Lines1," In palmistry, there is the notion of an active hand and a passive hand. Your active hand is your dominant hand, whereas the passive hand is the non-dominant hand. The passive hand will indicate inherited traits. This should be read as a baseline. The dominant hand will show any changes from the inherited state from life events etc. If there is a major difference between the lines of the passive hand and the dominant hand, it means that this person has worked hard to develop themselves.; , These are the heart line, the head line, the life line, and the fate line (not everyone has this line).1. The heart line runs horizontally across the top of the palm. It reflects the state of your heart on both the physical and emotional level. 2. The head line runs horizontally across the middle of the palm. It reflects the state of your mind and brain. 3. The life line curves around the base of the thumb, starting between the index finger and thumb. Contrary to popular belief, this line does not actually indicate how long you will live but rather aspects such as strength, vitality, and prosperity. 4. The fate line runs vertically from the base of the palm up the middle of the palm (not everybody has this line). It indicates aspects such as success, career path, and vocation.  , This line can be read in either direction (from the pinkie finger to the index finger, or vice versa), depending on the tradition being followed. It is believed to indicate emotional stability, romantic perspectives, depression, and cardiac health. How to read the line and its specific meanings are as follows:If the heart line starts below the index finger it means that you are picky when it comes to love. A heart line that begins below the middle finger indicates a person who is selfish when it comes to love. If it begins in the middle of the palm, the person falls in love easily. An absent heart line indicates an individual who is ruled by logic rather than emotion. A faint line shows a person who is aloof and places little importance on emotions. A straight and short heart line indicates an individual who is not particularly concerned with romance. A long and curvy heart line indicates someone who expresses emotions freely. A wavy line indicates many relationships and/or lovers, with an absence of serious relationships. If the heart line is straight and parallel to the head line, it indicates that the individual has a good handle on their emotions. A heart line that touches the life line means that the heart is broken easily. A broken heart line or a heart line with smaller lines crossing it can indicate emotional trauma. A chained line can mean depression.  , This represents learning style, communication style, intellectualism, and thirst for knowledge. The specific meanings are as follows:A head absent line indicates a person who is sluggish. A faint line indicates that the individual lacks memory and concentration and is prone to daydreaming. A deep line denotes a good memory, good concentration, and a sensible nature. A short head line indicates a person who is practical and no nonsense. A long line denotes a person that is focused and very successful with a tendency to be selfish. A straight head line shows a person that thinks realistically, is logical, organized, and has a great attention to detail. A wavy line indicates a person who is restless with short attention span. A curved or sloping line indicates a highly creative individual. If the head line begins at the life line, this means that this person is strong-willed. A head line that is separated from the life line indicates someone who has a sense of adventure and enthusiasm for life. A broken head line indicates inconsistencies in thought. Crosses in the line may mean that vital and crucial decisions have a very important effect on the persons fate. Chains or donuts in the head line indicate personal conflict or emotional difficulty.  , It reflects physical health, general well being, and major life changes (for example, cataclysmic events, physical injuries, and relocation). The specific meanings are as follows:If the life line is absent, the person is said to be high-strung, anxious, and nervous. A faint line indicates an individual who has low energy and a life without adventure. A deep line denotes a person who has a smoother life path. If the life line is long and deep, this indicates good health stamina and vitality. A short, deep line shows a person who easily overcomes physical problems. A curvy life line means the person has an abundance of energy. A straight line that is close to the edge of the palm means the person is cautious. A line that runs close to the thumb shows a person who tires easily. If the line swoops into a semicircle, it shows strength and enthusiasm. Lines that are straight and close to the edge of the palm indicate a cautious individual.See if there are multiple life lines. Multiple life lines indicate extra strength and vitality. A break in the life line means a sudden change in lifestyle or interruption. If the life line is broken on both hands, this may indicate a serious illness or injury. Circles in the line or a chained line indicates that the person is susceptible to many health problems and that their life may take them in many different directions.  , This is also known as the line of destiny, and it indicates the degree to which a person's life is affected by external circumstances beyond their control.This line begins at the base of the palm. Its principal features are:A deep fate line means that the persons life will be strongly controlled by fate. Remember, not all individuals have this line. If the fate line starts joined to the life line, this indicates a self-made individual who develops aspirations early on in life. If it joins the life line somewhere in the middle, it indicates a point in mid-life where one's interests must be abandoned if favor of those of others. If the fate line starts at the base of the thumb, this indicates that this person has a strong relationship with family and friends. Breaks and changes of direction in the fate line indicate many changes in life from external forces.  ","['hand', 'life line', 'heart line', 'reading', 'fate line', 'head line', 'major lines']"
"['choose a time', 'plan a theme', 'send out invitations', 'buy supplies', 'purchase the tea', 'buy food', 'decorate the room', 'dress up in costumes', 'put out the tea and food']",How to Have a Tea Party2," Keep in mind the age of the children when planning the time. You should also keep in mind the parents when planning the party, especially if the party is for very young children. Consider things like work for the parents and school for the children. Late morning or early afternoon on a Saturday could be a good time. If possible, ask the parents of the children you’re inviting what would be a good time for them.If the party is for very young children, consider common nap times. Parties at night would probably not be the ideal time for children.  , A tea party for children is the most fun if a theme is involved. If the party is for mostly girls, you could choose a princess theme. An Alice in Wonderland theme is another cute and classic option. You could also choose a theme based on a country, which would be educational and fun. A British theme or Chinese are a couple of options. Research the decorations, costumes, food, and music based on the theme of your choosing.  , Send out invitations based on the theme. You can have invitations printed, or you can send them out via email. You should send the invitations out at least two weeks before the date of the party, though a month before is ideal. If you don’t want to send out custom-made invitations, you can simply email or call the parents of the children.You can find websites that have downloadable invitation templates. Some are free, but others cost money.  , Don’t worry about buying very costly supplies if you will be hosting a room full of children. Small, plastic tea cups and plates will work fine. Again, consider the theme when choosing the tea pot, cups, and plates. You can buy colored or design plates based on the theme. You will also need to buy plastic utensils, a tablecloth, serving trays, and napkins.You can buy tea sets made for children. Many of them, however, are expensive and easily breakable. You can purchase supplies at party stores, like Party City. You can also purchase supplies online. Just make sure you purchase the items in enough time for them to be delivered by the date of the party.  , Children may not drink hot tea, so consider some other kid-friendly options. Sweet tea, apple juice, and other fruit juices are some alternative options. You can still serve the drinks in the tea pot, even if you aren’t serving hot tea.   Consider if parents will be staying when planning the food and tea. If some parents will be staying, buy hot tea, cold tea, and wine.  , Buy food the day before or a few days before the party, depending on the type of food you will be buying. Children may not eat the same things you would serve at an adult tea party, so choose some basic foods. For food, simple cheese, or turkey and cheese sandwiches, muffins, and assorted tea triangle sandwiches with simple ingredients work well. For dessert, sugar cookies, brownies, cupcakes, and fresh fruits with sugar lightly sprinkled on top are some options you can serve.If possible, ask the parents about potential allergies when planning the menu.  , Decorate the room based on theme. Put a tablecloth on the table. Set up the table with small favors, like small toys that the children can bring home. Put out balloons and hang up streamers. Make the room as colorful and cute as possible.For an Alice in Wonderland theme, you could set out the book and place figurines from the story out on the table. For a Chinese theme, put out chopsticks for the food and hang up Chinese lanterns.  , You can ask the children to come in costume, or you can have some costumes set out for the children to dress up in at the party. Even if you do ask the children to come in costume, it is considerate to set out a few costumes for children that may have not gotten the memo. Make sure the parents are aware of the theme if you are asking them to bring their children in costume.  , You can choose to have everything set up before the party begins, or serve it after the children arrive. It is good to at least have some food set out on the table when the guests begin to arrive so that they can snack or drink while waiting for others to show up. Begin setting out the food and preparing the drinks about ten minutes before the children are set to arrive.Make sure to have plenty of napkins available in case of spillage.

"['provide identification', 'provide and teach the use of a litter box', 'keep trying if litter box training is problematic', 'clean the litter box regularly', 'give your cat a cozy place to sleep', 'provide a place to scratch', 'keep your cat inside', 'build your cat an enclosed patio', 'brush your cat regularly', ""remember to clip your cat's claws""]",How to Raise a Cat2," Once you bring a cat home and name it, you should get it some identification. This can be in the form of a tag on its collar, but you can also get it microchipped at its veterinary office. Even if you plan on raising the cat to live indoors, having identification is important -- remember, if it gets out, it will have no experience finding its way home.Your cat's collar tag should include its name and your phone number. Keep this phone number up to date, so that someone who finds your cat can contact you easily.  , When raising a cat, you will need to teach it to use a litter box. For most cats, this is a relatively easy process. Once you bring a cat home, keep it contained in a small space with food, water, a bed, and its litter box. The cat may naturally head towards the litter box to go to the bathroom, as they are naturally clean animals that like to pick specific bathroom areas.As your cat adjusts to its new home and you let it roam the whole house, you should keep the litter box in an area that is easily accessible and close to your cat's daily activity. This will help ensure that the cat actually uses it instead of a handy corner.  , If the cat doesn't use the litter box automatically, move any feces or urine into the litter box and clean the areas where the cat went to the bathroom outside of the box. If the cat smells feces and urine in the litter box, it will know that is where it should go.  , To ensure that your cat uses its litter box, you should make sure to keep it clean and tidy. Remember to remove solids daily. You should also empty it completely, clean the box, and put totally new litter in weekly.If you do not clean your cat's litter box regularly, it is likely to find somewhere else to go to the bathroom.  , When raising a cat you should make sure to give it a cozy place all its own, where it can take a nap or just get some alone time. Typically, this is done by giving it a bed all its own and placing that bed in a quiet and warm corner. This can be difficult to achieve if you live in a hectic or crowded home, but your cat may even pick the spot itself and all you have to do is provide the cushioning.   Many cats love a spot that gets sun from the outside. The sunshine and the view to the outside will likely be very appealing to your cat. Even on a day that is cold outside or when your home is a little chilly, a sunny spot will suit a cat's needs very well., All cats need to scratch once in awhile in order to keep their claws healthy and agile. In order to allow them to do this without destroying your furniture, you should get them a scratching post or scratching pad. If your cat likes to scratch a lot, you may even need to buy or make one for every room.Once you give them this item to scratch, you will need to teach them to use it. To begin with, you can place the scratching post in front of a piece of furniture that the cat has been scratching. You can also show it how to use it by placing your cat's claws on the post. If all else fails, try making the scratching post or pad attractive to the cat by rubbing catnip on it.  , Try to raise a cat to stay indoors, especially if you live in a city. Living indoors greatly increases their lifespan due to lower risks for disease, injury or abuse. It also helps keep wildlife in your area , such as birds, safe and healthy. For entertainment for an indoor cat, provide boxes, cat toys, and sunny window perches for it to lounge in. You may also want to consider having at least two cats, so they can keep each other occupied when you are away.   Make sure that all doors are kept closed and that all windows and window screens are secure if you are trying to keep your cat indoors., If you really want your cat to experience the sights and smells of the outdoors, consider building it a ""catio,"" which is a cat patio. This is an enclosed outdoor area that is typically attached to your home, and which allows your cat to get some outdoor time without letting it roam freely.A catio allows your cat the stimulation of being outside but limits its ability to get lost or kill wildlife in your area.  , Depending on the breed, you may need to brush your kitty more often, but all breeds need to be brushed at least weekly. For example, Persian cats need brushing 3 to 4 times a week but American shorthair cats only need to be brushed once a week. Weekly brushing eliminates tangles and reduces spare hair that would rub off on furniture or floors, or form hairballs in your cat.   Cats do not need bathing unless they get into something really foul and cannot satisfactorily clean themselves off. The exception to this is Sphinx cats, which are bald and need bathing once a week to keep skin oils under control.  , When your cat is young, you should begin clipping its claws every week. This will get it used to the process and will make it less resistant to it when it becomes an adult. Trimming a cat's nails is particularly important if the cat does not regularly go outside, where it might wear down the nails with vigorous activity.   To trim the nails, use nail clippers made for cats, which come in a guillotine type or a scissors type, or human nail clippers. Put the clippers perpendicular to the claws. Trim only the tip of the nail. The quick of the nail, which is the back part of the nail with a blood vessel in it, should not be cut.","['place', 'claws', 'patio', 'use', 'identification', 'cat', 'litter box', 'cozy place', 'litter box training']"
"['think of the simplest route', 'specify distance', 'indicate turns', 'simplify the directions', 'say which side of the street their destination is on', 'warn them about any confusing parts of the route', 'outline the entire route', 'have them repeat the directions to you']",How to Give Directions," Shortcuts may be faster, but they can also be more complicated! If the person is lost or has poor navigation skills to begin with, give them directions with minimal turns. For example: Make a left on Baker street, then a right at the light, and go straight all the way down that road until you get to the highway.; , How far along a particular road does the person need to go? There are several different ways to tell them:    How many blocks or streets they'll pass. This works better in a city than in the country, because in the city there are more cross-streets to count, whereas in the country the space between them makes it easier to lose count, and some driveways look like roads of their own. For example: ""Continue down that street, passing 4 side roads along the way.""   How many traffic lights they'll pass. This is good, but you must be right about the number! For example: ""You are going to pass three traffic lights before the turn.""   Distance in miles or kilometers. For example: ""Go 3 miles (5 kilometers) on Holypoke Road""   How much time it'll take. This is better for when they'll be spending a short time on that path; any longer than that, and your directions will become inaccurate depending on how fast the person drives. For example: ""It should be about five minutes on the highway.""   Give them a drop dead point. A drop dead point is a landmark that tells them that they've gone too far and have missed their turn. For example: ""If you see the library, you have gone too far.""   , If it's not a simple, four-way intersection, give a few extra details. Otherwise, tell them to make a left or right. Give them a street name and one landmark (a traffic light, a particular store). If the person you're giving directions to is good with cardinal directions (north, south, west, east) and/or the city you're in is laid out like a grid (with all the streets perpendicular, running east-west or north-south) indicate the direction, too. For example: ""Turn a left at the traffic light onto Foster, heading east.""  , For example: ""Turn left onto Baker Street"" instead of ""At Baker Street, turn left.""  , For example: ""My house is on the left.""  , For instance, if a lane ends or is right turn only, or a road they need to turn onto is small or hidden, you might want to mention that. If there's a turn that you know people tend to miss, tell them how they'll know they've gone too far. For example: ""The lane is going to merge before the turn, and Baker street will become Forest Street. But you will want to keep traveling down it once it becomes Forest Street.""  , Remember to be concise. Detailed directions are useless if you give so many details that the person driving gets confused. For example: ""Make a left on Baker street, then a right at the second light, and go straight all the way down that road until you get to the highway, it should be about three miles (5 kilometers). Stay on the highway for three minutes and then get off on exit 7. We are the third house on the left. If you see the library, you have gone too far.""  , Whether or not they've written them down, make sure they heard you correctly and understand the route you laid out for them. For example: ""Did you said left on Baker street, then a right at the second light, and go straight all the way down that road until you get to the highway? Get off on exit 7. And it's the third house on the left. But if I pass the library, I went too far."" do not shout at them if they are confused.

"['never bend your back -- keep your chest up and out throughout', 'keep your weight on your heels', 'never your toes', 'keep knees in position', 'do not place the bar on the base of your neck', 'inhale as you drop down', 'and exhale as you come back up', 'warm up to prevent injury', 'do not wear a lifting belt when learning this lift']",How to Do a Squat3," Your spine should be in alignment (i.e.: with your slight natural curve, as if you were standing straight up). Keeping your hips back and chest up prevents a rounded spine. Most people start to get lazy as they get tired, and their back starts to curve. This is dangerous and ineffective. No matter how tired you are, you must focus on your spinal alignment.   A rounded spine can lead to very serious injury. If you can't do a rep right, don't do it at all -- bad form is much worse than none at all.  , You should be able to lift and wiggle your toes if you wanted. Resting on your toes puts stress on your knees, whereas you have a much more solid base on your heels.  , Do not let your knees pull or ""cave in"" while squatting. This is bad for your knees. Actively push your knees toward proper position throughout the entire squat to ensure against bad alignment. You need to keep your knees mostly quiet, bending but otherwise leaving them in roughly the same place throughout the exercise. If you feel extra muscle exertion through your glutes (hips), you are doing it right.          Focus on keeping your knees outward, pushing through the heel, not the toes. Never let your knees extend beyond your toes, as this will increase the likelihood of damage to the patellar tendon and ligament in the knee. Your knees might move slightly forward as you squat, but this is okay -- just keep them over your foot, behind the toes.  , You want the bar to rest on your traps, (upper back muscles). You'll know if it's on your neck if you can feel the bar digging into your neck-bone, as one of your hard vertebrae will be right in the way. Lower the bar a bit and distribute/balance the weight evenly across your upper body.   A slightly wider grip may help.  , This most effectively utilizes your body's natural rhythm, allowing you to access the most air and move through the squat fluidly.          In general, inhale as you ""enter"" an exercise, like a stretch. Then exhale as you exert action.  , As with any athletic endeavor, warming up and stretching is necessary to prevent strain or injury. Warm up first by getting your heart rate up and then following the directions below for a warm up squat, but with a very small amount of weight.          Static versus dynamic stretch: Static stretching is a type of stretch where you hold a position for a certain amount of time (usually 15-30 seconds). Dynamic (active) stretching involves controlled movements through various ranges of motion. Dynamic stretching is sometimes recommended because warming up by moving may offer less risk of injury. Shoulder rolls, light kicks, sumo squats, leg circles, and knee bends are all good examples of dynamic stretching exercises.  Start with no weights at all—or an unloaded barbell, if you're new to squats and weight training. If you're more experienced, or you find an unloaded barbell too light, select weights that are appropriate for your strength and set them up on the barbell. If you have the option of adjusting the height of the rack, bring it to a level below your shoulders, to about your armpits. Do not use too much weight because you can hurt yourself.  , A lifting belt keeps your back supported and aligned with the rest of your body which you need to train yourself to do on your own. However, when you are at a level where your back strength (lower and upper) is sufficient, a belt may be desirable in order to brace the back and core for heavy lifts.

"['talk to your friends and associates as practice for more serious advocacy', 'take advantage of social media', 'become a content creator', 'join a group', 'reach out to the decision makers']",How to Help Decrease Poverty2," Approach your friends, family, and acquaintances about issues you’re passionate about. Your goal should be to make them care about that issue. Think about their experiences, sympathies, and temperaments so you can craft an appeal that’s most likely to succeed.For example, imagine your uncle is a police officer in a poor area. The issue you care about is education. If you want to get him to care about education in the same way you do, talk to him about how lack of educational opportunities contributes to crime. You could open by saying something like this: “You know they just cut funding for afterschool programs in Sandtown? Better get ready to start chasing kids all over the city. Kids with nothing to do get in trouble.” It’s easier to influence someone’s opinion about a new subject than it is to change their mind about something. Talk with them about unfamiliar subjects or approach new subjects in unfamiliar ways.  , Social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook can be a great way to raise awareness of an issue. These tools allow you to reach large audiences with relatively little effort, and numerous issues have gone viral (achieved notoriety quickly) with the aid of social media.Use social media to promote articles, videos, and memes that tackle any one of the many facets of ending poverty.   While the reach of social media is broad, its effect is often shallow. Even though it’s a great way to spread a message, social media alone usually doesn’t produce lasting change. Over-reliance on social media risks creating a lot of “slacktivists,” or people who are constantly hitting the “share” button to spread a message, but take no action beyond that., If you want to take your advocacy one step further, create content that tackles issues relating to poverty. “Content creation” is a broad term, but all it really means is creating any type of media—whether it’s audio, video, visual, or written. In order to publish your content, you can create your own platform or contribute to someone else’s, depending on the effort you can devote to it.Podcasts, blogs, and YouTube are all great ways to publish your message. You can create your own blog, podcast, or YouTube channel if you think you can attract an audience and you want complete control over messaging. See Start Your Own Podcast and Start a Blog to learn more. There are a lot of ways to publish your content on someone else’s site but they’re all going to boil down to two basic methods:You can give them what they want, or convince them to accept what you’re offering. Search the blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels that you think would make a good platform for your message, and ask them their policies on submissions. Either they’ll ask you to create something about a certain subject, or they’ll want you to pitch them on something you’re working on.  , Many voices together are more powerful than one voice alone. By joining a group that’s concerned with the same issues you’re concerned with, you’ll gain credibility and access.   For instance, if your particular concern is poverty among working women, you can join a group like 9 to 5, which lobbies and advocates on that particular issue.As a member of 9 to 5, you’ll gain credibility when you talk to others about poverty among working women. Saying, “I’m a member of 9 to 5, and we lobby and organize on behalf of issues of special concern to poor and working women,” has a much better ring to it than “You know what I think?” Plus, 9 to 5 already has a newsletter, a website, and a blog. What better way to spread your ideas about poverty and working women than broadcasting them to a group you already know cares about that issue?  , Be an advocate by taking your message to people who have the power to make the changes you want to make. With a problem as big as poverty, there are a lot of decision makers and a lot of ways to communicate with them. For example:   You can write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper, your congressman, senator, mayor, or other political figure.Call your elected representative. Start an online petition (that you spread through social media). Since one voice might not be enough, let the decision makers know just how many people care about the issue you’re passionate about. Change.org is one of the best known places to create an online petition, but it’s far from the only one.If you gather enough signatures, invest the money and time in printing out a hard copy. Hand delivering a stack of papers with 30,000 signatures is more visually impressive than sending an email with an attachment.

If your paper is about a science topic, you'll want to interview a scientist in that field. If your paper is about a period of history, you'll want to interview either a historian or someone who's lived through that period of history. If you plan to make your essay an opinion piece, you'll likely want to interview someone who has a strong opinion about the topic covered in your essay. Ideally, you want someone who can express opinions articulately, and who also has credentials in the area you plan to write about. If your piece will have a narrow perspective, you'll need to interview only one or two people. If your piece will present a general consensus, you'll need to interview more people, probably with varying expertise and credentials.; , In order to conduct an effective interview that can in turn become a successful interview essay, you need to delve into the history and background of your subject(s) and the topic at the core of your essay. You can use this information to determine the best questions to ask in the interview.When available, read works about and works written by your subject, both in print and online. At the same time, research the topic associated with your subject. The more you know about both, the more intelligent questions you can ask. Look for previous interviews your subject has given, as well. These will give you an idea of what questions the person has been asked before, so you can decide on appropriate subjects for your own questions, including questions that no one else has asked. Questions that require ""yes"" or ""no"" answers are good for gathering specific factual information; open-ended ""how,"" ""why,"" and ""tell me about"" questions are great for gathering additional background material not found in your research. Draw up a list of the questions you are prepared to ask. Have more questions ready than you will likely use, so that you can make adjustments as the interview takes place. (For instance, your subject may begin focusing on what you thought was a side topic, but turns out to be the key part of your interview.) Rank your questions in order of importance to make sure you ask your best ones, or list them all in the order you'd ask them and color-code the most important ones.  , You'll need to contact the interviewee (or his or her representative) to arrange a time and place to conduct the interview. You'll also need permission to record the interview with either audio or video equipment, or to take photographs. Be sure the person you contact knows who you are and why you want to interview him or her.Choose a quiet place with few distractions for your interview site. A library, restaurant, or campus location if you're doing this for a college writing class would be suitable. You may want to get the interviewee's consent to use his or her comments in your essay in writing, as well as permission to record those comments during the interview. By law, if you are recording an interview conducted over the phone, you must obtain written permission.It's helpful to have a backup interviewee in case the person you plan to interview can't make it. Be on time at the place you've agreed to meet for the interview.  , Even if you are using a recording device, take notes during the interview, as they can help you look for specific points in the recording to incorporate into the essay.Using a recording device (with permission) is almost always advisable, as it permits you to save your note-taking for jotting down your insights on contexts, themes, how your subject approaches the questions, his/her comfort level, and so on. Be patient and respectful as you ask your questions and wait for responses. Give the interviewee time to reflect, and you will likely be rewarded with more insightful answers. A few deeper responses are usually better than many superficial ones. Immediately after the interview, write down your thoughts and impressions about the interview and interviewee. They may help you shape the essay. Always end the interview by thanking the person.  , If the essay is a class assignment, the format will likely be pre-determined. Clarify with your instructor whether he or she expects questions and answers, long quotations, or paraphrasing, and if the primary focus should be the interview itself or in placing it in a larger context.Generally, interview essays can be in one of several formats:   Narrative format. This form allows paraphrasing of some information the interviewee says, along with direct quotes for the material you most want to emphasize. This is the most likely format for a class assignment, and offers the most opportunity to add context and analysis. Conversational format. This is a looser format than the formal writing style required for most essays. You can address the reader directly and use both first and second person. This format can be suitable for anything from class assignments to magazine articles. Question-and-answer format. This form presents your questions to the interviewee, followed by the interviewee's responses. (That is, the text looks something like this: (Your Name): How long have you been in the circus? (Interviewee's Name): About 35 years.) These are always direct quotes, although you may insert explanatory material in parentheses and substitutions, such as a person's name in place of a personal pronoun, in brackets. This format is best suited for essays with only a single interviewee or a closely related group, such as spouses or the core cast of a TV show.  , The outline will depend largely on the essay format you are following, but a strong introduction, which clearly identifies your subject and the goals and focus of your interview, is always important.Read over your interview notes and listen to any audio / video recordings you have. Utilizing both whenever available will allow you to thoroughly consider both the highlights of the interview and the most significant themes to emerge from it. These, in turn, will inform your outline of what information your essay will cover and how it will appear.One possible outline could be an introduction that starts with an anecdote about the interviewee and then presents your thesis statement, several key points that support the main focus, and a conclusion that summarizes the information presented. Traditional school essays often utilize a five paragraph format (introduction, three supporting paragraphs, conclusion), and this can often work with interview essays as well.  , If the purpose of your essay is only to present your interviewee to your reader, your thesis will likely be a brief summary identifying the person and his or her background, accomplishments, and qualifications. For instance: ""John Doe eagerly volunteered to serve his country in Vietnam in 1967, and is fortunate to still be here to share his story.""   If, however, the purpose of your essay is to use your interviewee's comments to support a position or examine a larger theme, your thesis will probably be a statement of that position or theme, with the interview / interviewee placed within that context. For instance: ""John Doe's mixed feelings of pride and betrayal reflect those shared by many Vietnam veterans still with us."" Regardless of essay format, make your thesis clear and concise, and be sure that the remainder of your essay refers back to it. See How to Write a Thesis Statement for more advice.  , The body of your essay needs to follow the selected format while supporting the thesis and providing substantial coverage of the actual interview.   Interviews can sometimes produce a good deal of repetitive answers (even with high-quality questions), so you may need to trim repetitions and unnecessary elements from the body of your essay. Make sure that whatever material you do keep remains true to both the spirit of the interview and the overarching focus of your essay.A handout from the Writing Center at the University of North Carolina (available at http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/oral-history/) provides a wealth of valuable materials on interview essays. It includes, for instance, examples of how to utilize the same interview materials in a transcription (question-and-answer format), a presentation of individual experiences (quotations and paraphrases), and the placing of the interview / interviewee in a larger context (paraphrasing and quotations with ample explanation).  , Any type of essay, including interview essays, should be thoroughly proofread and carefully revised to provide maximum clarity and impact.   Reading over the essay yourself is a good start, but it is always wise to have another set of eyes look it over as well. Another reader is likely to catch errors, repetitions, and unclear sections that you have glossed over.Go back to your original interview notes, recordings, and transcripts, and make sure that your essay continues to reflect the actual interview. Layers of editing and revising can sometimes cause the essay to drift away from the original source and intent. You may even want to let the interviewee read it over to ensure that it captures his or her voice., Depending on your assignment, you may not need to explicitly cite the interview itself, but always check to make sure. Always cite any supplemental materials, however.Any materials you used for research, information about the interviewee, or context for the essay itself should be referenced in the approved citation format for your essay. Make sure one more time that any direct quotations from your source are placed in quotation marks, and any paraphrasing is done without quotation marks. Don't put words in your subject's mouth, and respect the words that do emerge from it.

You should have at least six months’ worth of income saved to cover periods of potential unemployment. Be sure to set beneficiaries on your retirement and insurance plans, too. If you separate from your partner, don’t forget to change your beneficiary list.  , Are you still both increasing your savings? Do you have enough saved to cover an emergency? Are you both still comfortable with the way expenses are being shared? Talk to your partner about these and other related issues.   Make budgeting and financial planning an activity you do together. This can be more successful or even exciting if you are both working towards a common goal, such as a vacation or purchasing a home. Always be honest about your finances. If you are struggling financially, you should admit to your partner that you’re having money problems. That way they can help you out by either loaning you money, helping you find another job, or taking other action that can help. Encourage your partner to be honest with you about their spending habits and their happiness with your current financial arrangement. If your partner lies about money matters, you should seriously consider ending the relationship. Don’t let your partner push you into a purchase you can’t really afford.For instance, if you can’t afford a new car but your partner really wants you to have one, stand firm and insist that you will not make such a purchase. If they love you, they will respect your decision.  , Only move in together if you’re truly in love with the person and ready to be in close proximity to them night and day. This will make splitting finances just one part of your relationship, and not its entire basis.  , It’s okay to borrow money in an emergency situation, but don’t make a regular habit of it.   If your partner regularly asks to borrow money, you should inquire as to why they constantly need money. They may have lost their job or have unpaid debts you don’t know about.  , The last thing you want to do is end up saddled with debt that you did not personally incur. Only make a large investment with your partner like a house or car if you are in a stable, long-term relationship.You should ask your partner about any debts or liabilities that they may hold. Be honest about your own debt as well. Keeping these secret can ruin a relationship when the debt is discovered by the other partner. Always put both your names on the lease, mortgage, or loan. This will allow you some degree of protection in the event you and your partner separate. For mortgages, consult a real-estate attorney to help you figure out the best way to negotiate your local real estate laws as they relate to your relationship. A married couple has different options for taking out a home loan than an unmarried couple. For auto loans, too, you (and your partner) should talk to a financial officer at your local bank or credit union. There are many variables that could impact whether you and your partner decide to take out an individual loan or cosign the loan. Seek advice relevant to your living situation in order to get the lowest interest rates and avoid shared debt.  , Common assets include bank accounts as well as big-ticket items. Typical material assets include houses, cars, and boats. These items should never be purchased using both your names. Otherwise, you might end up wrangling over ownership in the event you separate.   Bank accounts, likewise, should never be shared between you and your partner. These accounts can be a source of tension should one partner decide to use the money for themselves. If you want to set up a shared account with your partner – for instance, an account either of you can use to pay bills – keep it completely separate from your personal account. Put a small amount of money in it each month along with your partner, and use it only to pay the bills you intended it for.

It is not as flashy or intuitive as other recovery programs, but it is one of the most powerful free data recovery solutions, and works on virtually all operating systems.   PhotoRec can be downloaded from the CGSecurity website. Ensure that you are downloading the correct version for your operating system.; , PhotRec is a lightweight program, and does not need to be installed. Instead, open the ZIP file after it is downloaded and copy the folder to an easy-to-access location on your hard drive, such as the root of C: drive or your desktop.  , Double-click on the ""photorec_os"" file in the TestDisk folder. The os part of the name will be replaced with whatever version you downloaded. For example, if you are using Windows, the file will be called ""photorec_win"".  , Ensure that the SD card has been inserted into your computer's card reader, or that it is inserted in the camera and the camera is connected to the computer via USB. When PhotoRec starts, you will be given the option to choose which disk you want to recover data on. Use the arrow keys to select your SD card.   If you have multiple partitions on the disk, you will be asked to select which partition you want. Most memory cards aren't partitioned, so you won't need to choose.  , You are given a few options before the recovery process starts. Most users can leave these at their defaults, but if you want to recover files even if they are corrupted, you can enable that on this screen.   Enabling ""brute force"" will recover fragmented files, and is very CPU intensive.  , By default, all of the file types are highlighted. If you know exactly what files you are looking for, you can narrow it down to speed up the search. Each extension in the list has a brief definition next to it to help you determine what kind of file it is.   If you are recovering for a camera, you will want to focus on RAW and CR2 files, as well as JPG  , PhotoRec will need to know what file system type the memory card has. Most memory cards are formatted in one of the systems in the ""Other"" category.   If you aren't able to get any results, try running the scan again with the other file system option.  , PhotoRec will give you two options for space checking: Free or Whole. If your memory card is corrupt, you will get better results with the Whole option. The Free option will only look for files that have been specifically deleted.  , The last thing you need to do before you start scanning for files is set a location for recovered files to be saved. You will need to select a location on your computer and not on the memory card you are trying to recover from. Use your arrow keys to change directories.  , You can see the scan results update as the scan is performed. PhotoRec will make at least two passes on the card to try to find as many files as possible. This will take several minutes.  , After the scan is complete, the recovered files will be available in the directory you set before the scan started. The original filenames will almost always be lost, so you will need to manually change them back to whatever you want.If the files you need are still corrupt, there is likely no way for them to be fully recovered.

Depending on the results, you may need shots, tablets or capsules, or fortified foods to change your levels, or you may be just fine but need to keep an eye on your future health and B12 levels to ensure that they don't fall.   Talk to your doctor about possible options but recognise that unless your doctor is sympathetic to your choice of diet, you may be given information that doesn't suit your dietary choices or that even suggests you are not healthy. If that's the case, look for a new doctor who will take your veganism into account objectively and work with you, not against you.; , Vitamin B12 is considered to require a higher dosage for older persons than for younger persons:   2 micrograms a day for young people 25 micrograms or more per day for people over 50.The Vegan Society makes a general recommendation of 10mg per day with a once-weekly B12 supplement perhaps of 2000mg but fails to provide an indication of age appropriateness.  , You will read a lot of opinions promising you that it isn't possible to get ""proper"" B12 from plant food sources and that you're doomed to dementia, anemia, or something worse.That kind of dramatic conclusion can either lead to you rebelling and not bothering to do anything at all, or worrying too much that your balanced, healthy diet is not good for you. When you know already that it is. The reality is that B12 is in many fortified foods that you can consume and it's actually a very rare deficiency.   The amounts of vitamin B12 thought to be needed for good health would be hard to get from food alone, and it is thought that it is better absorbed from supplements anyway.Just be sure to find dairy and animal-derivative free supplements from a reputable supplier. Don't be complacent, however. Being reassured is about knowing that if you actively care for your body's nutrient needs, then it will be a lot better than neglecting them. Vitamin B12 is important for your brain, nervous system, and red blood cells. And the risk for deficiency increases as you age., There is a range of food available, although it varies from country to country. Always read the ingredients and if you're not sure, contact the supplier or the manufacturer for concise nutritional information. Some items that may be fortified with B12 include:    Soy milks, and other non-dairy milks Energy bars like Clif and Luna Cereals Brewer's yeast and nutritional yeasts but only if fortifiedYeast spreads, such as Marmite. If you don't like the taste, you can just put a small spoonful in sauces or other foods to hide the taste.

In order for your branding to seem authentic and be effective, you need to project a truthful image of what your company strives to provide. But before you can do that, it’s important to articulate your company’s mission so that you’re clear on what sets you apart from the pack. Think about the following questions:   Why did you start this business? What goals do you want to achieve? Who are the people you want to help? What makes your company different from others in your field?; , Aim for your customers to think of your brand almost like a living, breathing person they can trust. They need to know that your product or service is the one they should turn to when faced with a dozen choices in the grocery aisle or a long list of names in the phone book. Taking your mission into account, decide what type of attitude you want to project. What spin are you going to put on your mission?   Maybe you want your product to be seen as the ticket to an adventure or a brand new life or a second chance at youth. This approach is often taken by upscale food companies that sell products like goji berry juice or sprouted grain granola bars. Maybe you want to present your brand as smart and cutting edge. Being seen with your product will make customers feel cool, like they’re in a special club. Brands like Urban Outfitters and Apple take this approach. Another approach would be offering your customers a reliable, completely trustworthy option that will never let them down. This is a good approach if you’re selling a product that should never malfunction, like tires, or if you’re building a brand for your law practice. You could also rely on nostalgia to build your brand. People feel connected to things that remind them of childhood and carefree times.  , When you buy a product, why do you buy it? What makes you choose a particular brand? See if you can use your answer to help you figure out how your own brand will come across. Find out what your customers are longing to feel and make your brand help them feel that way. Do they want to feel powerful? Responsible? Conscientious? Smart? Unique? Your brand needs to evoke this feeling with all of its copy, marketing, and design. Cue these feelings not only with language, but with colors and product design as well.  , Choose a catchphrase or slogan and some key words that you want to be associated with your brand. The words should be closely aligned with your mission statement, and memorable enough for people to repeat to each other and recognize next time they read them. Use your brand language not only in the copy of your products and advertising, but also when you discuss your business and make contacts in person.   Keep your text as streamlined and basic as you can, because it will be more memorable that way. A good example of this was the tagline Apple was using for much of the '90's and into the 2000s: ""Think Different"". This worked on multiple levels, because it painted the brand as smart and unique, and the concept was easily slipped into discussions and other branding platforms. Two words: ingeniously effective branding. All copy associated with your brand, including what appears on your product’s label, on your website, and in advertising materials, should match the tone you’re trying to project. For example, your company is meant to be seen as trustworthy and comfortably old-fashioned, use slightly formal language that will make your customers feel that the people who run your business are as dependable as their third grade teacher.  , Your brand needs a look that’s in keeping with the tone of your brand mission and language. Are you modern and sleek? Fun and colorful? Traditional and classic? This look should be synchronized across all of your media (brochures, website, product, offices, etc.).   Design a great logo. Your logo will also be used to help embed your brand in your customer's mind. When someone sees a check mark, they think Nike, even if there is no other branding. Your logo must be well designed (so hire a professional) and you should use it frequently and place it prominently. Choose the colors that will represent your brand. These colors will be used as often as possible on promotional materials to help evoke your brand. Examples include McDonald's gold and red, Google's red, yellow, green, and blue, or wikiHow's green and white. Remember to keep things simple. You want your branding to be easily recognized and quickly remembered. The best way to do this is to be unique but also to be simple. You might want to get legal protection for your visual branding and any distinctive phrases you use to describe your business or your offer.  , Communicate the importance of your brand to your employees and explain why and how you arrived at the brand identity you are promoting. You will need their support for your new branding to be effective.   Remember that everything your business does is linked to your brand in the eyes of the customer. This includes the way your employees dress and behave. Your employees will have their own idea of what your business stands for and whether it is delivering on its promises, and they’ll provide invaluable insights along the way. Ask your employees how they believe your product is being received on the market, and don’t discount their opinions.  , If your messaging sounds good but you don’t deliver on your promises, your customers will go elsewhere, and your brand won’t catch on. But if your business delivers what your branding promises, you’ll gain your customers’ trust. Before long, they’ll start spreading the word about your quality of service, and your brand’s reputation will soon speak for itself.   Make sure that your customers’ association with your brand lines up with what you’re actually offering, too. For example, if you promise that your margarita flavored lemonade is the most refreshing drink on the market, but your customers routinely complain that they took a sip and were surprised it didn’t contain tequila, there’s something off about the way you’re pitching the product. You might want to rename the drink so that customers don’t feel let down when they try your product. Being transparent about your business practices is essential, too. Trust is a really important part of brand recognition, because of your customer's need to feel like they know your brand like an old friend. Let your customers see how you work, where your money goes, and what your real priorities are. Even if the information isn't always the best, it should at least be true and painted in the best possible light.  , What's the age group and demographic of your main customer base? You might be surprised at the answer, so it’s important to conduct some research to find out who’s interested in the product you’re offering, and how they’re responding to your branding.   Consider running a focus group so you can test out how your product is received by people from different demographics. Ask them to describe their perception of your product before and after trying it. Targeting a specific demographic is often more effective than trying to be universally appealing. You might find that you’ll decide to narrow your focus after learning who’s buying your product. For example, if you find that teenage boys are the most likely group to buy your snack mix, you may want to change your branding strategy to make your product even more appealing to this demographic.  , Conduct research to find out what other companies are offering and decide how your company is different. Your branding should focus on the difference, on what makes your product better than the rest. Finding that special something that sets you apart is essential, because your customers have so many choices that they’ll never even know your product exists unless you help it stand out.   You might find that a certain company has already cornered a particular segment of the market, but that doesn’t mean that your product won’t appeal to a slightly different demographic. If you find that the market is saturated with great products, consider pivoting in a different direction. Either change your branding approach or tweak your product.  , It’s important to interact with the people who buy your product. Not only will they give you essential feedback on how your business could improve, but it’s a way for them to feel that they know your brand and what it stands for. Represent your brand's values in how you talk and how you act, and constantly give your customers room to give feedback and ask questions so that they get the chance to get to know and eventually trust the brand.   Respond promptly to feedback when you receive it. If someone complains, make sure to hear him or her out and resolve the issue to address the person’s concerns. Avoid using automatic replies to emails. Try to make your business seem as personable and friendly as you can. Let your customers see your enthusiasm and your excitement about your product.  , Have a plan in place to get your brand name in as many stores and in front of as many people as possible. Depending on the product or service you’re offering, you might want to consider taking out ads online, in newspapers, in magazines, and wherever you might find new customers.   Apply your branding, including your visual brand and brand messages, to all of your materials—from packaging, signage and stationery, to your website and marketing materials. Don’t be shy about boldly branding your products and displaying them in as many venues as possible. You want your brand to be everywhere people look. Advertise your brand in unexpected places. Radio advertisements, employee uniforms, and freebies with logos (such as tissues or pens) are all relatively inexpensive ways to promote your brand. See if you can get publicity from a local newspaper, TV station or blog who will review your product or service.  , Social media is one of the best ways to build a brand these days. Get basic social media accounts and update them regularly with pictures, deals and other information about your company. Find things that are related and appeal to your customers and give them the chance to interact.   For example, if you're a travel company, post a picture of a beautiful location with a message something like: ""Counting down the weeks to summer vacation and some time to unwind! Where do you want to travel this year?"" Do not become spam. Avoid constantly pushing your brand in an annoying way or without context or to people that have no interest. Stay out of your customer's recycle bins. Be real and conversational, not a metaphorical sleazy car salesman.  , This is the age of the Internet and social media, so having a website is central to building a brand. It's fine to base your business in the flesh and traditional media, but if you don't at least have a website, you'll be seen as old fashioned and inaccessible. Hire a professional or use a template and get a nice looking website. This should, at a minimum, discuss what your brand is about, where your offices can be found, what your hours are, and how you can be contacted.   Use your site as an opportunity to tell your story proudly. People have an easier time understanding something that fits into a story, and they'll especially identify with things that let them feel like they're a part of that story. Give your customers a story that they can be a part of if you want to build your brand into a big name. Publish it on your website’s “about” page or distribute it in your publicity materials. For example, in the '80's and '90's, Microsoft painted themselves as a company that pulled themselves up by their bootstraps in order to become the most innovative and effective product in their field. This resonated with business-oriented individuals, who wanted to see their own lives in the same way and who could feel apart of that spirit of greatness by buying Microsoft products.  , Having an in-person presence helps to build trust and spread the word about your brand. Throw events, attend events put on by others, do volunteer work, and be civically active. This is a great way for your customers and potential customers to see what your brand stands for.   Street fairs and other daytime events often provide opportunities for businesses to set up a table and hand out information. Take advantage of this opportunity to forge bonds with people in your community who could potentially be customers. Giving back to your community through donations and sponsorships is another good way to get your brand out there. You could sponsor a little league team or a girl scout troop to build up your community presence.

Both might be in the same unit as in a window unit.The evaporator is inside the building to intake air and exchange the heat in that air to the cooled evaporator coils -- and they in turn cooling the air to be recirculated into the conditioned air space. This part called the ""cooling unit"" can seen inside the building (indoors part of a window A/C unit, for example).       The condenser is outside to disperse collected heat into the exterior air. That is the ""radiator"" like coils that are on the outdoors (back, of a window unit, for example). This may be a standalone box-like fixture with the compressor, louvers and grill like vents -- and its job is sending chilled water or compressed refrigerant (such as freon) to the evaporator through tubing or pipes (some systems use highly toxic ammonia as refrigerant, instead of safer freon).        , It is usually located in a convenient place, easily accessed (in a wall, mechanical room door or a ceiling for example). This maintenance is crucial, because when the filter is clogged the system becomes inefficient. If a system were ever operated with a torn, ill-fitted or missing filter -- the evaporator could become clogged with dust and fungi, and ducting could become dirty and all require extensive cleaning.  , The thermostat is the control inside the house that allows you to make a setting for ambient temperature (air temp) and select the air flow option inside your home. If this is broken, controlling the air temperature becomes impossible. This may mean that your air conditioner stops running entirely, it runs continually, or it works in rough starts and stops. Either way, it can end up costing you a lot of money, which is why it gets fixed so often.  , Refrigerant is a compressed gas that cools down the air by being pump through your A/C condenser and evaporator. There is supposed to be a certain amount of refrigerant inside your air conditioner at all times. When it gets low, your air does not get cooled down quite as much as it should.  , There is usually a pipe connected to your air conditioning evaporator unit that drains all of the condensation water that builds up while it is running. If the pipe is not draining correctly, water can leak on your floor, in attic space/ceiling, basement or on your roof. This can cause a lot more problems if not detected quickly and repaired (window A/C units usually drip outside, directly below the widow unit).  , The fan motor is what draws in the fresh or recirculating air through the cooling coils to cool down the air. If this is not working correctly, then your home will not be near as cool as it could be.  , If your air conditioner is making more noise than usual, it may be because your air compressor is becoming worn out. This means that noise is increasing, which can be annoying. This is why noise is a common air conditioning repair problem.  , In some cases, the electricity running through your air conditioning unit can overwhelm the fuses located in your breaker box on in the A/C unit. Having someone come out and look at the electrical circuits for the air conditioning equipment is an important choice -- so you do not end up hurting yourself.  , If necessary, contact a professional or ask a friend who knows more about home/appliance repair than you do.

"['forgive yourself for your mistakes', 'create a daily practice of authenticity', 'practice mindfulness', 'commit to making the change', 'spend quality time alone', 'monitor your progress']",How to Stop Being an Attention Seeker2," Even though it feels bad to dwell on mistakes we’ve made, many people replay those things over and over again in their heads. Allow yourself forgiveness, and see what you can learn from your mistakes.You can’t change the past, but you can learn valuable lessons from it. Tell yourself how great it is that you’ve learned something new and can change the way you do things in the future. If you remember certain times that you acted in an attention-seeking way in the past, forgive yourself for those things, too. The fact that you can acknowledge those behaviors means you can work to prevent them in the future. Talk to yourself kindly, the way that you would to a friend having a difficult time. Say to yourself, ""I know I messed up that time, but I was doing my best in the moment. Everyone messes up sometimes. It's okay, and I'll try to do things differently next time.""  , Choose ways that you want to practice being authentic each day. This can mean doing something that you enjoy by yourself, or reciting an important affirmation to yourself.Practice being yourself and acting in a way that feels genuine, without worrying what people will think. You can make a practice of doing one thing each day, when you feel that you’re being true to how you feel in the moment. This could mean saying something honest that you haven't before, such as, ""Actually, I don't like going to that cafe very much."" It can also mean doing something differently, such as wearing an outfit that's comfortable, even if it's not stylish. You can develop personal affirmations to help you accept yourself. You can say something like, “I am a valuable, lovable person the way that I am,” or, “I accept and love all aspects of myself even as I work to grow and change.”  , Mindfulness refers to trying to stay present wherever you are, without getting lost in thoughts or feelings that take you out of the moment. Mindfulness is most often practiced through meditation techniques. However, there are many ways to practice mindfulness.You can find books or websites that offer meditation techniques, or visit a meditation center to find guidance on how to begin meditating. If meditating isn’t right for you, practice mindfulness by noticing the physical sensations you’re experiencing. If you start to get distracted by guilt, shame, or unpleasant memories, just notice the feeling of your clothes on your skin, or your feet on the ground.  , It is almost impossible to make a change in ourselves if we don’t consciously commit to doing so. If you want to change or eliminate your attention-seeking behavior, make a commitment to do so, and to take specific steps toward that goal.Write down your commitment. You can put it on a calendar, marking the day you commit to start working on it. Write down daily or weekly goals, such as, “I will meditate for five minutes each day,” or, “Each week, I will volunteer 5 hours of my time to a charitable cause.” Tell someone else about your commitment. Tell a trusted friend or family member. They can check in on you to see if you’ve followed through on your commitments.  , If you're an attention seeker, you probably try to spend lots of time with other people. Practice spending time by yourself, too. Set a goal for how much time you'll spend alone each day or week.   When you're alone, do things that you enjoy. This will help being alone feel more fun and enticing. You can read your favorite books and magazines, walk around your favorite park or neighborhood, or dedicate time to a favorite hobby. It may be uncomfortable to spend time alone at first. However, push through that discomfort and you'll begin to cherish the time you get by yourself.  , Once you have a practice for making positive changes, take time to reflect and see how you're progressing. You can do this by writing in a journal, asking for feedback from someone you trust, or simply taking some time to think back on the past day or week.   Be gentle with yourself as you progress. Making big changes in yourself doesn't happen overnight. Praise yourself for any positive changes. Give yourself credit for the work you've done. Say to yourself, ""Great job. You've really been doing your best at this, and it's working.""  ","['change', 'mistakes', 'progress', 'authenticity', 'quality time', 'practice mindfulness', 'daily practice']"

Children are keenly aware when the adult around them is not interested in what they’re doing. Try a pop-up book if you’re unsure how to pick something fun.   If you find that the kids are not paying attention, or you just want to avoid losing their interest, try selecting a few books, two or three should suffice, and have the kids vote on which one they want to read. You can’t please everyone, but you can work the runner-up story into the next storytime.; , The book you choose should be appropriate for the age group and appropriate with regard to content. If you’ve been tasked to read to older children, books like Everybody Poops may not be the best selection. Instead, try something in the Dr. Seuss line, or the classic Incognito Mosquito.  , Regardless of the age group, make sure you read the book yourself a few times. You can think about possible questions the kids might have, think of fun ways to read through the book, and also find a natural rhythm or cadence that fits the pace and tone of the book.  , Pick different stories for each reading. If you read the same story again and again the kids are likely to get bored. What’s more, reading a variety of stories will expose the children to a breadth of vocabulary, plots, and diversity, specifically in the types of language. In other words, your little ones will have ongoing experiences with different syntactic forms (sentence and phrase structure), sounds, verb tenses, and emotions., You’ll lose part of the audience if they can’t hear you. Also, they won’t be able to pay attention if they don’t know what’s going on.   Please remember that there is a difference between talking for all to hear and yelling a story at the kids. Avoid the latter by testing the room’s acoustics beforehand. You can do this by reading to another adult or even by turning on the voice recorder on your phone and placing it in the middle of the room.  , Kids need structure and learn this through interaction. Before you start reading the story, be sure to reinforce a few simple rules like, “don’t interrupt the story” and “raise your hand if you have a question.” As you read through the story, you’ll likely need to restate these simple rules several times, but do it calmly and politely.   If you happen to be interrupted, you can try to a polite phrase like “I see your hand, please wait your turn” or “I’ll call on you when it’s time for questions.”  , Whether it’s a book about a caterpillar or the three little pigs, there is always room for fun. As you preview the book, come up with some different ways to read each character’s lines, using vocal expression. You might change the pitch of your voice from low to high, speed it up or slow it down, or add a voice effect like talking in a whisper or creaky voice.   Also, you’ll likely find that making faces helps too, and can be quite natural. You can also try to act out a specific word, like saying “scared” in a scary voice, or saying “happy” in a cheerful tone. Remember, it’s your job to make the grumpy old man in the book sound even grumpier!, You don’t have to read to the kids in an emotionally sterile environment; make the reading area fun and interesting to be in. You can add comfortable rugs, and throw in some over-sized pillows or bean bag chairs. Also suggest to the parents that the kids bring their favorite comfy blanket if the story is around nap time. You might kill two birds with one stone., If you find yourself reading too quickly and blowing through the story, the children and the parents may not be able to keep up and you could lose your audience. Practice your rate of speech in advance and time the story. You’ll find that you stay on track better by making yourself aware of your own voice.   It may be a good idea to take a slight pause of 2-3 seconds as you turn each page. This will add an equal amount of spacing at regular intervals and slow your rate of speech appropriately.  , You can involve the kids by showing them all the pictures in the book. Seeing the pictures help kids understand the book better in addition to keeping everyone's attention. As you show the each picture, you’ll need to ensure that you are catching each member of your audience. To do this, sit comfortably so you can easily turn to show the book to the left and right sides of the room., Another way to engage the group is to ask what the children would do at specific parts in the story. For example, while reading The Three Little Pigs, you might ask the kids “Who would open the door for the wolf?” or “What would you build the house out of?” The responses may be surprise you in witty and clever ways.   You should try to ask just a few questions near the middle of the story, and again at the end. Don’t ask too many questions too often or it may break up the story and you’ll lose continuity.  , Try adding a prop to the story for the kids to use as you read. For example, hand out egg shakers for the kids to shake when something specific happens, like thunder rumbling or when a character skips. This will bring the children into the story and make it more fun for all.Also include some stuffed animals that look like the characters. So you would bring a stuffed wolf or turtle for the kids to act out some scenes. This also serves as a great way to extend the children’s imaginations.  , Immediately after the story, ask the kids what their favorite parts were. Take it to the next step and have them make up what will happen next. This is perfect to spark creativity and keep them reading.Asking the children follow questions can be very useful. Try asking a question that requires limited or guided output like “Who remembers what the hungry caterpillar ate?” or “What happened to Humpty Dumpty?”You’ll also get a good idea of who was paying attention, in addition to checking their comprehension skills.

MFA programs are a good way to spend two to three years focusing solely on creative work and give you the space to grow as a writer. You will be surrounded by other writers and get a chance to connect to a larger writing community. You may also find mentors in your professors and faculty members who are writers themselves, allowing you to feel supported by their guidance and knowledge.Keep in mind you do not need an MFA to be a successful writer, as some publishers are not partial to writers with an MFA. You are not guaranteed a book deal at the end of an MFA program. If you view an MFA as your only shot at being a legitimate writer, you may want to reconsider your expectations for the degree.Many successful writers do not have MFAs but some do and the value of the degree will often be more personal than professional. Though your chances of landing a teaching position in a writing program may increase if you have an MFA, you will still need to work hard to have a career in teaching creative writing. Having an MFA is a benefit to landing a teaching position, but it is not a guarantee.; , Though you may end up applying to only MFA programs that offer full funding or partial funding, you will still need to pay for the cost of living, books, and school fees. If you do not get into a funded program, you may end up footing most of the bill for tuition, which can be in the thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars. You should be prepared to take out loans to pay for the MFA or have a large amount of money saved up for tuition.You should look over your finances, paying close attention to any savings or investments you may have. You should be prepared to take out loans to pay for tuition in the event you do not get funding and do not have enough saved to afford school.  , Ask yourself, Do I need an MFA to fulfill my goals as a writer? Will the MFA offer me something I cannot find or create on my own? Considering your current resources as a writer and how an MFA to add or improve upon them is an important step in the process. You want to be sure that the MFA will help you fulfill your goals as a writer and feel worth your time and money.Perhaps you are already a member of a local writing group, but you feel an MFA will help you take your writing to a higher level. Or maybe you have published a few short stories and are working on several different writing projects, but think that an MFA will improve your craft and give you the time to work on these projects. Consider how the MFA will provide you with opportunities that you cannot create outside of school or a program. If the MFA seems necessary to your goals as a writer, it may be worth pursuing.  , Ask yourself it you are willing to move to a different state, province, city, or town for the MFA. If you are all for relocating, you may research MFAs based in institutions across the country. If you would prefer to stay in your city or state, you may look at local and state institutions to see if they offer MFA creative writing programs.If you do not want to relocate for the program, but you are not interested in programs in your area, you should look into low-residency programs. Low-residency programs allow you to complete your degree without spending time on a particular campus. You will work with faculty members to send and revise work while only having to spend one to two weeks a year on the campus.Low-residency programs are also a good option if you have professional or personal commitments that you cannot move away from, such as a professional career or a family. Many writers also choose low-residency MFAs for financial reasons, as they do not have to factor in the costs of relocating to go to school.  , Because there are so many MFA programs in the country, you may start by looking at the top ranked programs. You can find top MFA creative writing program lists online to get a sense of the “best of the best”.You may set your sights on schools that are highly regarded in the literary world and see if they are a right fit for you.Keep in mind that thought an MFA program is highly rated, it does not necessary mean it will suit you. You may have other considerations, such as where you want to live in the country for two years as well as how much money you can afford to spend on school. You can view a complete database of MFA creative writing programs at Poets & Writers.com.  , You can also look up where your favorite writers teach, if they do teach, and consider applying to schools where they are full or part time faculty members. Getting the opportunity to take classes and learn from your favorite writers may be a good incentive for you to apply to certain programs.However, you should check to see if your favorite writers are full time faculty and how often they teach in the program. Some bigger name writers may not teach very often in a program or spend very little time actually mentoring students, as they may be occupied with writing their next novel. Ideally, you want faculty that will spend one-on-one time with you and mentor you., A big part of doing an MFA in creative writing is being able to afford the program. You should look for programs that offer full or partial funding to writers who are accepted and prioritize them, especially if you are not financially prepared to pay your own way through school.Often, fully or partially funded programs only accept a small number of students every year, another plus if you’re looking for one-on-one instruction with a certain writer or instructor. Having smaller class sizes can end up being more of a benefit than having a superstar writer as a teacher, as your work may get more hands-on instruction and attention. You may set your own person limit on how much you are willing to spend on your MFA. You may then have a hard line on applying for programs that only offer full funding or try applying for a mix of programs that offer full funding, partial funding, and no funding.  , If a certain MFA program does not offer funding, you may check for other sources of funding or financial support through the institution. This could be a teaching assistant (TA) position, where you assist a professor and get paid for your services by getting your tuition costs covered by the university. You should also look into a graduate assistant (GA) position in another department or a mentorship program where you mentor undergraduate students in exchange for tuition remission.   Landing a TA position or a GA position can also allow you to get valuable teaching experience. This may be useful later if you plan to pursue a career teaching in higher education, as you can show employers that you have teaching experience at the undergraduate level. You may need to contact the financial aid or scholarship office at the institution for more information on other funding options.  , You should also review the classes that are offered in the MFA program to see if they are of interest to you and relate to your writing. Look for a program that seems to speak to your interests and goals as a writer, as it will likely be a better fit overall.For example, some programs offer classes in hypertext or new media and they encourage interdisciplinary studies, where you can take classes in other genres like poetry or non-fiction. Some programs are more traditional, offering only workshop classes and seminars around certain craft elements in writing.  , You should also check to see if the MFA program offers other perks, such as visits to the program by literary agents, which could increase your chances of getting published. The program may also have guest teachers and visiting writers who run workshops and seminars for students, which could be a perk if one of the visiting writers is someone you would like to work with and learn from.   Some programs also have higher publishing rates for their graduates and are renowned in the literary world for the high caliber of their graduates. You should look for a program that fits your budget and your needs, but also consider the other perks offered by the program.  , You should speak to writers who are currently in the program as well as writers who have graduated from the program. This will help you get a better sense of the program as a whole and have an informed idea of what it is like to be a student in the program. Current and former students may also be able to offer advice on how to apply for the program as well as how to find housing once you have been accepted to the program.You can request contact information for current and former students through the program’s applications page or the program’s prospective student contact. You should send a list of questions to these students to help you get some perspective on the program. You may ask, “What has your experience been like in the program?”, “How has the program improved your writing?”, and “What is the most positive and least positive aspect of the program?”  , You should also reach out to writers who are on the faculty of programs you are interested in applying to. You may be able to find their contact information on the program’s website or through the prospective student’s office at the institution. Talking to faculty members will help you get a better sense of the teaching style in the program.Reaching out to faculty members can also allow you to see how responsive and in touch they are with student requests. If the faculty member appears friendly and full of information and interest, this may be a good sign. Ideally you want faculty members who appear dedicated to their students, even prospective ones.  , You can also get a better sense of the MFA creative writing program by arranging a visit to the campus. This is especially important if you are planning to relocate to a new city or town for the school. You want to be sure you can handle living in the new city for at least two to three years and feel comfortable on campus.You may set up campus visits before you apply for MFA programs or once you have been accepted to a few programs. Either way, a campus visit is a good way to get a sense of the institution and what your standard of living will be like if you choose a particular program.

"['give yourself a goal', 'develop a meal plan', 'remember to include fibre every day', 'do not forget to include nutrients from beverages']",How to Calculate Carbs3," Before you can do any planning, you need to determine what your goals are. Do you want to maintain your weight, but maybe make healthier choices? Do you want to lose or gain weight? Take the number of calories you currently consume per day as a starting point and work to determine the number of calories you will need to consume in the future to meet your goals.   Remember that it takes a reduction of 500 calories per day (on average) to lose one pound per week.For most people, this reduction can come from carbohydrates. Remember not to cut down any macro-nutrient group too low. Avoid cutting back too far on protein and healthy fat as both as used from repair and hormone production. Example: Say your current caloric intake was calculated to be 2,000 per day. You want to lose some weight, so you decide you need to cut back to 1,500 calories per day to do that safely. In order to maintain a healthy diet, 40-60% of those calories need to come from carbs. To make things easy, let’s assume you want to have 50% of your calories come from carbs. Multiply your daily calorie goal of 1,500 by 50% to get 750 calories per day from carbs. Now divide the 750 calories per day by 4 (as there are 4 calories in every carb) to get 187.5 grams of carbs per day. You now have your daily caloric and carb intake amounts., Using your calculated number of calories and carbs per day, start making yourself a meal plan. Use nutritional labels on food packages and the USDA’s Super Tracker (https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/default.aspx) to help you determine the number of calories and carbs in each item you include in your plan. The Super Tracker is also a great online tool to make a plan, as a ton of nutritional information is already included.The Super Tracker will also remind you that daily exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.  , You should try to eat something with at least 5 grams of fibre at breakfast, to start your day. Half of the grains you eat every day should be whole grains. Eat breads that have at least 2 grams of fibre per serving (a bread serving is normally 1 slice). Substitute whole gran flour for white flour when baking. Add fresh or frozen vegetables to foods like soups and sauces. Add beans, peas or lentils to your soup or salad.Add unprocessed wheat bran to cereals to increase the amount of fibre. Try brown rice, wild rice, barley, whole wheat pasta, and bulgur as opposed to the “white” versions. When substituting whole wheat flour for white flour when baking bread, you may need to add more yeast or allow the dough to rise for a longer period of time. If baking powder is part of the recipe, increase it by 1 teaspoon for every 3 cups of whole grain flour. Apples, bananas, oranges, pears and berries are great sources of fibre and can easily be eaten as a snack. Nuts and dried fruit also have a lot of fibre, but some dried fruit may be high in sugar.  , Everything you put in your mouth, even gum, can contribute to your daily caloric intake. Beverages, however, may be the most forgotten or overlooked. Water doesn’t have any calories, but it’s about the only beverage you don’t have to worry about. And while coffee or tea on their own may not be high in calories, you do have to count the milk, cream or sugar you put in them. In general, sugary drinks are the worst culprit. Non-diet soda, energy drinks, juice and added sugar in tea and coffee will add your calories up very quickly.Remember that fruit juice is not the same as eating a piece of fruit. Consuming the same calorie level of juice vs. whole fruit does not mean that those two foods are equal. In whole fruit, fiber is included which helps to regulate the blood sugar spike that comes with consuming carbohydrates. Juices have little to no fiber causing them to spike blood sugar. Choose whole over juice.  ","['meal plan', 'beverages', 'goal', 'nutrients', 'day', 'fibre']"

These are both known as androgenic alopecia because both are dependent on levels of the hormone androgen, which is responsible for hair on the scalp, face, chest, underarms, and genital regions.In men, the hair loss occurs at the front of hairline and on the top of the head (the “bald spot”). In women, hair is thinned all over the scalp, but more at the top of the head. Women usually don’t get bald spots.Androgenic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss. Though far less common, congenital hypotrichosis is a group of genetic conditions with little or no hair growth. These may be due to single or multiple gene defects.; , Environmental causes can lead to what’s known as telogen effluvium (TE), which is the second leading cause of hair loss. The telogen phase is the resting phase of hair growth. If, for any reason, the number of hair follicles in the active, growth phase drops, TE can result, and a person would notice more shedding, usually by noting more hair than usual in a comb or brush. You might also notice more hair loss during bathing or on a bath towel. TE can develop in three ways:   An environmental “insult” stuns or shocks the hair follicles, and they stop growing. This type of TE is usually temporary as long as the triggering event is temporary, and normal hair growth returns within 6-12 months. If the environmental “insult” is more persistent, more and more hair follicles enter the resting state, and there will be a slow, but constant loss of hair. A third type of TE may or may not be due to an environmental stressor. In this type, the hair follicles go through shorter hair-growth cycles. The result is thin scalp hair and shedding short hairs, which are very thin. The environmental stressors can be many. Some short-term stressors include postpartum alopecia (after giving birth), physical trauma (an accident, a fall, or a broken leg, for instance), vaccinations, crash dieting, or medications, especially antidepressants. More persistent environmental stressors that may lead to more persistent TE include nutritional deficiencies (iron, zinc, B-vitamins, lysine) and chronic stress.  , Anagen effluvium is a rapid form of hair loss due to an interruption in the anagen (or growth phase) of your hair. The most common causes are cancer chemotherapy and poisonings (such as heavy metal poisoning). Once chemotherapy ends, or when the poisoning has been treated, hair growth returns, though not always as before. Some people experience a change in hair color or type—changing to curly from straight or vice versa.  , Alopecia areata (AA) is believed to be an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the hair follicles. Hair loss can be sudden and most often happens on the scalp in patches. If the entire scalp is affected, it is called alopecia totalis. If the entire body is affected, it is called alopecia universalis. If it is limited to the beard area in men, it is termed alopecia barbae. Different forms of AA are seen in men, women, and children. AA may go into a spontaneous remission, or it can be persistent.   Conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (Lupus or SLE), discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) and sarcoidosis are other autoimmune conditions that can lead to hair loss.Folliculitis and seborrheic dermatitis are two examples of inflammatory skin conditions that can cause hair loss. If you notice any overly dry skin or red, acne-like rashes around the site of the hair loss, then contact your doctor for a diagnosis. Many of these conditions can lead to scarring alopecia, which occurs when scar tissue results in irreversible destruction of hair follicles. This can be the result of a chronic disease (SLE) or various forms of folliculitis.  , Certain viral, bacterial, and fungal infections (such as HIV, late-stage syphilis, and ringworm, respectively) can also lead to hair loss.When ringworm (a group of common fungal infections with no actual worms involved) occurs on the scalp, it results in patchy hair loss called tinea capitis.   There are a number of fungal organisms that can cause tinea capitis, including Microsporum audouini, Trichophyton tonsurans (especially in Latin American countries), Trichophyton schoenleinii, Trichophyton megnini (Southern Europe and Africa), and Trichophyton violaceum (Middle East).  , Drugs such as antidepressants, acne medications, anticoagulants (blood thinners), anticonvulsants, cholesterol-lowering drugs, beta-blockers used in glaucoma or heart disease, anti-fungals, anti-gout medications, anti-inflammatory drugs, and medications used to treat Parkinson’s disease, ulcers, and thyroid disease may all have hair loss as a side effect., If you suffer from muscular disorders (muscular dystrophy) or glandular conditions such as hyperthyroid (overactive thyroid), hypothyroid (underactive thyroid), either low or high adrenal function, or diseases of the pituitary gland, then you may also experience hair loss as a result., Certain hairstyles (tight pigtails and corn rows, for instance) and chemical or physical treatments (curling irons, perms, hot oil treatments, hair color products) can encourage hair loss.Keratin-treated hair (also known as Brazilian Blowout or Brazilian Keratin Treatment) has been reported to cause hair loss because of the presence of formaldehyde-like chemicals in the products.In August 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent a warning letter to the producers of many such products citing both safety and labeling violations.","['conditions', 'genetic factors', 'hair', 'growth phase', 'side effect', 'hair style', 'medication labels', 'stress levels', 'recent events', 'infections', 'hair loss', 'chemical interactions', 'inflammatory conditions', 'diseases']"

Never overlap the cable; 5) Don’t leave large gaps between the mats. Your feet will be able to tell!; 6) If your mat is undersized, give priority to the areas where you’ll be standing barefoot most often.  ,, up in the wall near where the wiring leads from the mat will terminate. Run new wiring to the box from the circuit breaker panel or - if the mat is small - from a nearby outlet (consult manufacturer's instructions for more information about wiring requirements).  , Notch the bottom plate to accommodate the two conduits that will contain the power lead and the wires for the thermostat-sensing bulb.  , Select tile that’s at least 6 in. square so each tile will span two or more sections of cable. Smaller tiles are more likely to conform to the minor hills and valleys of the cable when you tamp them in place, creating a wavy surface.  , Use hot-melt glue to additionally secure the mat. Don’t leave any humps or loose edges; you’ll snag them with your notched trowel when you’re applying the thin-set mortar. ,, electrical metal tubing (EMT) that are long enough to run from the floor to the electrical box for the thermostat. Fish the power lead cable through one length of conduit. Hot-melt glue the power lead into the groove. Fish the thermostat wires through a second piece of conduit, then weave it 12 in. into the mat, keeping it equidistant from the cable on each side. Nail metal protective plates over the notches in the bottom plate to protect the wires and cable where they pass through.  , Use the flat side of the trowel to press the mortar firmly through the mat and into contact with the cement board. You can establish a flat, uniform layer by lightly floating the trowel across the tops of the cable, then use the notched side to comb the mortar to create ridges; a 3/8 x 1/4-in. trowel works well for most tiles. Again, lightly skim your trowel over the cable. The sheathing on the cable is tough, but you still need to avoid any “sawing” type action or jabs with the trowel. It takes a little trial and error to get a flat layer.  , Do two resistance tests while installing the tile to ensure you haven’t damaged the cable. (If the resistance test fails, see the manufacturer’s instructions to find the problem.) Once the mortar has dried, grout the joints.  , Use a programmable thermostat so the mat will only come on when it's needed. It costs more initially but will save energy and money in the long run.
