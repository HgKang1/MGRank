["determine the exact placement of the mantel shelf above your fireplace. most fireplace mantel shelves are placed 50-60 inches above the floor. when positioning your shelf, make sure to think about the combustible height. since wood is a combustible material, there are codes and guidelines that must be followed when placing a mantel over a combustible chamber, such as a fireplace. if a mantel is 10\" wide, the minimum distance from the top of the fireplace is usually 19\". for an 8\" wide mantel, the distance is 17\", and for 6\" it's 15\".after levelling the shelf, draw a line on the wall that corresponds to the edge of the mantel. make a mark in the direct center of your fireplace. you want to make sure your mantel isn't one-sided. , the cleat is what holds the mantel shelf to the wall. the mounting board should be long enough to fit the width of your shelf. measure the length of the cleat. then, using that measurement, find the center line and mark that on the cleat. you will line this mark up with the mark you made on the wall in step 1. the top of the cleat needs to have an angled edge, not a straight edge. take a saw and cut a 45 degree angle lengthwise along one edge of the cleat. this is what the mantel hangs on. dry-fit the angled edge of the cleat into the mantel. make sure they fit snugly together so that the mounting board will support the mantel. if you do not want to saw an angled edge, you can use a flat edged cleat. make sure your cleat is wide enough for the mantel to be fastened to the cleat with screws. , dry-fit the mounting board into the mantel. using a tape measure, measure the length from the top edge of the mantel to the bottom edge of the cleat. draw a second line beneath the line drawn on the wall from step 1 using the measurement you just took. if you do not want to measure the two pieces together, measure the length of the mantel and the length of the cleat. add those two measurements together to determine how far to draw the second line beneath the first line. , when you hang a mantel, you want to make sure that you hang the object on the studs. for a mantel shelf, you will probably have 3 studs.the easiest way to find a wall stud is to use a stud finder, which can be purchased from a local home improvement store. in most houses, studs are spaced 16\" apart. studs are usually 1.5\" in width. when you attach the shelf to the stud, you need to drill or nail into the middle of the stud, which is 3/4\" from the edge. if you don't have a stud finder, try finding an electrical outlet on the wall. one side of the electrical outlet will be nailed to the stud. to locate which side the stud is on, use the heel of your", "at least two sims will be needed for this and will certainly suffice, but if you want more, you can have more. , the lot must consist of at least one closed in room with a door so sims can be locked in. the room must be at least a 4x4 to ensure there will be enough room., the first cheat you will enter is \"testingcheatsenabled true\", without the quotations. keep in mind that while caps don't matter, spacing does. the second cheat you'll need to enter is \"buydebug on\". note: this cheat will only work with a stuff pack or expansion installed into your game. , under tomb objects is a stone sarcophagus, (a coffin holding mummies). under miscellaneous are two fancier sarcophagus'. place the sarcophagus of your choosing into the designated room, being sure not to block the door. then, under tomb objects is a special torch. under the lights you can find a torch but this torch is different because it's also a lever. note: the lever needs to be outside of the room for the murder to work. , this is where it gets tricky. hold down the keys ctrl + shift and click on the sarcophagus while holding down those buttons. not too hard right? a list will come up asking you different things. click set mummy chance and then select always. note: the set mummy chance option may be under the option more at the top of the list. now, when the sarcophagus is opened a mummy will come out. next, shift + ctrl + click the torch lever and select enable lever. now your sim has the ability to pull the lever. , it wouldn't be murder if your sim accidentally opened the tomb. but there's a way to fix that problem. ctrl + shift + click the torch lever again. now select link triggers and add link trigger, then select pull lever. now ctrl + shift + click the sarcophagus and select link to activated behavior. select open. to check it was done properly, simply click one of the objects. a pink or green line should appear, connecting the two. this means there was success., give the victim the queue to walk into the room. then click on the door and select lock and everybody. you need your game fully updated to do this, if your game isn't fully updated or you can't get it to work simply go into buy mode and remove the door. your victim has now been locked into the room., have your murderer sim now simply pull the lever, releasing the tomb mummy on your sim's victim. the mummy will walk out and most likely curse the sim with the mummy's curse, which will kill the sim if not cured. if your sim victim wins the fight or survives, simply repeat the process until they are cursed., yes, sadly you do have to wait for this one, but they will die. what makes this murder is the fact your sim's actively participating in the murder by pulling the lever", "be the first one to take action: severe allergies are considered a disability under american law, and you can be an ally to your friend by treating the problem as a serious issue of access.; , some people get uncomfortable, itchy eyes and skin; others have severe asthma attacks that can send them to the hospital. don't assume that allergies aren't real or that your friend can just take a benadryl before coming over. ask your friend if he or she minds talking to you about their allergy and explain that you're trying to understand more about how to change your habits. learn about the symptoms, and support your friend in learning more about his or her health by visiting an allergist. if there's a kind of cleaning or air filtering you can try to make your house accessible to your friend, try it! , how many of their other friends and family have pets? how many people can they visit aside from you? try to understand how your decision to get a pet will, or did, make your friend's life more restricted, and consider how much she or he relied on your home as a place to hang out and connect with their social scene. , see whether some of your pet-free friends would mind hosting extra dinners, brunches and parties so that your allergic friend can come too. talk about whether you can occasionally use other friends' homes as \"emergency\" places to meet the allergic friend, even if the homeowner isn't there (in cases of breakups, crises, or other times when you or your allergic friend really want to see each other and not in a public place). you could even consider splitting the cost of \"renting\" a friend's pet-free living room or spare room for a small amount (someone who needs the cash!), getting a spare key, and using that as a home-away-from-home every so often for you and your allergic friend. , how do they feel? give the friend a chance to be angry and sad, and take their feelings seriously - while you do love your pet, your decision to have it in your home is keeping a beloved human out of your home. this can be especially sad if you're very close and/or have known each other for a long time. don't let them feel like you're just paying lip-service; let them know that their reactions and worries are changing how you approach the situation. act on what they say. come back with ideas and thoughts on how to adjust. ask them for their own ideas. , do it more often than you would have pre-pet, since no one succeeds in making contact, or making plans, every time they try. try to actually talk to your friend and see your friend as much as you did pre-pet, even if it means harassing them a bit (in a friendly way, of course!) your friend will be much happier if you harass them for hangout time than if they have to harass you. let them know you still", "most cats are naturally a little skittish about having their paws handled, so begin by helping your cat get accustomed to it.wait for a time when your cat is relaxed and lounging. begin gently petting its paws while simultaneously petting the cat in its favorite spots (the back of the neck, under the chin, where its back meets its tail, etc.). do this for each paw you plan to trim. the cat might pull its paws away, or even get up and walk away. let it go; don't force it to do anything, but continue to gently pet its paws when you have the opportunity. whenever you handle your cat’s paws, reward it with treats and praise to help build positive associations.; , once your cat is comfortable enough to allow you to rest your hand on its paws without pulling away, start to gently hold its paws in your open hand. place your hand over the cat’s paw, then flip your hand around so the bottom of the cat's paw is on the palm of your hand. keep rewarding the cat with petting and treats; give the cat a new, special treat that will only be associated with cutting its claws. , after your cat grows accustomed to you holding its paws, start holding the paws and massaging them with your fingers.gently massage your fingers over the tops and bottoms of each paw you plan to trim. reward your cat with more treats and praise. , eventually, you should be able to gently squeeze the paws (applying most of the pressure on the pads) to push individual claws out without upsetting your cat.when your cat’s claws are extended, you’ll see the thick part of the nail, and, towards the cat’s toe, a pinkish area inside the nail, called the quick. the quick is the living part of the nail and contains blood vessels and nerves, so cutting a cat’s nail to the quick is quite painful for the cat. never cut a cat's nail close to or with flush with the toe; your aim is to clip off only the sharp point.look carefully at where and how large each quick is--through a clear nail it will look like a small pink triangle. each of your cat’s nails will be similar, so even if the cat has dark nails, look to find one clear nail as a reference point for the others. , if you're going to be trimming the cat's nails by yourself, the cat will need to sit on its rear on your lap, facing away from you, while you hold its paw with one hand (and, eventually, the clippers with the other). practice having your cat sit this way and hold each of its paws. gently press on each nail to extend it. again, reward the cat with treats and praise.if you have someone to help, they can hold the cat facing you, or they can cradle it, while you hold the paw with one hand (and, eventually, clip with the other). practice having your assistant hold your cat", "going to the gym during peak hours may cause you to feel more self-conscious because there will be lots of other people around. instead, try going to the gym during off hours, such as late in the evening or early in the morning. ask a gym employee what the peak hours are at your gym so that you can avoid them. if you prefer to exercise outside, then try exercising at night or early in the morning when fewer people are out., you might feel self-conscious if you don't know how to use the machines or if you are not sure what exercises to try. to deal with this type of self-consciousness, try setting up a meeting with personal trainer at your gym. a personal trainer can teach you how to use the machines properly and help you develop a set of exercises that you can do when you come to the gym.many gyms offer a free one-on-one consultation with a trainer so that you can learn how to use the machines. ask at your gym if they offer something like this. , if you have just started working out, then it is normal to feel a bit self-conscious. you are doing something new and that can cause anxiety. that is why it is important to give yourself some time to adjust to the new activity before you decide that it is not for you.for example, if you have just started working out at a gym, then give yourself a few weeks to adjust to the new environment and people. if you are just starting an outdoor exercise program, it may also take a few weeks to feel comfortable walking around your neighborhood. , it is normal to feel self-conscious, and many people experience these feelings. even people who seem like they are totally comfortable at the gym may be feeling self-conscious. try to remind yourself that people are more focused on themselves than they are on you.even when you are exercising outside, people passing by in their cars or on foot are likely thinking about their own problems and are probably not paying much attention to you. , if you struggle with jealousy when you are at the gym, then this may be feeding your self-consciousness. to combat jealousy, try to focus on what you admire about the fit people at your gym.for example, when you are feeling jealous of someone, you might think to yourself, \"wow! i admire her ability to do so many pull-ups. she must be incredibly strong!\" or, \"amazing! he has been running on the treadmill since i arrived at the gym! i admire his endurance.\" , if you feel so uncomfortable at your gym that you dread going to it, then it might not be the right gym for you. consider looking for a different gym if you still don’t feel comfortable at your gym after a few weeks.try looking for a gym that caters to your needs. for example, if you are a woman, then there are gyms that are for women only. or, you", "you must first understand what you did wrong in order to change it. define the mistake. did you say something wrong? did you accidentally make a mistake on a project at work or at school? did you forget to clean the bathroom like you promised? understand how and why you made the mistake. did you do it on purpose and then later regret it? were you simply not paying enough attention? think to yourself something like, \"how did i forget to clean the bathroom? did i not want to clean it and avoid it? did i get too busy?\" if you are not sure what you did wrong, ask someone (friend, family member, teacher, co-worker, boss) to help you find out. for example, if someone is upset at you, you can ask,\"i sense that you are upset with me, can you explain?\" this person may then say, \"i'm upset with you because you said you would clean the bathroom and you didn't do it.\"; , are there other times when you forgot to do something? write down any patterns or themes you notice that keep coming up for you. this may help you identify a larger goal that you need to work on (attention span, certain skills, etc). for example, perhaps you tend to forget tasks that you don't want to do such as cleaning. this could indicate you are avoiding the task or that you need to become more organized in order to remember to complete certain responsibilities. , understand that your mistake is your own. take the responsibility that is yours and avoid blaming it on someone else.if you play the blame-game then you cannot learn from your faults, and you may continue making the same mistakes over and over again. write down the parts of the problem that you contributed to, or the specific mistake you made. identify things you might have done differently to produce a better outcome. , one of the best ways to solve a problem or mistake is to identify how you have solved similar problems or mistakes in the past. think thoughts such as, \"i have remembered things in the past, how did i do that? oh yeah, i wrote them down in my calendar and checked it several times a day!\" make a list of similar mistakes you've made. identify how you dealt with each mistake and if it benefited you or not. if it didn't then it probably won't work. , in the current example, there are many options: you could clean the bathroom, apologize, offer to clean another part of the house, negotiate, plan to do it the following day, etc. use your problem-solving skills to think of possible solutions to your current issue. create a pros and cons list for each possible solution. for example, if you identified that one possible solution to your issue of forgetting to clean the bathroom is to make sure to clean it tomorrow, a pros and cons list might look like this: pros - the bathroom will get clean eventually, cons - it will", "if you don’t trust yourself to change then no one will do it for you. real change has to be driven from your own desire to be better, feel better, and have a positive outlook on life. change can be scary, but it you love and trust yourself you can get through changes unscathed. think of prior big changes in your life. are they really scary in hindsight? how well did you handle the changes? what can you learn from them?; , a positive outlook on life and the future is paramount to enacting change. you need to first change how you look at yourself before you can change. think of it this way – if you want to change your love life to become more open, you’re not going to get very far if you believe “i don’t deserve to be in love.” erase this negative language from your mind by practicing positive refrains every day, like: “i love myself,” “i can do this,” “i am capable of changing.”don’t punish yourself or get upset if you have a negative thought. instead, replace it with an opposing, positive one. if you thought – “women never like me,” counter it with “i haven’t met a woman who i am compatible with yet.” , even if your goals aren’t related to your body, being healthy and happy will make it much easier to focus on changing yourself for the better. make sure that you are eating a balanced diet, getting 6-7 hours of sleep a night, and doing things you love to erase stress., don’t judge yourself or get upset at your faults. this is the time to look at your behaviors through a neutral lens, figuring out exactly what about yourself you want to change. there is a reason you want to change, and you need to do some exploring to find it. having clear motivations will make it much easier to change. some questions to ask include: does this make me happy? what are the facts, not the feelings, about this situation? why do i want to change? what is my end goal? , this needs to be specific and goal-oriented. by setting smaller, more manageable goals you “trick” your brain into thinking the task is easier, making it easier to commit to your project. for example, you might want to reform your love life and become less shy. setting small goals makes the larger idea, “change your love life,” seem less daunting. step 1: think about what you want in a partner. what attracts you? what doesn’t? make a list. step 2: think about what caused relationships to fail in the past. start going to the gym, clean up your house, or focus more on work to improve your chances at love. step 3: commit to going out to bars and social events at least once a week, or make an online dating profile. step 4: ask one person out for a casual date. no matter what the answer, brush it off and keep trying. , if you are trying to", "for example, learn where your cheek bones are and where your hairline is. this will help with further steps.; , you may need a sighted person to assist you with this. an in-depth list of products you might want are listed in the things

apply them. wash your face. do what ever you usually do with your face. , ideally, a table. place any protective items on the table. also, it may be useful if you place something you don't mind getting messy on your clothing., this may be difficult. first. if you use a liquid foundation, tip the bottle slightly so that a few drops come out. make sure it's not too much. gently spread the foundation between your fingers. then apply in this way: circular motions on chin. circular motions on cheeks. small circle motions on nose. circular motions from nose to temples. circular motions on forehead. small circular motions under nose. don't apply too much in this area as it tends to lie here. make sure you rub your foundation in well. , if you use a powder, either a foundation or for over the top of your foundation; you will need to apply this correctly as well. first, get your powder brush and get some powder on it. gently spread this on your face. wait until you believe it has covered your whole face and then rub it in, but not too much. , smile big and feel just under your eyes. when you feel the apple of your cheek, your cheek bone, drag your blusher brush from here towards your ear. blend your blusher slightly by gently rubbing it in but don't let it get too low on your cheek. ideally no lower than the bottom of your nose. , this is extremely difficult, but with practice, you will get the hang of it. get some eye shadow on your applicator. then place the brush on the inside of your right eye. gently drag the brush from the inside to the outside of your eye. do this as many times as you would like and until you think it's covered your whole eyelid. repeat on your left eye. , this is only for advanced makeup appliers. pull the mascara applicator out of the bottle. do not pump the lid; this gets air in to your mascara and makes it dry out very quickly. next, place the pad of your finger on the very end of your applicator. open your eyes. gently place your finger against the bridge of your nose. pull the mascara brush up your eyelash until you think that you have enough. transfer over to the other eye. note, you don't have to switch fingers; just place your same finger on the far left side of your eye. remember to wipe off your finger with a makeup remover wipe. give", "in general, there are two overall types of beans: shell beans and snap beans. both types can grow in either the pole- or bush-style, but the pods of the beans are what make them unique. shell beans are primarily removed from their pod to be eaten, and are consumed fresh or dried to save for later. snap beans are eaten inside their pod, and are only eaten fresh (not dried for later use). you can grow multiple styles of these beans directly adjacent to one another, because bean plants are self-pollinating and won’t cross-contaminate each other. popular shell beans include black beans, fava beans, black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, and kidney beans. popular snap beans include snap (green) beans, adzuki beans, mung beans, asparagus beans, and scarlet-runner beans.; , pole beans are a type of beans that are vining and must be supported with a trellis or pole. pole beans grow an average of 5- to 6-feet tall, and can grow either shell or snap bean. pole beans generally thrive in cooler summer temperatures, as low as 50-degrees in the summer. in the us, they thrive in the northern states. you can use whatever support system (trellis, pole, fence, arbor, etc.) that you want for pole beans. , bush beans are a type of beans that grow in off a bush, and do not need a trellis or pole for support. generally, bush beans grow best in warm environments with summer temperatures reaching above 100-degrees. in the us, they thrive in the southern states. bush beans should be planted in large rows, requiring much more space than pole beans. a variety of bush beans called ‘half-runners’ is a bush/pole hybrid, and may require some support or placement near a fence for stabilization., beans are flexible plants, able to grow in both sun and shade. when possible, choose a garden plot in most or partial sunlight. because pole beans grow primarily upwards, you need only a small space for them. bush beans grow outwards, meaning that they require much more space; choose a plot 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) wide and as long as you desire (for the total number of beans you wish to plant). , beans should be planted after the last frost has passed, typically in the spring months of march and april. planting too early in the season will cause the seeds to freeze and die, while planting too late may not give them enough time to mature for a harvest in the fall. check with your local agricultural extension to find out the best planting time for your area. , beans are one of the few plants that should not be started as seedlings indoors or transplanted into your garden. this is because they have a delicate root structure that is easily damaged, and may not survive the transfer. as a result, you should sow your seeds directly into the ground come spring., beans grow best in soil with good drainage and lots of nutrients. to prepare your soil, mix in a garden compost and gardening topsoil into your garden", "the very first and basic step is you need to initiate talking about the matter. keep it light. you have to bring that comfort level so that they feel like they can open up to you. this comes through sharing and asking them about what is happening in their life. slowly you need to encourage them to include some activity. by regularly asking them about how and what they're doing, you can encourage them to find activities that keep themselves busy, which will keep them active as well as mentally or physically fit and more over they’ll start enjoying their life and leisure time.; , you might already have a head start here. your mum might have told you how she likes to try new recipes or she wishes she knew how to take better photographs, or your dad may enjoy hanging out with his friends or playing chess. help them find what they want to do. ask them about where their interests lie and if necessary, make suggestions. encourage your mom to join a book group or a cooking class. ask if your dad wants to join a club or start writing articles or a novel. by encouraging them in whatever endeavors interest them, you can help release them from the idea that their whole life revolves around you. , parents are sometimes scared of finding time for themselves or doing anything for themselves because they think it might distract them from being parents. you need to assure them that now you are grown enough to look after yourself, it’s time for them to focus on themselves. you need to convince them that you are grown up! this won’t happen by simply saying to them, “ma/papa, i am grown up now. i can look after myself.” no! truly convincing them requires you to handle your responsibilities and demonstrate your independence through your actions. not only can you show responsibility for yourself, but you can also show them that you're ready and eager to help them out, too. taking your parents to their appointments, helping them around the house, or doing other favors and errands for them can help. taking care of their needs and most importantly finding time for them is key, too; call them regularly to ask how their day was or what are they planning to do this weekend will make a big difference. bottom line is you have to make them realize you can take care of yourself, so now they should spend their time on themselves. , if they like doing something, get involved in it with them. if your dad likes playing pool, go and play with him. if your mum likes playing games on her phone, sit along with her and watch her play. if she likes cooking, ask her to teach you a new recipe, or suggest a new recipe to her. by showing your enthusiasm for what they're doing, you can subtly push them to stay engaged with those activities. and the fact that you are taking interest in what they are doing", "when you are feeling lonely, it might feel like you are isolated. feeling down can cause you to want to withdraw. that's normal. but you will feel better if you attempt some human contact.pick up the phone. reach out to a friend and ask if they have a few minutes to talk. you can try keeping the tone light, but making your feelings clear. say, \"i'm feeling a little lonely and i could use a laugh. what's the funniest thing that happened to you today?\" the phone is a great way to keep in touch. maybe you have moved away from some of your friends and are looking for a way to connect. don't be afraid to dial their numbers regularly.; , traveling is a great way to beat the loneliness blues. figure out somewhere to go and start planning. organizing a trip will give you something fun to focus on and look forward to.go visit a friend. have you been longing for a girls weekend with your best friends? find a great spot to meet and start planning. you can also plan a solo trip. choose a place to visit that you've always wanted to see. you could also mix some alone time with some socializing. have you been missing your brother lately? take a road trip. you can take a few days to yourself on your way to visit him. , start putting some dates on the calendar. reach out to some friends and set up some outings. when you're feeling lonely, it can be really helpful to have something fun to look forward to.plan a variety of activities. for example, e-mail a friend you haven't seen in a while and ask if she's free for a coffee date. you could also schedule some evening activities. ask your neighbor if he wants to try out the new pizza place around the corner. consider having a party. you don't need a special occasion to reach out to your friends and ask them to come over for a wine and cheese party. , when you are feeling especially lonely, it might not be enough to just have a casual get together with a friend. sometimes you might feel like you need some more in-depth bonding. try reaching out to someone you really care for and asking for some quality time.contact a family member. try saying, \"i've been feeling a little down lately. it would be great to spend some time with you. do you mind if i come spend the weekend with you?\" be honest about how you're feeling. remember, it's normal to feel lonely. let your friends and family help. do something you enjoy. ask a close friend to go on a long hike with you. the fresh air and companionship might make you feel better. , you don't have to reach out to someone you know. you can actually feel less alone by connecting with a perfect stranger. try doing something nice for someone.give up your seat on a crowded bus. smile and say, \"here, you take this seat.\" you'll", "the opposing keeper will give you a good idea about where to aim your kick. when a direct free kick is called, some of the opposing players will form a wall ten yards away from you in front of the keeper. while the purpose of the wall is to help the keeper defend against the kick, it can also obscure his view of the striker. usually, the keeper will try to stay in the middle of the goal. if he does this, aim your kick toward either the left or right goal post. if the keeper remains closer to one side of the goal, aim your shot to the opposite side or try to kick it over the wall. try to put the ball in a difficult spot for the keeper to react to. you might even be able to trick the keeper by looking in the opposite direction and kicking where he started off. if the infraction occurs in the opposing penalty box, you’ll kick a penalty kick. this is a type of direct free kick in which only the striker and the goalie participate.; , you should always know how hard and which direction the wind is blowing before you take your kick. severe wind can drastically alter the trajectory of the ball. take a peek at the corner flags on either side of the pitch before you set up your shot. take the wind into consideration and adjust your aim so that the ball still goes where you want it to. remember that a strong gust of wind can also cause your ball to sail over the goal post so you might have to aim the ball lower than you normally would. a weak kick will be affected by the wind more than a powerful kick. , complete the motion of your kick by bringing your leg all the way through. following through with your shot will guide it in the right direction. think of your leg like a pendulum swinging straight through the ball. if you don’t follow through with your shot, it may end up in a different spot than you intend it to. keep your follow through controlled. if you try to follow through too much, you could hyper-extend your leg or slip and fall on your back. your kick should always be controlled so you don't get hurt. hold your follow through for a few seconds after kicking the ball. , the length of your run-up will depend on how much power you need to generate for your shot. if the direct kick is placed far away from the opposing goal, you’ll need more power. measure out four or five steps. your run-up for a long shot should cover about ten yards. if the direct kick is placed closer to the opposing goal, accuracy will be more important than power. for a short shot, you may only need to take a one step run-up. practice your run-up before game time to get it perfect. if you stutter-step to the ball, you’ll lose power and accuracy.", "you should always avoid self-pity. when you are preparing for pcat, you should have that self-confidence of achieving what you want to do in life. learn your strengths and qualities as you prepare for the test. suppose you are studying pcat chemistry and you come across certain problems, you should not feel bad about it. instead, make sure that you ask an expert and get your doubts cleared. at the end of the day, you should aim to understand all that you study, so that you do not face any problems while answering a question.; , life will try to put several obstacles on your way, but you have to be strong enough to handle all that you face. if you are able to change the way you think, you can change a lot of things that come in your way. you should have a positive attitude to change all your negative thoughts into positive ones. get rid of all your negative thoughts and deal with the entire situation accordingly. think rationally and then find out a solution to your problems. inculcate some realistic thoughts and ways

practice papers as you can. the more you practice; you will be able to get acquainted with the test taking techniques and strategies of the examination. moreover, these practice papers will give you an insight of the pattern of questions that you are going to face in the examination. on the other hand, solving the test papers will give you control over time. try to solve practice test papers within the given time limit and, if possible, sit with a stopwatch. with regular practice, you will become confident enough to face the atrocities of time and overcome the challenges that such an examination throws on your way. , revision is necessary to know your chapters by heart. in simple words, if you do not revise, you will not be able to remember all that you have studied. whenever you read something, after sometime, close your eyes and then try to reminisce what you have studied. review and revision is essential to retain all that you have studied in your memory. once you know that you are well prepared, then you will surely be confident about your capabilities and can get rid of exam pressure as well. , do not think about your previous failures. remembering previous defeat will surely knock you down. crush all your fears within and rise up. tell yourself that though you cannot control the situations in your life, but you can surely control your decisions and your life. remind yourself about all the good deeds that you have done in life. if you", "although you won’t begin actively researching or writing a dissertation until you reach the final part of your doctoral program – usually after several years of graduate-level coursework and exams – you should start thinking about potential projects well in advance. your first few years of graduate school are crucial because they will introduce you to the important scholarship in your field. as you work to master this material, you might as well consider what you might be able to add to it. keep a running list of your ideas. ask yourself: what areas of your field need further exploration? is some of the existing scholarship lacking in nuance? could you apply an existing scholarly model to new situations or difference evidence? what existing scholarly arguments might be effectively challenged, given appropriate evidence? are there important scholarly debates in your field that you might be able to address, using a different focus?; , even within the same field, different departments approach the dissertation project in a variety of ways. you need to know what a satisfactory dissertation looks like in your field, from your university, written with the support of your department – and ideally, your particular advisor and committee members. doing some basic research will help you feel more confident and make the process seem a little less shrouded in mystery. you will be more likely to choose a project that will enable you to fulfill your department’s expectations. ask questions. your advisor or director of graduate studies should be able to give you some information about departmental standards for the dissertation and answer any general questions you have. examine completed dissertations from your department. many universities put doctoral dissertations online or shelve them at the library. look at a few recent ones. how long are they, on average? what kind of research do they contain? how are they typically organized? , be open-minded and receptive to their suggestions. remember that people who have been through the dissertation process already may be in a better position than you are to recognize the potential problems with some of your ideas. if they advise you that a particular idea is overly ambitious or that you will be unlikely to find evidence to answer a certain research question, listen to them and take their input seriously. , you want to choose a project that can be completed in a reasonable amount of time, given the resources you are likely to have.unfortunately, this sometimes means that you’ll have to set aside some of your most exciting and ambitious ideas. remember: if you cannot complete your dissertation within the time constraints, then it won’t matter how brilliant or revolutionary your ideas were. consider department and university timelines. most programs limit the number of years you can spend on your dissertation. know your time constraints, and factor them into the process of choosing a project. in many fields, you will have to factor in your funding possibilities. how much travel, archival research, and/or laboratory work will your project require? how will you fund that work? how much", "they give it to you for a reason. don't only write homework, but make sure to write down other stuff you'll need to remember (like games, practices, study sessions, etc). in order to be a successful high school student, you need to have the ability to stay on top of all your activities. use your agenda to stay organized and follow through with your plans. also, use your agenda to set time limits. if you're spending more than an hour on that math assignment, you're clearly not getting it, and are only hurting yourself. stop, put it aside, move on to other homework. come back to it later and if you still don't get it, explain what happened to your teacher. chances are, they'll be happy to help and not dock your grade. just make sure you've made an attempt to do the work.; , make sure you have all the supplies you need. it may help to have one 3-ring binder with pockets for each class (maybe only a folder for an elective class) with loose-leaf paper and dividers if they help. if your teacher likes to lecture, have a spiral or composition notebook for notes and jot down pictures and thoughts to help you remember- the pages are less likely to rip out than loose-leaf. keep papers in chronological order- they'll be easier to find later when studying. if your binder starts to get full, transfer old papers into another binder to keep at home. this way you won't have to lug them around, but they will be there when studying for midterms and finals. , you don't have to be the nerd who holes himself/herself up in his/her bedroom friday night or reads gigantic books in the corner of the room to be considered someone who takes school seriously. the truth is, school is important. you need it to have a good resume, and you need it to get into a good college and later get a good career that will support you for the rest of your life, but even though you decide not to go to college, school does help a lot. social wise and intellectually. it's important to have fun and have lots of extra-curricular activities, but school should always be your number one priority. that being said, never take homework, tests, and quizzes lightly! note that extra-curricular activities are also good with college resumes as well. , balance is the key. you can be someone who makes straight a's in all advanced classes, but if you have zero extra-curricular activities in your application for college, you will have a much more difficult time getting accepted. it's just not attractive either way. keep on top of your schoolwork but make sure you let your hair down a little sometimes to join a few clubs consistently throughout your high school years. you won't regret it. , you don't have to wear spirit colors everyday or be a cheerleader to do this. all you need to do is to stay on top of things- current events, who won", "before you begin training, you need some items if you want to train as fast as possible in as little time as you can. first, you want to get 10 vitamins for all stats (or just the stats you need, if you've already picked your spread). you can get these in laverre city's pokémon center. they're a bit pricey, but use some bargain o-powers and you should be able to afford them. next, you need the power items. you can get these in the battle maison in kiloude city for bp. you need 16 bp for each though, so prepare to do a lot of battling to get these. optionally, you can only battle enough to get the items you need for a specific pokémon. these items are not required, but are greatly recommended as they will increase the number of evs given per pokémon. these are: power bracer (for attack) power anklet (for speed) power weight (for hp) power lens (for special attack) power belt (for defense) power band (for special defense); , after getting the items you need, you'll want a level 50-100 pokémon that has a move that can attack multiple pokémon like earthquake. you'll also need a pokémon with the disease pokerus, which can be received over wonder trade or in the wild. it's not absolutely necessary, but like the power items, they make the process go much faster. once you've acquired these, put the carrier of pokerus in front of your party and turn off the exp. share in your key items. battle a few pokémon until the pokémon you want to train has the disease, and you can put the carrier away in the pc and turn the exp. share back on. last but not least, you should get a pokémon that knows sweet scent so you can force horde encounters. , a good tool for ev spreads for gens i through v is smogon, but if you're training a pokémon new to x/y, you'll have to either look up ev spreads online or use pokémon showdown, an online battling simulator. just go to teambuilder, click new team, choose the ou format and click add pokémon. type in your pokémon and its ability and nature. you can fill in the moves depending on what role you'd like it to play on your team. after you do this, click the box under stats and there should be a long button on top, which recommends a spread based on the moves you chose. this isn't perfect, but it's definitely a good start if you're not sure. if you know what ev spread you'd like, we can move on to deciding which pokémon to fight against. , each pokémon gives a pre-determined numbers of evs in a stat. to find the one you want to train against, go to nugget bridge's article on ev training hotspots and scroll down to hordes. depending on what stats you're training in, it will give which pokémon are the best for which stat and where to find them. after choosing, head off to", "if you experience frequent urination, or worry about certain situations in which urgent urination may be an issue, you may want to invest in a hospital bottle. these devices are built with an angled opening to make it easier to urinate in without spilling. they are also very large and can usually accommodate multiple urinations.hospital bottles are available online or through licensed medical providers. they can usually be purchased for a relatively low cost.; , in choosing a bottle, it's important to select a bottle that is an appropriate size. while it's impossible to accurately predict precisely how much urine you will excrete, you can ensure that your bottle is large enough to contain an average person's urine volume. every person's body is different, but urine volumes generally range between 120 ml and 465 ml, or approximately four to 16 fluid ounces.choose a bottle that can hold at least 465 ml, or approximately 16 ounces.if the bottle is bigger than that, it shouldn't be a problem. remember: it's better for a bottle to be too big than too small. the average soda bottle size is 12 fluid ounces, or approximately 355 ml. larger soda bottles come in 1.75 liter sizes (1750 ml, or approximately 59 fluid ounces), but remember that a soda bottle of any size will have a very narrow opening.sports drink bottles like gatorade and powerade tend to have a wider mouth. for example, gatorade offers a 20 fluid ounce (approximately 591 ml) bottle designed to have a wide mouth opening. because of this, many people prefer using sports drinks bottles to urinate into., whether you're alone in a car or tent, or have others with you, it's important to mark your designated pee bottle to avoid any potential confusion.you can keep it simple by drawing a big \"x\" on the bottle in permanent marker, or be more explicit in your message (like \"do not drink,\" for example). , female urination devices, or fuds, are essentially small funnels built for women to urinate standing up or into a bottle. there are many brands of fuds, including gogirl and freshette, which can be used by women who need to urinate but can't find a toilet.to use an fud, simply hold the funnel under your vagina, relatively close to your body. urinate into the device, and angle the narrow end into the mouth of a bottle.you can find an fud online or at many retail stores, including outdoor gear stores. , in addition to the actual bottle, you'll need to bring adequate cleanup supplies. if you're a woman, this will mean bringing toilet paper or tissues to wipe up with. you'll also need soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, regardless of gender., if at all possible, retreat to a secluded location. if you are in a car, being seen by others shouldn't be a problem. if you're at a crowded event, like a sports match or a parade, and cannot get to a restroom, urinating in a bottle will be a little more difficult. you want to avoid being seen,", "you don’t have to think of realistic or precise goals just yet. begin by writing down any goal that comes to mind. for example, write down “make captain of the football team.” even if you aren’t sure it’s a realistic goal, it’s okay to write it down at this point. you can narrow down your goals later.write your goals on a poster and stick it above the desk that you look at each day.; , you may be excited and making all kinds of goals, but it’s better to pace yourself once you’ve written your initial goals down. choose specific, realistic goals or even one single but very important goal. when it comes to choosing your goal, ensure that it states precisely what it is that you want to achieve. write these down in a journal and keep it with you at home and school.for example, instead of saying you want to study more, say that you want to study for three hours every night during the school week. , now that you’ve written down specific goals, separate them into either immediate or long-term goals. an immediate goal would be to organize all of your notes and schoolwork. a long-term goal would be to make honor roll at then end of the year. keep the immediate and long-term goals on separate pages., there are certain things you won’t be able to set deadlines for, like final tests and tryouts for teams. but, you do need to make deadlines for goals that don’t have set dates. for example, if you want to learn a certain amount of vocabulary words for the sat, set a number for a specific date. write down that date in your notebook and keep it in mind as the year progresses.it’s also helpful to write down the dates of things that are out of your control, like final tests. , seeing all of your goals written down can be overwhelming. a positive attitude is essential when it comes to achieving your goals. you can maintain a positive attitude by thinking of the positive things that happen in your day, considering your strengths, and remembering that everyone has a bad day sometimes.write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal in a positive way. for example, instead of writing “stop failing vocabulary quizzes,” you can write “improve grades on vocabulary quizzes.” be open with a friend or family member about your feelings and worries. , getting organized will make it easier to stay on top of achieving your goals. organize your backpack, locker, notebooks, and anything else that holds your schoolwork or other paperwork. determine what you need and get rid of the junk. keep your things organized throughout the school year.spend 10 minutes on organization when you get home from school every day. , it’s easy to get distracted and do something that sounds like more fun than work. a little bit of procrastination is normal, so don’t get mad at yourself if it happens. instead, work on overcoming procrastination. do things like prioritizing your tasks, starting with the", "jicama doesn’t do well during a frost, so wait to plant until the weather has warmed up to plant it in your garden. research the average date of the last frost in your area, and plant your jicama one to two weeks after this date.the jicama plant may not grow properly if you live in an environment that stays mostly cold.; , unless you already have seeds, you will need to obtain them. jicama seeds can be purchased at a nursery, some home improvement stores, or even online. check the packet to make sure you have the right seeds before planting., put the jicama seeds in lukewarm water to speed up germination. place seeds in a shallow pan of warm water. allow them to sit for 24 hours. then, remove the seeds from the water., look for a place in your garden that receives at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day. the spot you choose to grow the jicama will have an effect on the outcome of the harvest. the location you choose should be exposed to full sun for the duration of the six to eight hours., choose a location with moist but well-drained soil. make sure the soil is alkaline with a ph over 7. you can test this easily with a commercial ph tester.if you want to grow the seeds before the last frost, then you can plant them in a pot indoors. you should use planting soil, perlite, or vermiculite, and a little peat moss in a medium-sized pot. the pot should be placed under a grow light or by a sunny windowsill. if you start with the seeds in a pot, wait for them to grow to 3 in (7.6 cm) tall before you plant them in the garden. , if you decide to plant the seeds in a pot before the frost, you will need to take care of the seeds. once you have planted them in a medium-sized pot with planting soil, water the seeds regularly until the last frost. water the seeds until the soil is moist any time the soil feels dry. , make the holes about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) in depth. the amount of holes you dig depends on the amount of seeds you have to plant. the holes should be about 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart. if you plant more than one row, then the rows should be 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) apart., you can dig the holes first, or dig them as you plant the seeds. the soil should feel moist and warm without you watering it first. cover the seeds and tamp them down lightly. , sprinkle water over the soil after you plant and then when it becomes dry. do not saturate the seeds with water, even if the soil is dry. the soil should only feel moist once you sprinkle the water.using a watering can will help regulate how much water you pour onto the soil. , you can use an all-purpose fertilizer. the exact instructions for fertilizing depends", "an eggplant, whether you choose the large variety or the smaller baby eggplants, should feel firm, even when ripe. find one with smooth skin that is dark purple or black without too many bruises or blemishes.; , rinse the eggplant thoroughly in cool water, making sure to scrub away any dirt from the surface of the skin. you may want to use a vegetable scrub brush, especially if your eggplant is from a farmer's market and still has bits of soil on it. , place the eggplant on its side on a cutting board. use a sharp knife to cut off the tip of the eggplant from the smaller end, taking care to remove the green cap and stem. next, slice the eggplant according to your taste. choose from the following common ways of slicing eggplant to prepare it for baking: slice it in half lengthwise. this is the simplest, most straightforward method, and is a great option if you're working with small eggplants. each half of the eggplant will account for one serving. place the eggplant on the cutting board and carefully slice it from tip to tip. slice it into discs. this is another popular method for preparing baked eggplant. discs of eggplant may be baked by itself or used as the foundation for more complicated dishes, like stuffed eggplant. place the eggplant on its side on the cutting board and use a knife to slice it into discs of equal width. slice it into cubes. since eggplant breaks down when it bakes, slicing it into cubes results in a softer, creamier baked dish overall. to prepare it this way, slice the eggplant into discs, then slice each disc into quarters. , place the cut eggplant on a baking sheet lined with paper towels and use a liberal amount of salt on the open side of the eggplant slices. salting helps draw out the extra water, so the baked eggplant will turn out less watery and mushy. it also prevents the eggplant from soaking up too much oil. you can skip this step if you're in a hurry, but it's worth doing if you want the texture of your eggplant to turn out perfectly., as the salt sits on the eggplant slices, you will see droplets of water begin to bead and drip from the fruit. if you don't see this occurring, sprinkle more salt on the eggplant. , carefully squeeze the water into a bowl or the sink, then pat the eggplant slices with paper towels to absorb the excess moisture. be careful not to squeeze too hard and crush the eggplant. ,, lay the eggplant cut-side up on a baking sheet. drizzle the eggplant with olive oil or another type of vegetable oil. use a pastry brush or the back of a spoon to smooth the oil over the eggplant until the flesh is lightly coated all over. sprinkle the slices with salt and pepper. , place the eggplant in the oven and bake it until the inside is creamy and the edges and surface have turned brown", "one of the best ways to avoid getting f’s on tests is to attend class and complete your work on time. tests are usually based off of material discussed in class or from previous assignments, and if you don’t keep up, it will be hard to do well. before the test, teachers often discuss the format of the exam or give advice on how to study, and if you’re not present you could miss crucial information. if you have to miss class or can’t turn in an assignment, ask a classmate or friend to borrow notes. also, try to complete the assignment even if you can’t receive credit so you’re better prepared for the test.; , writing out information will help you remember it, so taking good notes in class or when you’re studying will help ensure you get a great grade on the test.having clearly written and well-organized notes will also make studying a lot easier. if you already have notes from class, try recopying them before the exam. this will be a more effective study strategy than simply re-reading them. , organizing your study materials will make it a lot easier to prepare for the test. it also helps you feel more in control, confident, and ready to tackle the exam. use a binder or folder to keep track of and group your notes. a planner or calendar can help you remember test dates and due dates, and you can also schedule regular study sessions. , familiarizing yourself with the format of the test will help you be as prepared as possible when you sit down to take it. take the time to do research and ask your teacher questions about the test format. if this is a standardized exam that many people all over your state or country take, look up some information online about the test. pay attention to the type of questions they ask, the time limits, and look for any specific test-taking tips or resources that might be available. if it's an exam for a specific class, ask the teacher if they can tell you about the format of the exam. they might be willing to give you some details , taking tests is stressful, especially when you feel a lot of pressure to do well, but negative thoughts can limit your ability to successfully study for the test. try to push these negative thoughts aside, and replace them with more positive ones.instead of focusing on how you are going to fail the exam or fail the class if you don’t do well on the test, remind yourself that you’ve been working hard and preparing. tell yourself that you’re going to do well. try visualizing yourself easily answering the questions on the test. , although it can be tempting to wait until the last minute to cram for an exam, it won’t help you learn the material or ace the test. the earlier you begin studying, the more prepared you’ll be for the exam.studying right before the test often makes you feel more panicked and it", "make eye contact with the customers after they are seated and promptly introduce yourself. this starts the conversation out on the right foot, leading to better tips on average, and gives them a polite way to get your attention later.multitask by introducing yourself as you pass out the menus and check that every customer has enough silverware and napkins. , when speaking to customers, always use respectful terms of address such as sir, ma'am, and miss. act friendly and positive, and make your customers feel as comfortable as possible. ask the customer whether they have dined at your restaurant before -- that way if they are new, first-time customers you can welcome them and offer your help with the menu. appear friendly, but do not get involved in the customer's conversation unless asked. do your job, then leave the customer to eat or talk in relative privacy. always remember to smile. no matter how irritating customers or co-workers can be, just put on a pleasant face and suck it up -- this will save you a lot of drama! don't talk or gossip about customers even when you think they can't hear you. remain polite and respectful when discussing them in case they are in earshot. , never sit down at the table to take an order. don't shake hands or hug unless you are personal friends with the customer, or you are shaking hands to greet them as per restaurant policy. other physical interactions depend on the atmosphere of the place you work, and whether you are a man or woman. studies of u.s. restaurants show that women who touch a customer lightly on the shoulder, hand, or arm receive better tips from that customer on average.this should only be done when the customer appears relaxed and comfortable, and never if the customer is on a date with a woman. be friendly rather than flirtatious. , if a customer asks for advice, be prepared to answer whatever questions they have or recommend your favorite dish in each category. if a customer orders a dish that gets a lot of complaints, try to recommend another option. customers like it when you give them the \"inside scoop\", but you shouldn't go so far as to insult a dish unless you work in an unusually relaxed environment. instead, steer them away from a bad dish by recommending a similar, better option as \"the chef's specialty\" or \"my personal favorite\". , many people have serious reasons to avoid certain ingredients, including potentially fatal allergies. if you aren't familiar with every dish on the menu (which you should be), do your best to find out for them how it is prepared. never lie to a customer and give them an ingredient they requested to have removed. if you can't accommodate the request, simply say so and suggest a similar alternative that the customer can eat. don't question your customers. keep in mind there are many reasons for menu change requests, such as religious, vegetarian/vegan and cultural dietary restrictions. if the request can be accommodated, don't ask", "go to http://www.airbnb.com and start by typing in where you’d like to go, the

to do to entertain them.; , the toy should be one of the toys the baby already has. if it's a toy that you brought, make sure that you washed it thoroughly ahead of time and that it is not too small to play with. if the baby starts sucking on the toy don't be grossed out or alarmed, as this is a way for the baby to further explore the toy will their sense of taste. here are a few good toys to bring for the baby if you are bringing toys: rattles small stuffed animals/stuffed dolls/stuffed puppets (as long as the toys is not too small and that the toy isn't a dollar store one as if the baby is teething, he/she may break pieces off of the toys and swallow it) water toys like funnels and rubber ducks (it's best not to let baby suck on these toys, and while near the water when playing will the toys, keep a firm grip on the baby and do not let the baby fall in or put the baby in intentionally) , try bringing a picture book or a kid-friendly magazine like national geographic kids or chirp so that you can show the baby the pictures in the magazine/book. you can also simply change baby's surroundings a bit. do this by taking a bit of a walk inside or outside the house, letting them look out the window, or turning on the t.v, changing it to a kid-friendly channel like treehouse, or tvo kids. you can also let them study your face if they haven't seen you before or if they haven't seen you often. if they are familiar with you, try making funny faces (like 'fish' faces, sticking your tongue out and so on) at them and see if you get a reaction. , for touch, tickle them, rub different textured things (like felt, faux fur, a soft fabric and so on) against their skin, blow gently on their skin, and walk your fingers up their arms and legs. for sight, show them pictures from kid-friendly magazines and picture books, change their surroundings, and make funny faces (see previous step for more). for hearing, make different sounds/noises (ring a bell, tap your fingernail against something, and so on), whistle and make clucking noises with your tongue, and simply talk to them using different tones and pitches. for taste, let them suck on their thumbs and toys (see step 2 for a little more on this), and possibly give them a new flavour of baby food or something like that. for smell, bring a few mildly smelly things with you (flowers are ideal) and let them smell them (don't let them suck on it though!). , this can be quite entertaining for both the baby, and you! also, if they say something that sounds like it could be developed into a word (for example, if they

helpful when you want to think about intangible skills like fortitude, kindness, creativity, or adaptability. try the university of kent strengths test.you could also take a myers-briggs type test.; , whether you tend to be shy our outgoing, you probably have a number of valuable skills. consider how you interact with others. think about what intangible strengths (such as an outgoing nature or the ability to delegate) are apparent in your interaction style. do you enjoy working with other people on a group project, or would you rather work alone? in a group setting, do you tend to take the lead, or would you rather contribute by being a good foot soldier? do you feel very sympathetic toward other people’s problems? perhaps you are naturally caring and empathetic.do you tend to notice things that others don’t? it sounds like you have great observation skills. do you tend to be very at ease in social situations? you’re probably pretty outgoing. , some people tend to base their decisions on logic, whereas others care more about personal feelings. both logic and emphasis on values are important strengths.for example, when you decide to buy a new sofa, if you spend hours reading consumer reports and comparison shopping, you probably value logic. on the other hand, if you sit on a sofa, think that it’s super comfy, and then decide to buy it, you base decisions more on personal feelings. , some people like to know what they’re doing well in advance. they like schedules and do a good job following them. other people like to “go with the flow.” they prefer a flexible agenda. both planning and flexibility are valuable skills.one way to think about this is to think about how you like to vacation. do you spend hours on the internet before you leave on a trip, planning every stop? or do you wait and see where the wind blows you? , flow is a state of mind in which you lose your sense of time because you’re paying so much attention to a task. when you’re in flow, you often feel very energized and engaged and good at what you’re doing. then think about what kind of intangible skills go into this particular activity. for example, do you lose yourself in art projects? do you find yourself brimming with new ideas whenever you’re asked to design a project? if so, creativity may be one of your intangible strengths., perhaps you are naturally athletic and were born with great eye coordination, and you don't have to practice much in order to sink free throws. on the other hand, maybe you make all of your free throws because you practice ten hours a

you also need to know the breakdown of the payment and how much goes to principal-interest-taxes-insurance (piti). if you have less than 20 percent equity in the home, you may also be paying private mortgage insurance (pmi) of .25 to 2 percent per year. contact your homeowner's insurance carrier. you may be receiving discounts because you bundle multiple vehicles with your home or paying a penalty because one spouse has a history of claims. since your insurance is part of your mortgage piti, a change in the insurance can change the payment.; , the spouse who wants to keep the house needs to be realistic. a true equity buy-out, paying your spouse a lump sum for his share of the equity and removing his name from the mortgage and the deed, means you will have to qualify for a mortgage on your own. mortgage lenders typically use 28 percent of the borrower's gross income as a benchmark. you can obtain a free copy of your personal credit report from the three primary credit reporting companies thanks to the fair credit reporting act (fcra). the credit report through the fcra will not include your credit score. the report is more critical, you can check it for inaccurate information and any issues you might be able to resolve before you attempt to refinance. there are several online tools for estimating your credit score. look for one that does not require you to provide credit card information or sign up for a subscription to questionable credit monitoring services. , whether the housing market is volatile or sluggish, you need to know the current market value of the house, regardless of the mortgage. tidy up the house and property. a solid appraisal will help with the refinancing. , your appraiser will look at the neighborhood comparative market analysis, cma or \"comps,\" but it doesn't hurt to look into them on your own. you can check out what houses similar to yours are on the market for, but the key is not asking price, it is selling price. a real estate agent can run a report for you, or there are online tools for estimating the comps in your area., equity buy-outs offers risks and rewards for both spouses. for the one who keeps the house, a buy-out means assuming the entire mortgage, but reaping the rewards if the house increases in value. for the spouse giving up his share, it means getting out from under the risk and burden of the mortgage and getting a fixed share without having to worry about the future of the housing market in that neighborhood. the equity is calculated as the appraised value of the house minus the balance on the mortgage. if you've owned the house for less than five years, unless you made a substantial down payment or living in a hot housing market, you may be surprised at how little equity you have. for example,", "keep a copy of the current insurance summary in the car in a safe place so it is easy to find but won't get tossed out when you clean up, vacuum, and de-trash your car. keep in mind that if you crash into the nice car that belongs to someone else it could cost over $50,000 to fix or replace the car. make sure you have enough coverage.; ,,, some people keep these in another location but this is a problem when you are at the shop, or home for the weekend. you may wish you had them in the car if someone asks when you last rotated the tires, changed the oil or transmission fluid, or flushed the radiator. keep these receipts in the car. , under inflated tires cause many accidents. an under inflated tire can be torn off the rim when cornering hard causing a serious crash. , check the owners manual for guidance. it is recommended to change the oil every 3,000 miles (4,800 km). , dirty oil and dirty air filters will allow dirt into the engine and scar the inside of the engine making wear out much faster and cause early and very expensive engine failure. , this means having the wheels taken off and put back on in different locations such as moving the front tires to the back and vice versa. this helps the tires wear more evenly and last sometimes twice as long. , seasonal temperature swings can change the pressure in tires even if there is no leak. , brake shoes eventually wear out just like the soles of your walking shoes. when they wear all the way through it can cause damage to the brake rotor that can be expensive to fix. even though they stop the car effectively the shoes could be very thin and start damaging the brakes any time so check them visually when rotating your tires. , these are easy to check on most cars by opening the engine compartment: oil coolant/anti-freeze transmission fluid brake fluid windshield wiper fluid. if they are low they should be topped off. if they keep getting low you might have a leak. check your parking spot for drips. , learn how to use the jack and lug wrench that is in your car and practice jacking up your car and changing a tire in your driveway so you will know what to do if you get a

perform calculations without having to input any formulas or copy any cells. you will need a spreadsheet with several entries in order to create a pivot table. you can also create a pivot table in excel using an outside data source, such as access. you can insert the pivot table in a new excel spreadsheet.; , a pivot table is not always the answer you are looking for. in order to take advantage of the pivot table features, your spreadsheet should meet some basic criteria:your spreadsheet should include at least one column with duplicate values. this basically just means that at least one column should have repeating data. in the example discussed in the next section, the \"product type\" column has two entries: \"table\" or \"chair\". it should include numerical information. this is what will be compared and totaled in the table. in the example in the next section, the \"sales\" column has numerical data. , click the \"insert\" tab at the top of the excel window. click the \"pivottable\" button on the left side of the insert ribbon. if you are using excel 2003 or earlier, click the data menu and select pivottable and pivotchart report... , by default, excel will select all of the data on your active spreadsheet. you can click and drag to choose a specific part of the spreadsheet, or you can type the cell range in manually. if you are using an external source for your data, click the \"use an external data source\" option and click choose connection.... browse for the database connection saved on your computer. , after selecting your range, choose your location option from the same window. by default, excel will place the table on a new worksheet, allowing you to switch back and forth by clicking the tabs at the bottom of the window. you can also choose to place the pivot table on the same sheet as the data, which allows you to pick the cell you want it to be placed.when you are satisfied with your choices, click ok. your pivot table will be placed and the interface will change. , when creating a pivot table, you are essentially sorting your data by rows and columns. what you add where determines the structure of the table. drag a field from the field list on the right onto the row fields section of the pivot table to insert the information. for example, your company sells two products: tables and chairs. you have a spreadsheet with the number (sales) of each product (product type) sold in your five stores (store). you want to see how much of each product is sold in each store. drag the store field from the field list into the row fields section of the pivot table. your list of stores will appear, each as its own row. , like the rows, the columns allow you to sort and display your data. in the above example, the store field was", "as you begin learning the chokehold, have a qualified instructor supervise and teach you the movements. judo instructors, specifically, have extensive experience and background on the chokehold and because holds are potentially fatal, they should be treated seriously. when executed correctly, a chokehold should render your opponent unconscious, but not cause any injury or significant pain.; , because choke-holds can be dangerous, it's important that as you practice them, you are able to recognize when your opponent begins to lose consciousness. when this happens, it is good to immediately release pressure so your opponent can regain consciousness. if your opponent begins tapping you or has obviously surrendered and submitted to defeat, let them go. especially in practice, you don't want to continue applying pressure to your opponent when they have decided to let you win. you will be able to tell your opponent is beginning to lose consciousness by a generally limp feeling in the body, sudden lack of resistance, changing color of your opponent's face, or eyes closing., when a choke is executed correctly, it can render your opponent unconscious in as little as 8 to 13 seconds. as you practice and train, a good rule is to only hold a choke for 5 seconds. , the chokehold is a safe way to subdue someone, but when applying to older people, very young children, or those who suffer from cardiac disorders or hypertension it can cause more fatal damage. use common sense here when practicing., as training begins, your opponent will not be able to remain standing if you perform a standing chokehold, so it's good to start practicing from the ground. this will prevent injury caused from falling to the ground and will also give you better control.stabilizing your position will also increase your ability to use your entire body. , this will give you the best leverage and will leave your opponent in a position that is more unstable and thus more difficult to escape. leading your opponent into a position in which it is hard for them to put up resistance will give you the best control and freedom of action so you will be able to achieve the best choke., with your dominant arm, reach around your opponent's corresponding shoulder and hook your arm around their neck. the bend of your arm should rest in the middle of their neck, and your fist should rest near your opponent's opposite shoulder. then, clasp both of your hands together or put your other arm on the back of your opponent's head. sometimes it's better to wrap your arm around your opponent's weaker side, because it will be harder for them to escape your hold. use your judgement to determine which side will allow you a better grip. practice getting an accurate hold with your hands the moment you begin the choke. if you continually release to adjust your position your opponent will have more opportunity to escape. , using your biceps and forearms, exert pressure on your opponent's neck around the carotid arteries, which are located on the right", "although you may want his attention, it's important to give him his space. if he feels that you respect him and his personal space, he may be more likely to interact with you. otherwise, he may view you as a needy person and stay away from you. for instance, if he doesn't respond to your text within five minutes, understand that he has his own life. if you notice that he replies to you with very few words, don't become upset or demand that he says more. instead, it may be helpful to ask questions in your texts so that he has something to respond to. rather than sending him yes-or-no questions, try to come up with ones that may require him to reply with more words (ex: \"what did you think of the soccer game?\"). if he still gives you a short reply, you could wait for a short time to indicate that you want him to say a bit more.; , although you should avoid being overly talkative, initiate conversations with him to show that you're interested in his life. come up with interesting subjects that engage the both of you. be sure that you give him a chance to express his opinion. don't hesitate to ask questions about himself, as most people enjoy talking about themselves. if you don't have time to talk to him, a simple greeting is enough to grab his attention. if you have trouble selecting conversation topics, think of events that are occurring around you. for instance, if you recently had a biology test, talk to him about it and ask whether he did well or not. however, try to branch out and talk about other subjects rather than only focusing on school. if you notice that he isn't talking much, consider the possibilities. are you dominating the conversation and not allowing him a chance to speak? is he not interested in the subject? or is he just naturally quiet? do your best to remedy the situation so that he enjoys talking to you. , although you shouldn't stay in the spotlight for too long, it's a good idea to share some facts about your life with him so that he can get to know you more. tell him things about you - such as your hobbies - that will stick in his mind and show that you're a unique girl. you may even discover common interests, which may open the way for more conversations. , although you shouldn't overdo it, treat him nicely. for instance, if he doesn't have a lunch, offer to give him some money or share your food with him. if he tells you about something bad that happened to him, sympathize with him and listen to what he has to say. show that you care about him and his well-being. be careful when treating him nicely. if he isn't a good person, he may take advantage of your kindness. if you notice that he is using you, immediately stop and don't allow him to manipulate you. although you may be", "hyperhidrosis is a relatively mysterious condition where the nerves responsible for triggering the sweat glands become overactive for reasons unknown — although the problem becomes worse with stress or nervousness. hyperhidrosis usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face bilaterally (on both sides of the body) and episodes occur at least weekly during waking hours.some people suffering with hyperhidrosis constantly sweat throughout the day. people with severe hyperhidrosis can run the risk of dehydration unless they replenish their lost fluids with plenty of water. approximately 3% of the population experience bouts of hyperhidrosis, particularly adults aged 25 to 65 years.; , most antiperspirants found in grocery stores and pharmacies contain aluminum-based compounds that can temporarily block the pores that release sweat.consequently, the sweat doesn't reach the surface of the skin and eventually gets reabsorbed by the body. as such, apply liberal amount of antiperspirants under your arms, as well as onto the palms of your hands and soles of your feet. it may feel a little strange, but likely better than the clamminess that's commonly associated with hyperhidrosis. over-the-counter antiperspirants are usually best for cases of minor hyperhidrosis only. if you're applying antiperspirant to your hands, you may want to use unscented varieties, especially if you anticipate greeting people and shaking hands with them. , choose clothing wisely if you have hyperhidrosis. you should always wear clothes that are breathable and made from natural fabrics, such as cotton, light wool and silk.when you exercise, consider wearing more advanced fabrics that are designed to wick moisture away from your skin. cotton socks are best for sweaty feet, although you still might have to change them multiple times per day. shoes made from natural materials (especially leather and suede) can help prevent excessive sweating by allowing your feet to breathe. rotate the shoes you wear because they may not completely dry overnight. if you must wear damp shoes, use a hair dryer to get them as dry as possible. using talcum powder in your shoes might help absorb moisture and prevent them from being constantly damp. chronic dampness increases the risk of mold growth. , the more you sweat, the more salts, toxins and sugars get deposited on your skin, which attracts bacteria. the compounds in sweat combined with the waste material from the proliferating bacteria greatly contribute to foul body odor. as such, people with hyperhidrosis need to bathe more often (at least daily if not twice daily) to help keep the number of bacteria in check and to keep from becoming too malodorous.regular soap is fine for combating bacteria, but buy brands that have natural moisturizers (aloe, almond extract) in them so your skin doesn't get too dry and flaky. after taking a shower or bath, make sure to dry yourself thoroughly, especially between your toes and under your arms. people who sweat profusely on a regular basis are more prone to bacterial skin infections, particularly from ingrown toenails and minor abrasions. excessive loss of electrolytes is another issue for people with moderate-to-severe hyperhidrosis because sweat contains salt. loss of electrolytes often", "there are certain factors that can make you

moment and to help you become more aware of your surroundings. when travelling, you're already more aware of things around you because they're new. yet, you can't possibly take in everything and the novelty itself can be a form of minor distress until you feel comfortable with it. meditation can help you bridge the shock of the new with the comfort of enjoying learning about many new things and meeting new people. meditation will also help you to be mindful of anything that you need to be paying more attention to during your travels.; , travelling on a bus, train, boat, or other form of transport can provide you with the opportunity to meditate as the journey meanders on. there are different approaches possible, including: shut your eyes and concentrate only on the rhythm of the engine, wheels, tracks, etc. of the transport method. use this rhythm to aid your meditation, focusing only on the particular rhythm and excluding all else. count the number of cars you come across which are of a particular/favorite brand. focus solely on seeing those cars that you have singled out for finding. or count trees, signs, road markers, farmhouses, etc. whatever you feel is the right object to follow. close your eyes and count. count each breath in and each breath out, from one to ten, then return to one again. if you lose your way or your mind drifts, start again from the beginning as you shouldn't become out of touch with your breath and each count. this is a good way to while away the time of a long journey. simply relax. if it's a boat or train, and you're able to move around, find a comfortable corner in the sun or somewhere with a pleasant ambiance and simply relax your whole body. let your thoughts disappear and , your accommodation will undoubtedly vary

while the person is upset is much more difficult, though not impossible. mirror the person while you do each step. breathe in through the nose slowly and evenly until the the lungs are at full capacity. when the lungs are completely full, the stomach pushes out, so calling each breath a “belly breath” provides a concrete image that helps in visualizing the proper technique. hold the breath for a slow count of five. breathe out through the mouth, releasing the air slowly and evenly. repeat five times: five \"belly breaths\" held for a count of five make one group (or set).; , do it once in the morning and once in the evening. practice until the person can do the breathing independently. , it will add to the calming influence of the breathing itself. , once learned, it can be called upon as a sensory image when the person does become upset or out of control. , many times it is water, either waves or a gurgling brook. focus on determining the particular color of light that is calming. it is normally some uniform, pastel color. , it should consist of short lines which describe the process of walking towards the calming sound (perhaps a brook or ocean) and going towards the calming light. describe how, as the person gets closer, the place becomes safer and safer, how the warm light of a certain color is welcoming, protecting, calming. , this will enhance their ability to

forest, lake, mountains. you can use the same world that you would find in adventure quest worlds. you can do the same with runescape or wow if you want, just pick any other game that has an interesting world in it. if your house isn't big enough for all of the world, you can make rooms to be two different places that change when you want them to. , you will need another sheet of paper for this. think of a name and write it at the top of the sheet of paper. then draw out a big portrait rectangular box on the left hand side of he sheet of paper this will be where you draw your character, or if you don't like drawing it will be where you write what you have on you eg sword, armor etc. there are four classes to choose from. mage, warrior, healer, and rouge. each have there own special abilities that you come up with later. eg a wizard has spells, a warrior has special heavy blows etc. you then must draw out a bar on the right side of the paper, make sure you do all of this in pencil. the bar will be how much exp you have. you gain more from battling monster and doing quests. when your bar becomes full you level up learning a new move. we will come on to how to fill in this later. also do a bar for your health and a bar for your mana under the exp bar. draw another box for your items and then your character sheet will be finished. , in your world you will fight monsters and do quests to see what level you can get to. you will decide on what your character does in this world. in the town you start in, there will be an imaginary person to set you on your quest. the best kind of quest involves fighting creatures, getting around obstacles you have set up and a bit of finding objects. it doesn't have to conform to any specific rule (other than the rules of your role playing game and/or the world in which you are playing) but start simple and think up your own quests. the first step is to go to the place where the task is to be done and decide on the monster you will fight. see the next step in learning how to fight. , first of all you will need some dice, e.g. use the 12 sided dice on your ipod touch role playing game dice application, but 6 sided dice will do fine, you will just have to use double the amount of dice. the weapon you start with depends on your class, a healer or a mage will have a basic staff, a warrior will have a basic sword, and a rogue will have a basic dagger, all of these weapons", "a hands-free leash is a leash that has a belt, instead of a loop, at the end. you wear the belt around your waist with your dog’s leash attached to the belt. in general the process for walking your dog is the same.there are two great benefits for using a hands-free leash. one is the obvious, you’re hands are free. this makes it easier to reward your dog for good behaviour, and swing your arms if you’re walking quickly or running. two is that the main point of resistance to your dog is the middle of your body, right near your centre of gravity. this makes you significantly more stable than holding the leash in your hands. , when you go to the pet store to buy a leash, you’ll notice they come in every material, length and colour you can imagine. the colour you choose is completely up to you! the length should be based on the type of activity you’ll be performing with your dog. and the material should be based on personal comfort and expense.if you’re taking your dog for a loose leash walk, a leash that has the ability to uncoil and recoil is very useful. instead of folding pieces of the leash in your hands, you can simply click a button and allow your dog to uncoil the rope. these leashes, however, are not designed for heel walks, or walks where there are a lot of obstacles for a rope to get caught on (including people and other dogs). leashes can be made of metal chains, leather or nylon. here are some things you may want to consider when choose the material of a leash: metal - looks cool, but is heavy. can prevent a dog from attempting to bite the leash. leather - expensive, but easy to hold and use. the leather may not be as flexible in cold weather. nylon - the least expensive, and has the most variety. stands up after constant exposure to different weather conditions. but can be hard on the hands. , many dog owners enjoy bringing their dogs when going for a run, a bike ride, or rollerblading. this offers great exercise to both you and your dog, and should hopefully tire your dog out faster!remember to control your dog throughout the run. since it is a run, don’t allow your dog to stop unless you do. you both should be able to maintain the same, steady pace. , your dog should have more slack on the leash while walking, than while standing still. they should always feel comfortable in their leash and collar to avoid injury and misbehaviour. when walking, your dog should be immediately to your side (which side will depend on what’s more comfortable to you). your dog should not walk behind or in front of you.if you allow your dog to walk behind you on a leash, there’s a great chance you’ll pull too hard on the leash in order to force the dog to keep up with you. , your right hand should be holding", "you’ll need to get a special fine-toothed comb to detect lice. you can buy the comb from your local pharmacy, medical supply store, grocery store or large retailer.read the label to make sure that you have a lice comb. this type of comb will have tooth spacing of 0.2-0.3mm in order to capture the smallest lice. it may also be black to help you more effectively identify individual louse. avoid getting a nit comb, because they often cannot detect individual louse or lice as well as lice combs.remember that regular combs are also not suitable for detecting lice. they don’t effectively detect lice and might even reintroduce lice back into your hair.; , use a regular comb to straighten and detangle your hair. this prepares your hair for using the lice comb. in addition, it may also help you more effectively detect lice.consider wrapping a towel around your shoulders to catch falling hair that may have lice. this may keep lice from transferring to other people or areas of your home. throw away the comb after using it to prevent re-infestation or transmission to another person. wash and dry the towel by itself on the hottest settings possible to prevent transmission or re-infestation., systematically combing through all of your hair minimizes the risk of not seeing lice. pulling your hair into individual sections can ensure that you comb your entire head. use clips or hair bands to create individual sections. remove the clips or bands before you comb a new section. make sure to throw away any hair bands and sterilize clips after use to prevent re-infestation or transmission to others. , once a regular comb moves easily through the hair, run the lice detection comb through your hair. make sure to comb each individual section so that you don’t miss any lice.comb each section of hair from the scalp to the end three to four times. repeated combing can ensure you effectively detect any lice in your hair. be aware that lice will quickly move away from any disturbance in dry hair. wet lice remain still, which is why wet combing may be more effective at detecting lice., as you comb each section, make sure to examine the comb for individual louse with each pass.lice may look like dandruff, hair product residue, other small insects, or beads of dead hair tissue.examine hair under a bright light or with a magnifying glass to best see any lice. trap lice that you find between your thumb and the comb. this prevents the louse from getting free or static electricity from your hair from repelling it. put the louse on a piece of tape and then throw it away to prevent transferring lice to another person. , if you find a live louse, you can be confident that an active infestation is present. however, if you are unsure about something you’ve found, attach it to a piece of tape, put it in a ziploc bag, and take it to a pharmacist, doctor, or other healthcare professional to confirm a case of lice.take steps to", "to begin with, you can use a portable lightweight field box. it should be small and sturdy; easy to travel around with. you buy it empty and fill it up with your own choice of colours. it makes a good investment and if you change your mind about the colours that you have bought, it is easy enough to change them. alternately, watch for artist grade field box sets on clearance or deep discount sales. if the color range has two yellows, two reds, two blues, a gold color like yellow ochre, a reddish brown and a dark brown then the set will give you the basic colors you need. one or two greens in it may be useful. white is \"body color\" that may be useful for adding light details on dark areas. if you want to change the colors later, \"half pans\" of pan watercolor are all the same size so you can pull out a color you don't use much and replace it with a new one you've learned to love. sometimes a set with a good field box is cost effective even if it's more than getting the same colors in a simple box if it's well designed and has extra features like a water bottle, snap in travel brush, folding palette sections. watch for those on sale and if you're not fond of the paints, feel free to swap in half pans of good paint in other brands. \"full pans\" are larger and take the space of two half pans in a watercolor box. you can also refill empty half pans from tubes of watercolor paint. if you change the color or brand, be sure to rinse out the remnants of the old paint before adding more. fill it, let it dry and see the surface sink. then add more till it's filled up by pouring. if it's the same brand you can add more before it's completely empty. if you live in a very hot and dry climate, the best option would be to purchase tube colour paints. or if you're fond of using paint strong, direct from the tube. some painters prefer using tube paints for their consistency. use tube watercolour paints on a plastic, lightweight palette; it's easy to hold and not too heavy. these palettes are also good if you prefer bringing more colors out into the field, they have many small slants to hold paint and large mixing areas in the middle once open. at home a large palette with a cover may be convenient. porcelain palettes are expensive in large sizes but also come in smaller forms like the traditional seven well \"flower palette.\" porcelain has the advantage that it never stains, weighs more and is less likely to get knocked off the table. plastic is lightweight. covered palettes may let you keep paint moist rather than letting it dry out completely, though most watercolors will reactivate if you put water on the dried blob and let it soak for an hour. the bigger boxes are more suitable for indoors, as", "there are many different herbs that can be used in a poultice, but they are often divided into three categories. a poultice may be one of the following types:astringent. astringent poultices cause your skin to contract, which can be helpful if you need to remove splinters or fragments of foreign objects. astringent poultices may also be helpful in to drawing out an infection. astringent herbs include witch hazel, oak bark, yarrow, and flax. these herbs can be used fresh or dried. activated charcoal, baking soda, and bentonite clay may be used as well. heating. a heating poultice is used to increase circulation to an area, thus increasing the warmth of the area. this type of poultice can relax muscles, relieve congestion in the lungs and sinuses, and help relieve sprains and strains. mustard and onions are most commonly used in a heating poultice. vulnerary. in herbal medicine, a vulnerary is an herb that promotes wound healing. they are usually a bit gooey because they contain mucilaginous and oily material in order to soothe and protect the wound. fresh herbs are best as vulneraries, but powdered or dried herbs can be used as well. the most commonly used vulnerary herbs are comfrey, marshmallow, flax, slippery elm, okra, and plantain.; , different herbs can be included in a poultice to address the symptoms you're attempting to treat. the medicinal properties of different herbs vary, so it's helpful to invest in a handbook or field guide about local flora so that you can get a better sense of what's available and how it can be used.most herbal remedies are unverified and based mostly on historical anecdotes and folk stories. that doesn't mean that they don't work, only that they have not yet been medically confirmed and should be used in conjunction with traditional medicine. , one of the most commonly grown and used herbs for use in poultices is mint, which is especially useful in treating congestion and other respiratory issues. fresh mint makes an effective and pleasant-smelling poultice on the chest to help with upper-respiratory issues or congestion. peppermint, wintergreen, and other common mints are all effective when used this way. herbs that have a similar effect and could be used to replace mint include lavender, lemon balm, calendula, and licorice root. , skin dryness or oiliness are commonly treated with a combination of these three herbs. containing similar fatty acids and phytonutrients, these herbs can be somewhat effective at helping to clear up skin condition, along with regular washing with soap and warm water.use a poultice of these fresh herbs as a home remedy for acne, eczema, psoriasis, and some mild rashes. , general pain or rheumatic discomfort may be treated with a poultice of goldenseal and slippery elm. other herbs used for similar afflictions include elderberry, fenugreek, flaxseed, slippery elm, and lobelia. slippery elm in particular is valuable in treating inflammation, displaying protective, emollient, expectorant, diuretic, and nutritive properties in healing. slippery elm contains a significant amount of nutrition, comparable to oatmeal.in the american south, a poultice made from goldenseal combined with", "there are myriad school supplies you could need for your classes, especially your freshman year, since you will likely be taking a variety of general courses. make sure to bring whatever you might need to be successful. generally, you’ll at least want to make sure you bring a planner, calculator, binders, notebooks, folders, flash drive, and lots of pens and highlighters.; , one of your goals in college is most likely to perform well in your classes. to do this, bring study aids that will help you focus. while these can be different for every person, there are a few general aids that will help you be successful. laptop “feet” raise the bottom of your laptop so that it is in a more comfortable position to work. an extension cord will give you the freedom to work anywhere in your room that you feel comfortable. just in case your roommate is not on your schedule, it is a good idea to bring a small reading light so you can continue studying while they are sleeping., bringing the right electronics is also important. while you may have any number of small electronic gadgets, in general, you’ll want to make sure you have the following: laptop computer. when searching for a laptop, make sure it has all the capabilities you’ll need to complete your work, including the right operating system, enough storage, and the appropriate inputs. for example, if you’re a business student, having microsoft office will be essential. it is also important to keep size in mind. if you plan to leave it in your room, a larger laptop would be fine. however, if you plan to take it to the library or class on a regular basis, consider something small and compact. portable speakers are another common electronic college students should have. this will allow you to play music or re-play a lecture. remember to bring headphones too so you can do this without disturbing your roommate. make sure you bring your cell phone as well. you’ll need to keep in touch with friends, family, and your classmates. also bring extension cords, surge protectors, and 3-2 prong adapters. this will give you the versatility to work from wherever you’re most comfortable. check with your college to figure out if your room is equipped with wireless internet and if there are on-campus printers you can use. if not, be sure to bring an ethernet cable and a printer., you should be able to find a list of any special requirements for your major on your university’s website. if not, try contacting your advisor to find out any special items you might need. for example, those studying fine arts will likely need a case for art supplies and their own sketch pads while journalism majors might need a voice recorder or ap styleguide. in addition, review your class list and course descriptions to see if you need any special materials, like a certain software program or specialized calculator., just like different majors may require specific supplies, they may also require specific types of clothing.", "this will ensure that you are quick to find out about the latest 'gigs' in time to buy tickets. not all shows are advertised on the radio or paper. some ticket and tour sites allow you to sign up for cell updates whenever your favorite artists add new dates in your area.; ,, when you hear about a concert you're interested in, check ticket availability. many popular concerts may sell out before you get a chance to buy your tickets. don't assume it is sold out until you are told so by the venue talk to people with similar music interests as you. they are likely to know about upcoming shows. venues often release \"hold\" tickets a day or two before the show. these are tickets the band or promoter has \"held back\" and must be offered for sale if not used. keep checking back. bands that are growing in popularity may still be playing smaller venues. although this is a great time to see them you should plan on getting your tickets early as possible. , this will increase your safety and make for an altogether more enjoyable experience. start asking around when you hear about the show. coordinate who will buy the tickets since buying them individually will mean you sit apart. (unless it is a general admission show.) keep in contact with your friends after you've decided to go. make sure no one changes their minds or makes other plans and you buy a ticket for them. , either go through the venue website, the band website, an authorized ticket website or authorized ticket site, such as the box office. compare prices between websites to confirm you are getting your tickets at a reasonable price. booking online or in person will offer you the same chance for good tickets. spending the night outside the venue no longer offers the opportunities for good seats, unless general admission for this venue means standing room close to the stage. in this case, the earlier you get to the venue the higher the likelihood that you will be front and center. find out the date and time tickets go on sale and try to book at that time. online sites may offer bad seats for your first search. unless the show is a guaranteed sell out you can usually refresh the search a few times and find better tickets. if your under 18, have a parent or adult guardian purchase the tickets for you, this doesn't have to mean they spend their money, you can pay them back. buying smaller numbers of tickets will usually result in better seats. trying to buy 10 tickets at once will probably have nosebleed seats. purchases online require a credit card. box office purchases can usually use cash or credit. , you can avoid some fees by getting an e-ticket that you can print. these are easy to duplicate and since you don't know if it's valid until it is scanned people may shy away from buying your ticket should you need to sell. most venues offer", "a third-party merchant is a company that accepts credit card payments on your behalf for a processing fee. the merchant will check the card, process it, and send you a monthly payment for the amount you are owed. the merchant does most of the work for you, allowing you to focus on developing your products, services and customers.if you use a reputable third-party merchant, your customers are more likely to buy goods from you online if they know their credit card information will be secure and safe. this is why it is important that you do your research and look for a merchant that is trusted by business owners and consumers. credit card issuers, like mastercard, visa, discover, and american express, will also charge a fee for the use of their card in addition to the processing fees by the third-party merchants.; , a third-party merchant is a good option for businesses who do not want to have to pay high upfront fees for processing software and computer hardware to run transactions. many small businesses who process less than $1000 in transactions a month and want to have the option of running online payments as well as international sales will opt for a third-party merchant. possibly the biggest benefit of a third-party merchant is that many third-party merchants do not require credit checks, making them very appealing to businesses with low credit scores or poor credit histories.one of the biggest disadvantages of using a third-party merchant is that most merchants charge a higher percentage for each transaction than if you have your own online merchant account. this is why it may be useful to view third-party merchants as a stepping stone for your company to help you get started and set up. though you will initially pay higher setup fees and and software fees, having your own merchant account might be a better investment in the long term, especially if you can maintain a good credit score., as third-party merchants become more popular, the list of providers continues to grow. there are several third-party merchants that are more used than others. you should research several different merchants to find the one that is best for your business. most of these merchants allow you to sell products in person to customers at a brick-and-mortar location and online through an online store. several top third-party merchants include:paypal here: this is perhaps one of the most popular options for a third-party merchant. it is managed through the online-payment service paypal. you use paypal here by attaching a small blue triangle to your iphone, ipad, or android phone. you can also use paypal here through an app on your computer. the funds are either deposited into your paypal account directly or on a special debit mastercard account. customers can pay you by credit card or with their paypal account. square: this third-party merchant is also popular with online businesses and brick-and-mortar retail businesses. you use it by attaching a small white square to your iphone, ipad, or android phone or through a square app on your", "the single leg stand is done by standing with one arm placed on a table or any support you can find. carefully shift the weight of your body to the injured foot and then hold it there for 15 seconds if you can. if you can’t, just stand on your injured ankle for as long as you can—it will get easier with time and practice. as you progresses, try to stand on your injured foot for 45 seconds. do two sets of this exercise with 10 to 15 repetitions, two or three times a day. to make the leg stand as hard as possible, close your eyes while standing on a cushion. , the standing calf raise is done by standing up straight and then lifting your uninjured foot partially off the floor. your injured foot should have its heel lifted but your toes should remain on the floor, as if you were wearing high heels. try not to hold on to anything while you do this to increase your stability. do two sets of 10 or 15 reps, two to three times a day. , sit in a chair and raise your injured ankle up so that it is out in front of you. pretend that your big toe (or even your whole food) is a pen. write the alphabet in the air, keeping in mind that your ankle will most likely feel pretty stiff in the beginning—it will get easier with time and practice. once you have written the alphabet, try to write the alphabet backwards. , the windshield wiper is done by sitting on a chair with your foot flat on the floor facing straight. move your injured foot carefully inward then outward. your foot and ankle should reflect the way a windshield wiper moves back and forth across a window. do two sets of 10 to 15 reps, 2 to 3 times a day. , eversion refers to turning or moving your foot outward, while inversion means turning your foot in towards your body. you can do the eversion and inversion exercise by standing next to a leg table or door jamb. when doing the eversion, you push against the table leg or door jam with your foot and ankle. to do the inversion, put your foot on the other side of the table leg or door jam and pull it towards you.hold each push or pull for 2 to 3 seconds. do two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, two or three times a day. , you can also do eversion and inversion exercises with an elastic band. the same principle is applied. you loop the elastic band on your foot while the other end is tied on a heavy object. when doing the eversion, turn your foot away from your body. when doing the inversion, turn your foot towards the center of your body. do two sets of 10 to 15 reps, two or three times day. , if you have done this exercise and found it to be easy, make it harder by adding some", "don’t beat around the bush when you have a problem with your coworker. it is usually easier to address the problem as soon as it comes up, rather than stew over it or get someone else involved.be informal about it the first time you address the person. you could say, “hey, jack, i’ve been noticing that you’ve been returning the truck almost on empty lately. could you remember to bring it back with a full tank next time?” if the behavior continues after you have informally addressed your concern, you may need to ask your supervisor to intervene. follow your company’s rules on handling employee conflict resolution.; , it is important to listen to your coworkers needs respectfully and to try to see their point of view. it is also important to express yourself in a respectful manner. when discussing issues with a coworker, make sure you don’t make them feel defensive when you speak to them. you can do this by using “i” statements. the other person hears your reactions to the situation, not your accusations.instead of saying, “we are always waiting on you to get your portion of the work done,” you could use “i” language and say, “when the work isn’t in on time, i get really stressed out. i end up needing to work later to get caught up. so it’s really helpful to me if everyone can get the project back on the agreed-upon day.” you could say, “while i appreciate feedback, your comment on my work the other day felt very personal and upset me.” , you may or may not get along well with your supervisor, but keep the lines of communication open between the two of you as best you can. remember that it is part of your boss’ responsibility to ensure that you are in an environment that enables you to get your work done, so do not feel like you need to keep concerns from them.remember that you and your boss do not need to be friends, you just need to be able to work together. (this goes for all of your coworkers, too.) it’s okay to maintain a professional distance from the person if you don’t really care for them. if you are having a difficult time communicating and getting along with your boss, you may wish to bring your concerns to your hr department or, if you don’t have an hr department, talk to your boss’ supervisor. you could say, “ms. jones, i’m coming to you because i’ve been having some problems working with mr. roberts lately. i’m hoping you can help me figure out what to do.” if your boss doesn’t have a boss (for example, they run a small business), and you are having a difficult time working with them, it may be best you begin looking for another job. , if you are dealing with a coworker bullying or harassing you, be sure you are keeping track of all incidents with that person. record the date, time, what happened, and if there were any witnesses.be sure to", "bed liners, bed rail caps, and other additions can be incompatible with some covers. check with the tonneau cover manufacturer if possible, or follow these rules of thumb:if a bed liner gets in the way during installation, just cut a notch where you need to fit a clamp or other cover part. if the bed liner wraps over the rails and your tonneau cover lies between rails (instead of above them), the two parts might not both fit on your truck. most bed rail caps won't affect installation, but diamond plate bed rail caps will prevent some covers from fitting, or from forming a weather-tight seal.; , a closed tailgate can interfere with installation. , most tonneau covers come with two side rails, which fit onto the top or side of the truck's bed rails. place a side rail flush with the front of the bed rail, next to the cab. hold it in place temporarily with a spring clamp, or have an assistant keep hold of it. if your cover does not come with rails, the cover itself should have clamps that swing down from the underside once the cover is in place.these covers are less stable and not weatherproof, but easy to remove and reinstall. if you have a retractable tonneau cover, which comes in a canister, you may need to position this before you place the rails. put the canister on the edge of the bed rails, next to the cab. center this perfectly before you attach the rails to the canister., your installation kit should come with several toothed clamps. take one of these and fit it onto the underside of the side rail, near the cab. line up the teeth of the clamp with the grooves, then tighten by hand. tighten a few times with a wrench or socket wrench, just enough to feel it pressing against the bed rail., look at the underside of the rail. if there is any gap at all between the truck, place shims evenly along the bed rail to close the gap. these are plastic or rubber spacers that stick directly onto the bed rail. if there's a large gap (more than about ⅜ inches / 10mm), you might need shim brackets instead. unclamp the rail, slide the shim brackets onto the end, space them out evenly, and reclamp the rail.your kit may not come with shim brackets, or may have shim brackets that attach with a slightly different design. , most installation kits come with eight clamps (four per side), but a short bed may only require six (three per side). attach these the same way you did the first clamp, spacing them evenly along the rails. some soft tonneau cover instructions recommend skipping this step until the end, so you can make final adjustments more easily. don't try this for a hard cover, which needs a firm , install the second rail the same way. , the two rails should be perfectly parallel with each other, in line with the bed rails, and as far back as they can", "for a sleepless puppy, you can offer a warm blanket for sleeping. place a clock that makes a rhythmic ticking sound nearby. you can also try playing the radio softly or use a white noise machine to help the puppy sleep. consider using a heating pad under half of the crate to provide a warmer corner for cuddling. since the heating pad is outside and under the crate, the puppy should not be in any danger of chewing on the cord or pad.; , if you want your dog to sleep in a crate, but he isn't crate-trained it may take some time to get him used to the crate. do your research and be prepared to teach your dog that the crate is a good place. put special treats in the back of crate to encourage investigation. make sure that when you say \"kennel\" or \"crate\" you use a positive tone of voice. this tells him that going into the crate to sleep isn't a punishment. if you use it as a punishment, you may find that your dog never grows accustomed to the crate as a relaxing and quiet place. , your dog may be restless at night if he's not getting enough exercise during the day. depending on your dog’s breed, age and fitness level, you may be able to tire him out in 30 minutes or 3 hours (or more).you can exercise your dog at any time during the day that works with your schedule. although, it's best to avoid a lot of activity the last hour or two before bedtime so that your dog has a chance to settle down. consider playing a new sport or activity like nosework, rally, agility, tracking or flyball with your dog.new activities mean learning new skills for both of you. getting involved will increase mental and physical stimulation which helps both of you with exercise, boredom and will add to your bond. , make sure that your pet has had a chance to urinate and defecate right before bedtime. feed your dog dinner a few hours before bedtime. this gives him plenty of time to digest and eliminate. try keeping the hour or so before bedtime nice and calm which will set the tone for the night’s sleep to come. if your dog is overly anxious, try giving him adaptil. this is a product that replicates the pheromones of a nursing mother dog and may help settle your dog or puppy by reducing anxiety., any changes in sleeping arrangements may take a while to get used to. making sure that your dog gets plenty of exercise to the point of being tired is a great way to ensure a good night’s sleep for you two. talk to your vet about using an antihistamine like benadryl to help settle your dog for a few nights during a transitional period. , perhaps there are other issues causing a bit of unrest in your dog. are you packing for a trip or moving? are there guests in the house? a new neighbor? loud noises?", "you can start with two empty toilet paper rolls or one empty paper towel roll. if you use the paper towel roll, cut it in half. refer to each half as a separate roll for the remainder of the instructions. cut one of the rolls in half. save one half for use as the cow's head and discard the other half. cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) off one end of the other roll. this roll will become the body of the cow. discard the excess 1 inch (2.5 cm). , using pencil, lightly sketch two ovals onto one end of the head piece, positioning them on opposite sides of the cylindrical perimeter. these ovals will become ears. each one should be about one-quarter the length of the tube. carefully cut along three-quarters of each oval outline, leaving the innermost end of each oval alone. fold up the cut portions so that they stick out from the sides of the tube, creating ears. , draw two small triangles near one end of the tube, centering them in between both ears. these triangles will become horns. they should be smaller than half the size of one ear. carefully cut along two edges of each triangle, leaving the innermost edge alone. fold up the cut portions so that they stick out from the side of the tube, creating horns. , cut two compartments out of an empty egg carton. discard the rest of the carton. these two sections will become the legs of your cow. one section will form both front legs and the other will form both back legs. carefully cut out the front and back of both sections, leaving the sides and bottoms intact. , paint both cardboard tubes and both egg carton sections white. allow the paint to dry. you should paint both sides of the ear slits, but you do not need to paint the horn slits at this time. , use black paint to add spots to the head and body of the cow. let the paint dry when finished. to create realistic spots, paint spots with uneven sides. avoid sharp points, opting for rounded corners instead. note that you should also space the spots apart in uneven intervals instead of creating patterns or symmetry. , paint a small pink oval in the front side of each ear. paint both sides of each horn gray. let the paint dry. the pink inner ear should follow the outline of the ear slit, but you should leave some blank white space around the edge of each center. , using craft glue, adhere two googly craft eyes onto the face. allow the glue to dry completely. both eyes should lie just in front of the ears along the length of the head. place each eye in between one horn and one ear along the width (perimeter) of the head. , glue both egg carton pieces onto the same side of the body roll. glue the head onto the opposite side of the body roll. turn both carton sections upside-down so that the flat", "xbox one has several connections to the unit which will need to be made first. these include the new kinect sensor, internet connection, and your set-top box if you wish to view your cable tv shows through the xbox one.; , before you do anything, one thing you have to be sure of is that your console is connected to the internet. you can do a wired connection by using an ethernet cable to connect it to your internet source or you can also connect wirelessly if you have a wifi router available. , use an hdmi cable to connect your xbox one to your tv. connect the hdmi cable to the hdmi out port at the rear portion of the xbox one. the other end of the hdmi cable goes in the hdmi input of your tv. if you have cable or satellite tv, you can connect another hdmi cable into your console’s hdmi in port and the other end goes to your set-top box for cable or satellite tv. , connect your kinect into the kinect port at the back of the xbox one. it is the port in between the usb ports and ir port. the kinect sensor cable has a fixed length of 3 meters (9.8 ft) so make sure that your kinect sensor is close enough to your xbox one. , plug the power supply at the back of the xbox one into a power source. it is at the leftmost part of the console from the back. then connect the power cord to the power supply. lastly, plug in the other end of the power cord straight to your power outlet. the xbox one’s led on the power supply should light up as an indication that there’s power. , you can turn on your unit by using your wired controller. simply hold down the home button on your xbox one controller to power on both your unit and controller at the same time. you can also touch the front panel of the xbox one (where its logo is) to power on the unit. if you are using a wireless controller, make sure you put in batteries first to power on your controller. the kinect sensor can also be used to turn on your console except during initial setup. you can normally turn on your xbox one via the kinect sensor by saying “xbox on” within your kinect sensor’s range. , the first thing you’ll see on-screen is the xbox one logo with a green background. wait for it to process a bit and it will eventually give you initial setup instructions. the first instruction is for you to press a to proceed. it gives you that instruction by showing an xbox one controller on-screen. then xbox one greets you for the first time. , there are a lot of languages available to choose from including english, deutsch, español, and more when you scroll down the options. select your preferred language then press a. you will notice that xbox one on-screen texts automatically translate to the language", "it’s important to do a little research before you allow your child to download applications and use them. for one, know what the age limits are for certain apps or social media sites. if you know an application may be risky or dangerous, do not allow your child to download it. if they do want to download an application, have them state their reasons why they’d like to use it and any potential dangers it may have. most social media websites restrict young children from registering. a child must be 13 or older to use facebook, twitter, instagram, tumblr, snapchat, and pinterest. youtube’s age requirement is 18, but if a child is 13 or older they can sign up with parental permission. yoursphere (a kids social network) is designed specifically for children’s safety and privacy. , you can purchase tools to monitor your child’s phone activity from your own phone or computer. these programs tend to be extensive in the information you can see, so adjust what content on your child’s cell phone you want to monitor. if you have multiple children with a cell phone, many programs allow customization for up to five cell phones.some programs let you log on to check activity, while others also allow you to set up alerts to your child’s activity. , some parents may want all location services turned off to protect their child’s privacy. this can keep applications from sharing their location or disallowing “checking in”. others parents, however, may want to use software to track where their child is at a given time. if you’re concerned your child says they’re going one place yet are suspicious you are going somewhere else,

track another phone. , decide how you will handle their social media accounts. you may choose to not let them install social media applications on their phone and only let them use social media on the family computer. decide what accounts they are allowed to have and as always, toggle the security settings to protect their privacy. for a younger child or for a child who may be at a higher risk, have their social media passwords so that you can monitor their activity. as they get older or more mature, you may wish to relax your rules.friend or follow your child on their social media accounts. this is a step down from having their passwords, yet still allows you to see what they’re doing and posting. however, beware if your child sets up a different or secret account that you do not follow., if you’re monitoring your child’s phone, look out for any inappropriate content. this can occur over social media or messaging applications. inappropriate content can occur in comments, posts, emails, texts, or photos. it can also be an image your child shares. if your child posts something inappropriate, have them remove it right away. if necessary, have them", "most teachers give their students a chance to bring up questions and concerns at the end of a lesson. hold onto your question until you’re prompted for it. that way, your teacher will be able to reach a good stopping point and give you a detailed answer. familiarize yourself with the way things are normally done in your classroom. your teacher might encourage students to ask questions during the lesson, or they may prefer that you save them for a designated time. if the teacher doesn’t invite questions, wait for a pause before asking.; , this is the most common and courteous way of letting your teacher know that you have a question. raising your hand lets you signal quietly so that you don’t interrupt the lesson or disturb your classmates. it will also help you get noticed in a room full of students.keep your hand up until your teacher acknowledges you. they may not see you right away. don’t wave your arm around in an effort to be seen. this can be very distracting. , if your teacher fails to notice that you have your hand up, you can politely alert them before you get left behind in the lesson. simply say “excuse me,” or get their attention by saying their name. wait until you’re called on before you begin talking.be respectful. pestering or talking over your teacher will just make you look like you’re trying to cause a scene. , you may already have the information you need to find out what it is you want to know. before you ask a question, think it over and make sure it’s something you can’t find out on your own. review your textbook and notes and look for the answer there. learning to search for answers independently can improve your study habits and make you more resourceful. it can be somewhat embarrassing to ask a question when the answer is right in front of you. , a lot of students tend to be shy about asking questions, but there’s no reason to be. think of questions as a tool you can use to make learning more effective. even if the answer is a simple one, the fact that you had the presence of mind to ask will show that you’re engaged with the course material.chances are, someone else in the class has the same question and is too timid bring it up.once you’ve gotten comfortable expressing yourself in class, you’ll be more confident about asking questions in the future., articulate your words and make sure the teacher and the rest of the class can hear you. that way, you won’t be forced to repeat yourself. you should talk loud enough to be heard clearly, but try not to shout. muttering or talking under your breath may make you hard to hear. , there’s no need to ramble on and on or preface the question with other sorts of statements. make it short and to the point. your teacher will be better able to answer you, and you won’t lose any important class", "consider the stitch size setting and thread tension you will need for sewing your particular fabric. if you are unsure, consult the directions for your sewing machine and adjust settings accordingly. also prepare your sewing machine by threading it with a thread that matches the color and strength of the material you are going to sew. this is also a good time to plug in your iron, so that it's already heated up when you need it.; , putting the wrong sides together is the opposite of what is normally done when sewing a basic seam, so don't worry if it feels counterintuitive. a french seam requires you to stitch each seam twice, folding over your first line of stitches in order to make your finished seam face the right direction. be sure to pin all the way down the seam you are sewing. this will help to make sure your fabric doesn't slip out of line. it's a good idea to put pins in so they are perpendicular to your seam line, this way they won't stick you as you move the fabric along in the sewing machine and they will be easy to grab as you move your fabric in the sewing machine. , to keep your seam allowance the same width as you sew your seam, keep an eye on the seam allowance guide that should be printed on the thread plate of your machine. another option is to use a 1/4 inch presser foot, that way you can just make sure the outer edge of your fabric always lines up with the edge of the presser foot. the seam allowance is the amount of fabric that is between the edge of the fabric and the seam. patterns usually give a specific amount of seam allowance to use, so that your finished project doesn't turn out too bit or too small. remember that the french seam will basically require about double the allowance you use on this first seam, so make sure when you are cutting out your pieces of fabric that you have figured that into your measurements. feel free to increase the seam allowance on this first seam to 3/8 inch, if you are more comfortable sewing that width, but keep in mind that you will need to increase your overall seam allowance to accommodate this. it's best to remove pins right before you are about to sew over them. this will keep the fabric in place but will avoid the risk of hitting one with your sewing machine needle, which could easily break the needle. remember to clip any threads and remove any remaining pins after sewing. , you can use regular scissors or pinking shears, but if you are using a delicate fabric, pinking shears may be best to help prevent excessive fraying. remember, this seam is not going to show by the time you are finished. don't worry if the cut edge is a bit frayed or messy. while it would be great if you could just sew a 1/8 inch seam, and therefore", "as you pray, allow yourself to be moved by god’s power and grace. pray with an open and receptive heart. don’t subdue your emotions—let them out! when you feel moved to tears, allow yourself to cry. when you feel

for you! everyone is at a different point in their spiritual journey. there is more than 1 way to connect to god.; , place your faith in god and trust that god will answer your prayers. remain positive throughout your prayer. avoid negative phrases including “i know this is a long shot…” and negative thoughts. when you don’t trust in god’s capabilities, you are praying with a doubtful heart. confess your fears and doubts to god. allow your passionate faith and blind trust in god remove the burden of doubt from your heart. remain focused on what god is capable of accomplishing. be comforted by the knowledge that god is a loving, all-powerful being.when a doubt or fear arises, don’t wallow in it. let it go! do not allow yourself to worry over whether or not your desire will come true. simply trust that you've done everything you can to make it happen. turn to god in prayer and ask that god alleviate you from the doubt or fear., find a meaningful way to personally thank god. praise god in prayer, thought, and deed. thank god with a prayerful song, a thought of thanksgiving, or with a kind act. praise god for his guidance and wisdom. thank god for calming your fears, for alleviating your self-doubt, and for giving you hope. praise god for his faithfulness and commitment to you. sing his praises when your life is at its highest of highs and its lowest of lows. be grateful to god in all that you do.thank god for what he has done in the lives of others. , come to god in prayer until something happens! pray constantly. ask god for guidance and healing around the clock, not just when it is convenient for you to do so. pray on your commute, for five minutes at your desk, and at recess or lunch. asking persistently for a miracle demonstrates your commitment. when you pray, be persistent about listening to god too. listen for god’s guidance. actively seek his advice.devote an entire morning, day, or week to persistent prayer. free yourself from distractions. go to a park, sit by a lake, sit in a sanctuary, or retire to your bedroom. make sure to listen to god’s will and directions too!, don’t be afraid to state what you want in clear and simple language. ask god for the miracle. it is acceptable to be", "when a girl likes you, she will face in your direction. if a girl has her torso turned towards you in an open manner, this means that she is confident talking with you. if she has a closed body position, namely crossed arms or legs, she may be shy or nervous to talk to you or she may simply be creating a barrier to signal that she is uninterested.when she is sitting with her legs crossed, watch her feet. if they are pointed towards you, it might mean that she likes you and wants to get closer to you.; , if a girl likes you, she will tend to either hold her gaze on you for a few seconds or glance down the moment your eyes make contact with hers. either of these responses could mean that she likes you. if she pulls away quickly, it often means she is nervous or not ready to reveal her true intentions yet, but she may still like you. when a girl likes you, her pupils might dilate, though this will be hard to tell.if you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, this could mean that she likes you. , the way you interpret a girl's body language will vary depending on the context. for example, if you're talking one-on-one with a girl, her touching your arm for a few seconds could be considered flirting. however, if she quickly taps your shoulder to get your attention and tell you that your friend is looking for you, she may really just be trying to help, not flirt. if you are having an intense conversation, a girl may look at you without breaking eye contact. this does not necessarily mean she likes you. it could just be a conversational practice of hers. however, if she makes eye contact with you for an extended period of time without talking, or if she looks at you and breaks away the minute you look back at her, she may be intrigued by you. , when a girl likes you, she will often try to touch you, as this is a noticeable yet still subtle way to flirt. it allows a girl to size up how responsive you are. she may touch your arm when you say something funny, “accidentally” brush your shoulder or hands with hers, or gently place her hand on your knee. not all girls will feel comfortable reaching out using touch. in this case, don't assume that she doesn't like you just because she doesn't try to touch you. she may be too nervous to do so. if you like her, don't be shy––break the touch barrier yourself and see how she responds. she may also find other reasons to touch you, such as softly punching your arm. these \"one-of-the-mates\" moves can be a thinly disguised way of getting closer to you without it being too evident to your friends and hers. , this is especially significant if her random hugs are reserved mostly for you. hugs are a", "you can purchase dust powder or bathing sand from a pet store. these may be for rabbits or chinchillas, but can be used for the hamster., pick a container that is made of ceramic, but is fairly shallow. these containers should not be easily overturned. fill the container enough to allow the entire animal space to roll in it. allow the hamster a few minutes to roll around in the sand., use a soft brush or clean hold the hamster in one hand, or let a helper hold them rag. gently dust off the hamster with the soft brush or rag.avoid the eyes, ears, and mouth. use quick, light strokes. , clean the dish out thoroughly with water, and towel dry it to make sure it’s completely dry before a later use.use a fresh batch of dust or sand each time , if brushing and bathing doesn’t improve your long haired hamster’s fur then you may resort to trimming. avoid holding the hamster on its back while you do this. keep it held in your hand or the hand of a helper. use a small pair of scissors to trim just a little at a time from the matted fur.trimming may even be preferable to the hamster feed the hamster a small piece of fruit or vegetable to keep it calm during the process. , get a shampoo specifically designed for hamsters or small pets from a pet store or pet aisle. set some towels around to protect against splashing.make sure you’re in an area you don’t mind getting wet like a sink or basin. wet baths are usually not a great idea for hamster’s as they can remove essential oils from the hamster’s coat. , use a soft grooming brush. hold the hamster in one hand, or let a helper hold them. pour a little of the shampoo onto the brush with some warm water. work it into the hamster’s fur with brief light stokes.avoid the eyes, mouth, and ears. , use a soft towel. you can cradle the hamster in the towel as long as the hamster has support, and feels safe. make sure to gently pad down all of the hamster’s fur so it’s dry. don’t be so rough you scrape the skin.if the hamster seems to be panicking or squirming then revert to the single hand-held method. , check for drafts. you want to make sure the hamster is not exposed to any cold air vents, wind, fans, or anything else that might make it cold while wet. you need to leave it in this warm place until its fur is completely dry.you might want to leave some rags, treats, and toys for the hamster to have while it waits. , use a pair of small human nail clippers or nail clippers designed for a pet such as a cat. hold the hamster in one hand or the hand of a helper and clip the lower tips of the nails. you want to take extra care not to clip too far up the nail and risk clipping a", "duct tape comes in a variety of colors. you may buy your duct tape at a hardware store or find a greater variety of colors and patterns at an arts and crafts store. you may also find unique designs online.; , create fabric out of duct tape by cutting 16 strips of duct tape that measure 32 inches (81.3 cm) long and 2 inches wide. this will create 2 sheets of fabric, one for each panel of your tie as conventional ties are commonly constructed using two panels., place the strips on a flat surface with the sticky side up. lay one horizontally and the next one beside it but overlap the edge slightly. continue to do this until you have four strips wide., place strips of duct tape over the four adjoining strips so that the sticky portions face one another. measure and lay down each strip with purpose as the tape will be difficult to adjust once two sticky faces are pushed together. once you have 8 strips, 4 on each side, you finished a single panel of fabric., a traditional tie is composed of 2 panels that make up the top of the tie and the neck portion. create a second panel of fabric for the second part of the tie by, again, overlapping 4 strips of duct tape and closing the panel with another 4 strips., choose a tie that is a size you’re looking for, don’t choose a thick tie if you want a thin tie. smooth the fabric so that it lays flat onto one of the panels., use a pencil or sharpie to trace the tie but be careful not to stain your cloth tie. make sure that you press hard enough to see the outline but not hard enough to puncture the duct tape. felt works well but may easily be smudged if not careful., each panel should be use for a different part of you old tie. use the second panel for the neck portion of your tie. again, spread the fabric out flat onto the second duct tape panel., using a pencil or marker, trace the skinny portion of your tie onto the second panel of duct tape fabric. if your tie is skinny the entire length, the neck portion is the part of your tie that will be closest to your chest and most likely covered by the other portion of fabric., use scissors to cut out both pieces of your tie from the duct tape fabric. cut carefully as you do not want to damage the main pieces. if you used a marker, you can choose to include the outline to give a bold silhouette., tape the ends of the tie that will be closest to your face. depending on the design you have chosen, the end of your tie may be angled. in this case, the points of your tie should be away from your face, pointed toward your feet and not be taped together.it is common to use the same color duct tape to tape the 2 portions", "chain heal is rehgar’s q ability, which heals a target ally and heals up to two other allies for around half the original amount; prioritizing heroes over minions or summons. this ability is pretty straightforward, although you need to be quick and accurate enough to heal your ally just when he or she needs it the most. the 9 second cooldown, however, means that you need to pick your targets very carefully. this is why you need to prioritize allies that are being focused down by the enemy to keep them alive. , lightning shield is rehgar’s w ability, which places a buff on the target that damages nearby enemies and damages nearby enemies over the duration of lightning shield. this ability is great when used on melee heroes that can stick close to their target, as it gives them bonus damage that can force enemies to retreat from the continuous damage over time effect. this is especially effective when used on tough heroes that can “stick” to the enemy. (e.g. arthashastra, diablo, chen, stiches etc.), earthbind totem is rehgar’s e ability, which creates a totem on the target area that slows nearby enemies over its lifespan. this ability makes rehgar a powerful ally when roaming the map to ambush isolated heroes, especially when partnered with another hero that can disable targets from afar and buy time for rehgar to drop his totem right on their heads. it is also devastating against enemy teams that clump up together during team fights; making it easier for your team to get in position and destroy enemies caught in the totem’s area of effect. and finally, the totem itself has a respectable sight radius, which you can exploit by dropping the totem along enemy paths of approach to spot them if they try to flank you or your teammates., bloodlust is rehgar’s first ultimate, which significantly boosts the attack and movement speeds of nearby allies when activated. of course, heroes that rely on basic attacks to deal most of their damage (e.g. illidan, raynor, tychus etc.) will benefit the most from bloodlust, but the attack and movement speed buffs will still be immensely useful for your entire team. the added speed is the true clincher here, as it gives you and your teammates an advantage in positioning; making it easier to chase down fleeing enemies or fall back when taking too much damage., ancestral healing is rehgar’s second ultimate ability, which heals a single target hero for a massive amount of health after a short delay. this ultimate ability can give your ally a second life, which is especially useful for warriors that lead the charge and absorb a large chunk of damage for the team. just remember that it takes about two seconds for the heal to kick in. the cooldown will trigger as you cast ancestral healing – regardless of whether your target is healed or not. this means you need to cast ancestral healing when the target has lost enough health to make it count but not before the target dies while", "this is obvious; how are you going to be a tumblr boy if you don’t have access to the right materials? you won’t. easy answer. sign up as follows: go to the main page of the tumblr website. click the sign-up button. this will redirect you to another screen with the email and password requirements, just like on every other site you visit. enter a legit email address, and choose a unique url. try to pick a name that someone would be more likely to remember; don’t go and use a bunch of symbols – people won’t remember that. if it’s possible, pick something that is derived from another language, or is a play on words in your own. that way, it will be intriguing to other people, and they will be more inclined to inquire about it. don’t worry though – if you think it’s crappy, you can always change it later.; , there will be a myriad of themes thrown at you at first; if you are overwhelmed, pick a basic one for now – as above, you can always change it later. pick a theme that correlates with your own interests; if that means you have to make your own from scratch (although that takes skill in coding), so be it. this is an extra terrific idea, since if your blog catches on, people can request to use your theme. , the most used and cliché thing you can hear about tumblr is “make your posts unique!” even though it’s not very unique to make them unique anymore, it’s still important. even if you are trying to show off for other people, you are still the one making the posts and uploading the content. if all you do is repost, then not only will that tarnish your blogging rep, you’ll be as bland as a banana – and people will look right through that. as the wise how to be tumblr famous puts it: “you can make original text posts. this means writing meta about television shows or books, if that's your niche, or dissecting bad literature. it means putting your opinions and your ideas out there for people to see. that may seem scary, but, even if people don't agree with your ideas, they'll still be engaging you and then other people will see and be intrigued.” , with the amazing feature of the queue, you can post even when you’re not around. posting new, fresh, and original content is a must, no matter if you’re a scientist or a sociologist. , taking care of your body will become a breeze if you follow this simple rule. chugging a one-liter of coke and downing 25 pizza rolls after school every day won’t help you on your road to tuml-boydom. having a lean it fit body is essential. , that means taking a shower every day, plus washing your face after school – especially if you are acne prone. tumblr boys usually are devoid of acne, so get that treated first thing. there are so many products out there", "the power supply is what powers all of the components inside of your computer. it will need to provide enough power so that all of the components can function properly. it will also need to have the correct connectors for your hardware. make sure that the wattage of the power supply is sufficient for the hardware you have installed. the cpu and the graphics card will draw the most power. if the power supply is not sending out enough power, your computer may run sluggishly or not at all. modern hard drives and optical drives require sata connectors for power. all modern power supplies have these connectors. some of the more powerful video cards require two pci-e connectors. make sure that your power supply can accommodate everything that you need to connect. some cases have non-standard housings for power supply. ensure that the power supply you purchase will fit in the case. atx cases should work with all atx power supplies, and matx cases will need a matx power supply.; , laying the case on its side will typically provide the best access to the power supply housing. if there is an existing power supply, make sure that it is unplugged before opening the case. , in order to access the housing, you may need to remove some of your components, such as the cpu fan. this will depend on your case layout. , most housings allow you to slide the power supply in, and it will usually only fit one way. make sure that any fans on the power supply are not blocked, and that you can screw it in from the back with all four screws. if you can’t, then the power supply may be inserted incorrectly. mount the power supply securely with all four screws before moving on. you can use standard atx case screws if the power supply didn’t come with any. , once the power supply is secured, you can start wiring the interior of the computer. take your time to ensure that no component is forgotten, and to place the wires in a way that doesn’t interfere with system fans or cooling. you will likely have more connectors that places to connect to; try to tuck these extra cables out of the way. connect the 20/24 pin connector to the motherboard. this is the largest connector on the power supply. most modern motherboards require the 24-pin connector, while older motherboards will only use the first 20 pins. some power supplies have a detachable 4-pin connector to make connecting old motherboards easier. connect the 12v power to the motherboard. older motherboards use a 4-pin connector, while newer ones use an 8-pin. this powers the processor, and should be clearly marked on the cable or in your power supply’s documentation. connect your graphics card. mid- and high-end graphics cards will require one or multiple 6- and 8-pin connectors. these will be marked as pci-e connectors. connect your drives. most drives use sata power connectors, which are thin plugs. if you have older drives, then you will need to", "it's best if you know the person's first, middle, and last name. knowing this information will make him or her easier to find. because some combinations of first and last names are common, it's easier to narrow down if you have a middle name, too. you can find a person's full name by looking through family documents if you have them. try family bibles, baptismal records, or birth certificates. you can also try contacting the church if you know the person or family was connected to one church for a long time. many churches keep baptismal records.; , if you don't know the date of death, you can try searching the obituaries of local newspapers where the person lived. you can usually find some information on the person in the obituary, such as the date of birth, the date of death, and the names of the person's parents and descendants. you may luck out and find the location of the grave, as well.if you only have a name, you can try searching national archives of newspapers. often times, your local library will have access to these databases.if you can't find this information, some websites will accept a date range for the death date.the date of birth is also helpful to keep on hand if you have it, as it can narrow down results. , if you're having no luck finding the date of death, try looking at city directories and even phone books. if the person is listed one year, but not the next, you can narrow down the year of death., the place of death is often included in the obituary. if you know the city and state, you can also look up the county, which some websites request when you are trying to find information.if you can get a copy of the death certificate, the place of death will also be listed on it.try asking family members. family members are a good source for this information, as they usually know where a person was living when she died. if no one knows, ask for old bibles, as in the past, families used to record births and deaths in bibles, including the place of death.old letters can also be a good source of information. also, newspaper clippings are often saved by family members, including obituaries. you can also try searching legal documents. for instance, probate records are often a good way to find out where a person died because many estates go into probate after death., if you're having trouble finding some of this information, the cdc lists the departments in each state that handle these kinds of records. you can request a copy of the death certificate from these departments, which will give you information such as the date of death and the cause of death. you will likely have to pay a fee for the copy of the death certificate.depending on the state, you may need to prove you are a family member of the deceased because some states have closed vital records, which includes death certificates. for instance,", "at large parties with a lot going on, it can get overwhelming and your natural reaction might be to space out. trying to pay attention to everything means paying attention to nothing. actively fight this tendency. be in the moment you are in, and find a way to shut out all the other people besides the ones you are specifically with.if you go through the whole party trying to focus on everything that is going on, you won’t actually experience any of it directly. allow yourself to forget about all the extra stuff that’s around you and enjoy the thing you are currently doing. once you find someone and are hanging out with them, don’t look around the rest of the room to see what everyone else is doing. pay attention to only what you are doing, at least for a while. , it’s a good idea to have your phone, and you can even check it periodically, but don’t spend the whole night looking at the screen. you can watch your phone sitting at home alone, but you don’t always get to be out with people doing stuff. rather than thinking of all the other stuff you could be doing, enjoy the party you are at. plus, if the party is rowdy at all, there’s always the chance you could lose or break your phone and you don’t want to do that. , with people all over the place and the host or hostess often busy keeping things going, offer to help them out by getting people food, refilling the punch bowl, or keeping tabs on the music situation. if there is an ipod or something playing, see if you can play dj for a while and pick the jams for everyone to dance to. , bigger parties tend to span across multiple rooms and could even include the porch, patio, or the back yard. making sure that you move throughout the various spaces of the party will increase the number of people that see you there. this gives you the opportunity to interact with as many people as possible rather than just those in one spot.if you have been in one place for a while, mention that you are going to check out another room or go outside. you can specifically mention someone that you want to go talk to, or you can say you are going for food or a drink. the people who you are talking with will be less likely to think you are just ditching them. they may even think that you are more important because you have other people you plan to see. it may feel more comfortable to stick with the location and group of people that you already secured, but being the life of the party means being seen by more people. later on, the guests will most likely not remember the person who sat on the couch the whole time, but they will remember someone who they saw moving throughout the entire party the whole night. , high school parties can range", "fill the mold to the line drawn earlier using warm tap water. ideally, the temperature should be around 105 °f (41 °c). use a thermometer to maintain a good average temperature. making gelatin takes longer with warm water as opposed to hot, but results in a clearer final product. , the mixing process will take a significant amount of time, so make sure that you can comfortably mix for about twenty minutes. you’ll want to mix with a large spoon, wooden or metal. , use a 1-cup measuring cup to slowly add gelatin to the water. you need to be stirring constantly to avoid clumping. add all of the gelatin over the course of about 10 minutes, sprinkling one cup at a time. this step is much easier with two people. one person stirs, while the other slowly adds the gelatin. after the gelatin has been added, you can swap stirring duties to give your arm a break. to improve the clarity, you can add cinnamon oil to the gelatin. you will need about 9 drops; 1 drop per gallon of water. add the cinnamon oil about halfway through the stirring process. , after the stirring is complete, there will be a little bit of foam on the top of the mixture. gently scoops this out and discard. there should be no visible foam or clumps of undissolved gelatin in the final mix. , you want to cool the mixture to about 36 °f (2 °c). avoid freezing it, or else the blocks will become too cloudy. if you don’t get it cool enough, the gel will not get as dense as it needs to. cool the gel for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight. , once the gel has fully cooled, gently turn the container over onto a clean flat surface such as a kitchen counter. slowly guide the gel out of the container with your hands to help avoid cracking the block. , use a large kitchen knife to cut the block into two halves. cut the long way so that you are left with two narrow blocks with the dimensions 6 x 6 x 20. gently wrap each block completely in plastic wrap. this will prevent evaporation, which will affect the density and integrity of the block. after wrapping the block, place a stiff piece of cardboard on each block and wrap it again. the cardboard will make transporting the block much easier. store the blocks at 40 °f (4 °c) or cooler until you are ready to shoot them. transport the blocks in a cooler to help keep them at optimum density. , place the blocks on a stable flat surface. a piece of plywood on sawhorses will work. adjust the blocks so that you shoot into a 6 x 6 square end. if you are firing a high-powered gun, place a cement block behind the ballistics gel to keep the force from knocking the block off of the platform. always follow proper safety procedures when handling fierarms. be careful unwrapping the gel, you don’t want it to", "you'll need 1/4\" plywood for the back panels, 1x4 lumber for the stiles, 1x6 lumber for the baseboard, and 1x2 lumber for the rails. you'll need to rent a circular saw from your local big box hardware store to cut the lumber and panels to size. a laser lever, scrap wood for stile spacing, stud finder, pneumatic nail gun with 2.5\" and 1.5\" finishing nails, and other tools can also be helpful. , remove existing baseboards, chair rails or skirt moldings. you should also remove outlet plates. measure the linear footage of the room or wall with a tape measure in order to determine how much wood you will need. allow wood to acclimate in the room where it will be installed for at least 48 hours. this will prevent expansion and contraction of the paneling from occurring after installation. , establish a level line around the room for the top of the panels. measure the height of the room, divide that by 3, and create your panels to reach that height or close to it. once you've calculated the height, draw and then mark (with painter's tape works best) a level line around the room. a laser level will make this easiest. you may want to try to place the top edge of the panel just a little higher than the panel really is if you know that your floor is uneven. this will keep down the amount of trimming you need to do. shoe molding can always be placed at the bottom to hide gaps that occur with an uneven floor. , use a stud finder tool, or gently tap the wall with a hammer, to locate the wall studs and mark them just above the level line. if you can locate the utility lines, you should mark those on the wall as well, to help avoid hitting them with nails. utility lines are often found around water sources or immediately next to the studs closest to outlets and wall lights. be careful when nailing in these areas. , the size and orientation of your room will determine what your paneling looks like, so specific measurements unfortunately cannot be given. there are a few basic guidelines you should follow though, in order to figure out where everything should go: try to get at least a few stiles placed over a stud. this will help seal your panel to the wall. don't place a stile over an outlet or other unusual feature. this will only create more cutting and measuring for you. try to line up your stiles to cover gaps between panels, helping to hide the seam. set the spacing of your stiles in a way that looks good for the size of room you have. the smaller the room, the further apart the stiles should be. larger rooms can be spaced the same as studs: 16\" center-to-center. , add construction adhesive to the backs of the panels and place them on the wall, staring at the corner and covering the longest wall first. line the top of the panel", "try to encourage your loved one to be as active as possible. when she feels disturbed or has the urge to cut herself, she needs to find a more positive, active outlet to let it out. suggest doing rigorous exercise, such as running, dancing, aerobics, swimming, tennis, or kick boxing. these can provide an outlet for all of her sadness, aggression, or unhealthy emotion that leads to cutting. offer to join your friend and exercise together. to help calm the mind, she can also try yoga, meditation, or tai chi. these exercises can help her get a new lease on life, with a fresh, energetic, confident approach that will help her not want to cut herself. exercise also releases endorphins into her body, which are the chemicals in the body that makes her feel good.when a person cuts himself, endorphins rush to the area of the cut and are released into the blood stream, which cause feelings of relaxation, happiness, and relief. exercise provides her with a positive way to release endorphins instead., low self-esteem is one reason that drives a person to cut. you need to help her understand that cutting will not and cannot improve her self-image but accomplishments and achievements will. help her prove to herself that she is amazing and full of accomplishments. this can be through her studies, work, friends, or volunteering. when she becomes aware of her accomplishments, her self-esteem will go up and she will feel better about herself. this should lead her to not want to cut herself.you can help your friend realize she is full of accomplishments by sharing with her a list of her positive attributes and accomplishments. , pandering to her will not make her want to change her self-harming behavior. do not try to drill the person with lectures and sermons that go on for a long time. keep your talks small and simple. let the person take in and digest whatever it is you told her. give her the time to contemplate. have your small pep talks at a location that is pleasant, peaceful, in the midst of nature, away from hustle and bustle, and private, where the chances of being bothered are minimal. if you can't go somewhere in nature, try a quiet place in your apartment or house or a secluded study room at your local library. the exact location doesn't matter as long as it's a place where you can an honest, uninterrupted conversation. give her ample time to talk to you. give her the time she needs and wants. do not push her into speeding things up and always choose a place and time that she is comfortable with. , your loved one will not stop cutting overnight or because you tell her to. for her, this is the way she knows how to deal with her feelings. telling her to stop the behavior immediately may terrify her because she might have got so used to this coping mechanism and feel lost in the absence of an alternative coping skill. this can also make it", "noise is arguably the most important contributing factor towards annoyance.anything you say can be made annoying based on volume alone. whenever you're attempting to be annoying, make an effort to keep your speaking voice loud. try to stay clear of outright screaming, however, as it's not sustainable. to truly annoy someone, you need to keep your irritating habits up for a while. if you don't want to get in trouble, you should gauge what your parents (or other authority figures) will think of your loud volume. although you may be trying to annoy your older brother specifically, there's a good chance you may end up annoying others in the process. for a boost to your volume, try speaking directly into your brother's ear. the invasion of personal space can be a great annoyance tactic in of itself.; , if you're trying to be annoying, you should put this research to the test. if you performed well on a test at school, you should talk his ear off about it. if you like a certain trait about yourself, you should make an effort to brag about it at every twist and turn. if you brag to your parents about things you've accomplished, it might make you look better in their eyes. this technique is best used in tandem with a loud volume. unless your brother has wits of iron, this technique alone should start to show cracks in his psyche. , stress and annoyance is affected by someone's ability to cope with their current mood and workload.if your brother is carefree, it will take a lot more to annoy him than if he's already at his wit's end. try to look for signs that he's feeling stressed: he's already irritable and prone to anger. you know he's really busy with work or school. you've seen him react badly to everyday things. , question-asking is a vital part of conversation in mild doses, but if you constantly ask questions that have little relevance to the conversation at hand, it tends to get annoying fast. if you and your brother are having a conversation, you should make an effort to turn your talk into a sequence of questions about things of little value. ask him how his day was, then proceed to interrogate him about the smallest parts of his day. how was the sandwich he ate for lunch earlier that day? was the seat on the bus ride home plushy enough for his likings? these questions are usually worthless, but being bombarded by them will get the proper response out of him. if you want to get meta with your annoying questions, you might ask him \"what is it that annoys you most?\" if he's gullible enough to answer you honestly, you should put that new information to good use. , if you heard something juicy about a friend of yours, you should start rambling senselessly about it. it's fine if your brother doesn't know anything about the people you're gossiping about; to him, it'll just make your banter seem al the more pointless.", "they can be expensive, so look at thrift stores, craigslist, secondhand sports shops, or just buy a cheap stick from your local sports store.; , put the ball in the net on the end of your stick. place your dominant hand at the neck of the stick and your other hand at the bottom of the lacrosse stick. now you need to rotate your dominant hand up and down. once you have mastered this process, do so with your non-dominant hand. as you practice this, switch back and forth from hand to hand. now you can then go to a one handed

defense. , once you have the fundamentals down, you can start playing on teams. once you are on a team, you should practice your fundamentals. the team that wins is the team that can pass and catch the ball, and who can scoop a groundball. it is important to keep improving your skills. once you get to high school, try out for your school's girl's lacrosse team. the main goal is for you to make it onto the team. two important side pieces will be your grades and staying out of trouble. remember that you are always a representative of your school and community. depending on how good your high

head could create an undesirable situation when trying to properly apply a tag or button. this could result in injury to either the person or animal or both, and may also result in improper tagging of the animal. for cattle the best equipment to use is a chute with a head gate, or even a squeeze chute. place a halter, and/or nose lead or ring on the animal and tie the lead rope to the side of the head gate tight enough so that it impedes the animal to move its head as you apply the tag or button. for young calves, a head gate is not needed. simply putting the calf on its side by bending over the calf, grabbing the flank and neck and hoisting it onto its side, then pinning it with your knee on its neck is sufficient when tagging it. tagging should be left for last when you have the calf on the ground, since the applicator often will cause a calf to become a bit more vocal than you like, particularly when its momma is close at hand. ; , tags should be applied in the middle third of the ear between the upper and lower ribs. it is important, when using electronic identification (eid) or radio-frequency identification (rfid) tags or buttons, to apply the visual panel or male portion on the outside-back part of the ear and the button or tag, which is the female portion, on the inside of the ear. also make sure that the last few digits of visual panel matches with the digits on the button or tag. , use rubbing alcohol or a disinfectant solution to clean the jaw and pin portion of the applicator before and after use. you should also clean the tagging area of the animal's ear. , the visual panel stud must be inserted completely onto the applicator pin and the panel/button portion placed under the opposite clip. often a new tagger applicator will have a sticker or indentation on that tagger telling which end is which when placing the parts of the tag on. if not, the best rule of thumb to go by is that the point part goes over the pin and the tag or button on the other end. also make sure the front of the tag or pin is facing away from the male end of the stud, not towards it. thus is much easier to remember if you have bought tags that already have a bar-code and number on them. , this must be done before you tag. simply close the jaw of the applicator to the point where to the two halves just meet. the stud should be in line with the hole of the button or tag. , firmly and quickly close the applicator and release. you will hear a loud click when the stud goes completely into the hole, and upon releasing the tagger the tag or button will have stayed in place.

purchased with rp or ip, if you don't have enough of either you'll need to play continually until you have have enough ip or you will need to purchase enough rp to buy twitch. once you purchase twitch, you may also purchase skins to change the look of twitch. , twitches abilities are deadly venom, ambush, venom cask, expunge and spray and pray. a description of each is down below :deadly venom (twitches basic ability): twitch's basic attacks apply a stack of deadly venom, dealing 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 true damage per second for 6 seconds. this effect can stack up to 6 times for a minimum of 12 / 24 / 36 / 48 and maximum of 72 / 144 / 216 / 288 total true damage over the duration. ambush:for 1.25 seconds, twitch attempts to enter stealth, which may be delayed by up to 3 seconds if he takes damage before he goes invisible. while in stealth, twitch gains 20% bonus movement speed. when twitch unstealths, he gains bonus attack speed for 5 seconds. casting spells or attacking will end his stealth prematurely. venom cask: twitch hurls a cask of venom at an area, infecting struck enemies with 2 stacks of deadly venom and slowing them for 3 seconds. contaminate: twitch expunges all nearby enemies afflicted by deadly venom, dealing physical damage equal to a base amount plus bonus damage for each stack of deadly venom on an enemy. rat-ta-tat-tat: for 7 seconds, twitch gains bonus attack damage and 300 attack range. additionally, each of his basic attacks will pierce enemies in an 850 length line, with each unit struck reducing the attack's damage by 20% down to a minimum of 40% damage. , select your runes, masteries, champion skin and summoner spells. summer spells are chosen in regards to your playstyle preference, though a flash spell can be useful when getting one last hit on fleeing enemies or as an emergency escape tool. , twitch's ability to go invisible can be used when ganking (ambushing) enemies and can also be used as an escape tool. as ambush provides an additional attack speed boost once you leave invisibility, it can be useful when taking down turrets, however, being pushed far into your lane with ambush on cooldown could leave you very vulnerable if ganked by an enemy. , this can be achieved by getting continuous hits on an enemy. once you have achieved the maximum stack of passive damage dealt by deadly venom, use the venom cask to slow the enemy so that an additional chance to deal damage is made. , due to twitch having one of the highest attack speeds out of all of the champions, buy items in the shop that provide additional passive boosts upon hits that will add to the damage dealt by deadly venom. , contaminate has a high radius and will deal a significant amount of", "squats are your number one go-to exercise if you're

keep going until you have completed 10 repetitions with each leg., leg raises are performed while lying on your side. they are an effective exercise as they allow you to work your butt and lower back simultaneously. to perform leg raises correctly: lie on your right side, propping your head up with your right elbow. if desired, bend your right knee but keep your left leg straight and in line with your back. keeping your foot parallel with the ground, raise your left leg as high as you can, without moving your hips. you can use your left hand to support your hips and prevent them from tilting backwards. squeeze your butt muscles as you lift your leg and try to keep your abdominals firm. slowly lower your leg back to the starting position, then repeat eight to 10 more times before switching

that you can call yourself a relationship coach without receiving any training. this also means that there are numerous certification programs available that vary in quality.if you are serious about becoming a relationship coach, you should find a quality program that is accredited or approved through the icf or another professional organization. you do not need any prior skills, degrees, or experiences to be a relationship coach. you can decide to become a relationship coach and learn what you need through the certification program. however, you should be comfortable talking to people

by the american psychotherapy association, requires a bachelor's degree in counseling. to get a certification that is recognized by a professional counseling association, such as the apa, you will have to already be a working counselor or social worker with a degree in a counseling-related field., there are a lot of different programs you can go through to get certified. some are longer than

throughout your house or in a room designated for your cat. this will discourage the cat from coming to your room at night for snuggles or attention. lay out pillows, blankets, and nesting materials so your cat can choose what sleeping space it likes. consider putting up room-darkening curtains or blackout curtains in your cat's space. since cats are most active in early morning and at twilight, the darkness may trick your cat into sleeping longer.; , your cat may be more active in the evening if it doesn't get enough physical activity throughout the day. try to play with your cat for 5 to 10 minutes several times a day. if you see your cat sleeping for several hours during the day, wake it up and play with it for a few minutes. wearing your cat out will help it sleep better at night.try giving your cat food puzzles to play with before bedtime. this will use up some of your cat's energy and give it a last snack before bedtime which may prevent it from waking you at night for food. , if your cat is in the habit of eating its dinner in the early evening, begin shifting its dinner closer to its bedtime. this will keep your cat fuller longer so it won't wake you in the middle of the night looking for food. instead of making a sudden dinner time change, gradually shift its meal time back by half an hour at a time.you could also feed less food at dinner time and reserve the rest to give your cat as a snack before bed. , if your cat is only waking you at night so you'll feed it, you may want to just set out its breakfast before you go to bed. you could also use a timed meal dispenser if you're worried the cat will eat its breakfast too early. for example, you could set the dispenser to feed your cat every morning at the same time. this way, it learns to associate food with the dispenser and it won't wake you.if you choose to give the cat its breakfast in the morning, wait a while after you wake up. this way, the cat doesn't associate waking you up with getting its food. , if you give your cat access to your room and it continues to wake you, consider closing your door so it can't get in. you may find that closing your door isn't enough and your cat continues to scratch or paw at your door. this is why it may be important to give your cat its own sleeping space. if you choose to keep your door closed but give your cat free range of the house, be prepared to

melody instruments (guitars, bass). while there is no law saying that you can't jam with 15 other people, jam groups generally stay smaller so that every musician can listen in and play off of every other musician. a small group of 3-4 similarly skilled musicians is a good place to start. that said, there are many long-standing groups, such as blues bands, drum groups, and bluegrass bands, that have enormous, open jams, inviting a wide variety of skills and styles. jamming is non-judgmental and free-form, so just have fun. if you're just starting to improvise, jumping into a large jam session is a great way to get your feet wet without a ton of pressure, as any mistakes you make are less likely to get noticed.; , think of this as the guiding principle of the song. while there will likely be some improvisation and exploration, everyone needs to understand the chords in order to stay together. in general, most jams stick to simple, 3-4 chord songs or melodies that everyone already knows. the point of a jam is not to show off complex, interlocked instrumentals, but to allow each musician the freedom to experiment. jams can either play established songs, such as the blues jam classic \"stormy monday,\" or quickly improvised chord groupings. if you're confused, let someone pick a song and the chords and go from there. if you don't know the chords, sit back and watch another instrument or ask someone playing for advice.if you're a percussionist you should ask about the tempo, or set the tempo yourself if you know the skill levels of your fellow musicians. , in general, you play through the song \"as written\" briefly, sometimes with vocals, so that everyone gets used to the feel of the song. if you're improvising the song on the spot, this is a good way to get everyone on the same page. keep the first minute or two simple so that everyone can get used to the structure. once everyone is on the same page the fun can begin. , more often than not, one or two people will emerge as the \"leaders\" of the jam, keeping everyone on time and noting when people should take solos. as you play, keep your head up and watch the other musicians keep the band together. eye contact, brief signaling, and even talking about upcoming chords or changes will help everyone stay on the same page. as you get more comfortable with your fellow musicians, you can often hear when there is space for a solo and when the rhythm is changing, but you should still be looking up for visual cues from time to time. watch any improvisational or jam band play live -- you'll notice small moments when the musicians make eye contact through the show, usually before changes, solos, or the song's end., if everyone else starts playing fewer notes, calming", "is it

thoughts faster and to learn and explore different ideas and cultures. , read the back cover or inside front cover. both, if possible. figure out the basic plot of the story. if there isn't any information on the book covers, google it. watch out for spoilers, though! , your reading nook should be somewhere quiet where you can concentrate without distractions. try to avoid rooms where loud talking and electronic noises could mess with your ability to comprehend what you're reading. if you can't find a place in your house to read, try the library, a cafe or coffee, or better yet, the great outdoors! beaches on lazy summer days make just as great of a place to read as your own backyard does! , set aside time for reading. but make this reasonable for you. for one person it may be 15 minutes, for another an hour--there's no perfect amount. but be sure it's enough time to make it useful to forward the story, but not so long you get restless, bored, or fatigued. , if this is true of

making sounds -- you'll know it when you find it. try holding a finger in front of your mouth and singing at it; does that help? it should! another trick is to speak the words and then sing them just how you spoke them. at least as english speakers, the majority of our words are said fairly forward; mimicking that helps tell our brains what we need to do. , this, however, is one of the metaphors. it's one of those things that singers get; if you've spent a while working on your voice, you may know what this means. the best way to visualize it is seeing the notes come out of the top of your

fully. ask your child about why they are abusing steroids and where they have been gaining access to them. you should try to obtain this information to help your child, not to punish them. some things you may want to discuss include: your teen’s stress level. talk to your child about their stress levels and even their self-esteem. are they feeling pressured by others? get to the root of the problem. once you find out the reasoning, you have already achieved the first vital step. , it is common for teens to deny their steroid abuse. if this is the case and your teen absolutely refuses to talk to you, you can purchase a home drug testing kit. once the results are positive, there is no more room for discussion on the matter. at this point you will know for a fact, and will need to take the necessary steps to help them succeed in their recovery. , you need to make a plan based on your child’s specific case. what does your teen need? how will you provide it? you need to make a plan of

you use broth.red wine. dry red wine can add a nice acidic note to beef, especially when combined with another braising liquid, like stock. the alcohol cooks off, resulting in a rich and fragrant dark sauce. especially fruity or sweet red wines would be less desirable, but fine if paired with an equal amount of stock to cut the sweetness. the fruitiness of a white wine would pair better with chicken or pork. since it'll season your dish, make sure it's something you'd like to drink--pour yourself a glass for \"research.\" dark beer. english cooking at its finest. stouts, porters, or black lagers all lend a rich sweetness to beef, and a malty depth of flavor. the darker the better, when it comes to beef. some belgian ales might also work nicely, but experiment and find a beer you with a nice flavor. in general, lighter pilsners and lagers are more appropriate for chicken or pork. how much liquid you'll need will depend on the amount of meat you're braising, and the addition of extra vegetables. as a general rule of thumb, you'll want enough liquid to cover the vegetables at the bottom of the pot and come up just to the level of the meat. you're not boiling the meat, or stewing it, so you won't submerge it in the braising liquid. it won't take much, and you can always add additional water to the pot if you didn't have", "consider telling them a bit more about what you've been up to. for example: an award you recently received, a new teacher/lecturer at your school or college, a new style that everybody is wearing, which of your hobbies you like the most, and so forth.; , you don't have to be entirely familiar with your relative to be polite. just avoid topics that might be touchy, be respectful of their opinions and avoid arguing the point on anything. be considerate as well as being polite. for example, if a relative recently passed that uncle larry was close to, don't say anything that might stir up bad memories. , make a reference about the food you are eating. it's a common task that can take the conversation far. it will often draw in others too, as they won't want to appear remiss in mentioning the chef. , current events are ways to get family to talk about opinions or experiences, as well as discussing whether they're going or not. it's also a great way to find out what other events are coming up, as they'll share the things they're planning to do that haven't been mentioned yet. , this can ease a bit of tension, by allowing others to contribute to the conversation. in particular, look for the quiet ones who seem willing to say something but need prompting, out of shyness, fear or uncertainty. , this is a great conversation topic that really can get things moving. asking after what a mutual friend/neighbor or person is now doing can be a great way to connect various people and to lead into further discussions. , if people wish to talk about something that you're not that interested in, make an effort to appear interested for at least a short time. you can change the subject after it's clear that they've said their piece and feel heard, not before. , offer to hand out food when people are seated elsewhere than at the table. when at the table, pass food promptly and considerately so that everyone gets a share. it's another good excuse to talk too, as you can ask how they like the food, what their favorite foods are and whether they'd like more. , offer to do the dishes, put things away, clear up, etc. encourage others to help too. it's a good way of having a chance to natter with those who are helping with you and to get the cleaning up done quickly, so that everyone can get back to conversing together. do not leave the chef all alone in the kitchen, unless he or she prefers it that way. , if some of your family members are parents of small children, offer to play a game with the kids outside or in another room, to give the parents a break and a chance to chat with the rest of the family without constant interruptions. you'll get to spend time with the kids and you'll get lots of appreciation and respect from the parents. , if there are members of", "this project works best for pipes lying in or near a corner. it also works well for pipes running along one wall seam. you will need to box in the pipe from two sides, so there needs to be two nearby walls. even if the pipe does not lie directly in a corner or along a wall seam, it should be relatively close. , use a combination square to determine the depth, width, and length of the pipe space you'll need to hide.place the square portion of the measuring tool against one of the walls. measure out from the wall to the exterior side of the pipe to determine the necessary depth. repeat this procedure by measuring from exterior of the pipe to the other wall. this should give you the necessary width. make sure that you are measuring at the widest point of the pipe. measure the length of the pipe, as well, so you'll know how long your boxing will need to be. , cut three battens so that the length of each one matches the length of the pipe from wall to wall (or ceiling to floor).note that if one or two of the battens will be placed over a wall with skirting on either end, you will need to make these battens a little shorter than the full length one. measure the wall length again, this time working from skirt to skirt, to find the altered length. these battens will be used to support the box sides. use plywood roughly 2 inches (5 cm) wide by 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep to create each one. , screw the battens to the wall so that they surround either side of the pipe. measure out from the corner seam of the wall when placing these battens. the placement of one should match your previously measured pipe depth, and the placement of the other should match your previously measured pipe width. use screws and wall plugs that will work on the type of wall or ceiling you're dealing with. if you're fixing the battens onto masonry, you'll need to use 5.5 to 6 mm drill bits, 2 inch (5 cm) number 8 screws, and red wall plugs set to fit holes and screws of this size. space the screws apart by approximately 15.7 inches (40 cm). drill a pilot hole into the wall, hammer in the wall plug, then gently twist the screw into the plug. , measure and cut two plywood boards. these will become the sides of your pipe boxing. the length of each board needs to match the length of the pipe space and the length of the battens. the width of one board must match the distance between the wall and the outside edge of one batten. the width of the other board must match the distance between the other wall and the outside edge of the other batten. note that these distances should also match your pipe width and depth dimensions from earlier, but it can be a good idea to measure the space again before", "if you buy ingredients separately rather than in a kit, it is cheap. you can bleach your hair, then mix small amounts of the chemicals later to touch up your roots.; , you can get some hair from your hairbrush and going through the bleaching process with it to test how it will go. it's better to test it out first; that way, there won't be any surprise you'll have to grow out! , don't use styling products that may cause buildup. leaving your natural oils on your head helps to protect your scalp and hair. , the night before you intend to bleach, soak your hair in coconut oil and leave it in overnight. again, this helps protect your hair and scalp from damage. , once you begin, you must work quickly to avoid burns, so having it all there helps. , put on your goggles and gloves! add tape around them to protect your eyes. note: you should wear a button down shirt or a loose fitting top so that you can take off your shirt to rinse your hair without getting bleach all over your clothes. , liberally smear around your hairline, ears and neck with vaseline to provide a barrier between the bleach and your skin. , add 2 ounces (60 ml) of bleaching powder (or 1 scoop of clear developer and 1 scoop of bleach), in a room with windows. remember that you will get a higher lift if you use 30 or 40 volume. they also have a higher risk of burning your scalp. , then commence mixing the bleach and developer mixture. prepare to apply the mixture. , do not start at your roots, unless you want to come out with lighter roots and darker ends. you can put foil under a section of hair, paint on the bleach, then wrap up that section in foil if you like. make sure it is hairdressing foil and not tin foil from the grocery store or you could damage your hair. , keep 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) away from your roots initially. after you have finished the rest of your hair, apply the bleach mix to your roots, being careful not to massage it into your scalp too much. avoid putting the bleach directly onto your scalp. if you do, it will sting or burn a little bit, and it will hurt a bit. if it burns a lot, this is a chemical burn. rinse it out immediately. , you may wish to put more bleach, earlier, on whichever part of your hair is darker. so if your roots are dark and the rest of your hair has been bleached before, bleach the roots for 15 or 30 minutes longer than the rest of your hair. if your roots are light or blonde and the rest of your hair is darker, paint the dark bits first. , put a shower cap, aluminum foil, or clear/white plastic bag over your hair. make sure it's not covering your face, but is over all of your hair. then tie", "mice are clever creatures that aren't easily spotted during daytime hours while people are around. you might notice a slight movement out of the corner of your eye and not even realize that what you noticed was a mouse. next time you see a movement, take it as a sign that you should investigate further.; , it's easier to hear mice at night when the house or apartment is quiet. you may hear a light tapping or scratching that sounds like it's coming from the walls. if you hear sounds of mice running along the walls, that's a sign that you've got more than one creature to take care of. if you hear squeaks, you may have a mouse nest full of babies on your hands. , mouse droppings are small, dark and seed-shaped. new droppings are wet and black, and older ones will have dried out to a lighter gray color. note which room you see the droppings in. the presence of droppings in a room should indicate that something in the room is attractive to mice. the presence of droppings can also indicate that there's a crack or hole in the room through which mice can enter. , if you can determine the pathways the mice often use, you will be able to catch and track the mice more easily. mice often establish runs and use the same pathways time after time. usually the runs are not directly visible so the mouse is only visible as it traverses a few feet of open floor or counter top., of course, it will be along the runs if you have been able to identify them. and you will probably find the nest near where you saw a concentration of droppings. nests are usually built in the corners of cabinets or closets. look in out-of-the-way places that don't often get disturbed. mice chew through cardboard boxes and items of clothing to use as materials for their nests. look for tiny holes in the pile of clothes you've left sitting in the back of your closet. a musty smell might also indicate the presence of a mouse nest. , mice are lured into these traps by the scent of bait placed inside it, usually peanut butter or cheese. they enter a small hole and get trapped in with the bait. once a mouse has been caught, you can take the trap to a field or the woods and set the mouse free. make sure to always use surgical (or other) gloves when baiting or handling traps. mice have an extremely good sense of smell and will not enter a trap that has been handled by humans or that smells \"off,\" perhaps because of chemical smells or soap residue. be aware of your handling from the time you start to unwrap the trap after your purchase and strive to not touch the trap directly with your skin, ever. this will assure best chances of trapping your target(s). set live traps in the room where you found mouse droppings or a nest. live traps are more", "make sure the rack you'll be using is placed in the middle

the bread into 1\" pieces if you want a uniform, classic, make-no-mistake-about-it bread pudding. what kind of bread to use? well, that's sort of up to you. but sourdough, french, brioche, italian, or even sweet rolls will guarantee a delicious flavor. , try to get it spread as evenly as possible, because you want every bite to have a hint of buttery goodness. mix it up in the pan a bit if need be to immerse all the pieces. , if you're using raisins, of course! you can also use 1/2 cup of another dried fruit if raisins aren't your thing. but toasted nuts (pecans, anyone?) or even fresh fruit (like a chopped apple) are to die for, too. , if you're looking for a twist, the zest of a lemon or orange or 1/4 cup rum or grand marnier could do the trick. what does \"milk\" really mean? it can mean anything from soy to 2% to a mixture of milk and cream, if you're feeling extra decadent. the thicker and creamier it is, sure, the fattier it'll be, but it'll also be more scrumptious, too. , make sure it gets everywhere! mix it up a bit so all sides of the bread can sop up the flavor. , this helps the bread absorb the mixture and to coat all bread pieces. mix it up slightly to spread the mixture evenly. at this stage, you can opt to put the pudding in the fridge for up to an hour to give the flavor a chance to soak into the bread. however, if your stomach is rumbling now, it can be skipped. , you'll know it's done when you insert a toothpick into it and it comes out clean. let the bread pudding cool for 10-15 minutes. you can resist for that long, right? , you can also top with milk or cream to make it extra gooey. or keep reading for some extra delicious ideas! , we briefly mentioned this up top, but bread pudding is a great base for a number of flavors. it's sweet, but not too sweet, and rich, but not too rich. here are a few ideas to spruce up your dish: fresh fruit, like apples or berries dried fruit, like dates or figs pecans or walnuts, toasted and chopped caramel or butterscotch drizzled on top top it with sugar, brown sugar, or a streusel topping of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a bit of flour and butter , just when you thought it couldn't be any better, huh? after it comes out of the oven and while it's cooling, grab your saucepan and start making a sauce to pour over the individual servings. it's quite simple: combine 1/2 cup sugar, 1 stick butter,

rod, 15” (38.1 cm) long two eyehooks; , the plywood needs to be cut into triangles. these triangles will serve as supports to stabilize the trebuchet when it is in use. using a jigsaw or table saw (whichever is available) cut the square from corner to corner through the center.if you don’t have a table saw or jigsaw, many home improvement stores will cut wood for you before you take it home. , measure 13” (33 cm) from the left side of one of the 36” (91.4 cm) long pieces of wood and make a mark. place the 23” (58.4 cm) long piece of wood perpendicular to the 36” (91.4 cm) long piece of wood on top of the mark that you made.lay one of the triangle-shaped pieces on top of these supports so that the base of the triangle is aligned horizontally with the bottom of the 36” (91.4 cm) piece of wood and the straight side is aligned vertically with the left side of the 23” (58.4 cm) piece. hammer nails into each corner and 2-3 nails along each side of the triangle. , use the same process detailed above, but make it in a mirror image. this will ensure that when you build the base, both supports will face the same direction and the wooden triangles will face out.when both sides are constructed, line them up and make sure they are identical mirror images of each other. , stand the side supports up making sure the triangle wood pieces face out. place one 12” (30.5 cm) long piece of wood between each side of the ends of the supports. using the drill, attach the pieces together with two screws on each side.at this point, the base is almost finished. you should have a

disease (e.g., diabetes) or multiple health problems, it may take longer for your vet to examine your dog and perform testing. or, if your vet suspects a new health problem during the exam, your dog may need additional testing during the appointment. when you schedule the appointment, choose a date and time when you will not have any time constraints.; , when you call the vet’s office, ask if you will need to bring medical documents or samples (fecal, urine) with you to the appointment.if you know ahead of time what you will need to bring, you will be better prepared for the exam. , blood work is part of a dog’s annual vet exam. fasting helps ensure the test results are accurate and not affected by what your dog eats before the blood draw. also, certain blood tests, like a bile acid test, require a dog be fasted for 12 hours before the blood sample is taken. fasting can involve withholding only food or withholding both food and water. if you need to fast your dog, your vet’s office will give you specific instructions on how to perform the fast. a bile acid test is a way to detect liver problems in dogs., because annual vet exams involve the assessment of many aspects of your dog’s health, the cost of the exam could be high. when you schedule the exam, ask the receptionist for an estimate of the exam’s cost. the actual cost may be different, but knowing an approximate cost beforehand will prevent sticker shock when the exam is over. approximate costs for an annual vet exam are listed below:office visit (cost of appointment and physical exam): $45‒$55 vaccinations: about $20 each heartworm test: $45‒$50 fecal exam: $25‒$45 geriatric screening (for dogs seven years or older): $85‒$110 , for your dog’s annual vet exam, your vet will test your dog’s feces for intestinal parasites. prior to the exam, you will probably need to collect a fecal sample. this sample should be fresh—less than twelve hours old.a fresh sample will provide the most accurate results, since the eggs and larvae from some intestinal parasites can become unrecognizable in old fecal samples., although picking up dog poop is never fun, collecting a sample will help you prepare for your dog’s annual exam. pick up a sample with a doggie bag or a pooper scooper. if you use a doggie bag, turn it inside out so your hand is on the outside of the bag. pick up a sample, use your free hand to turn the bag right side out, and tie a knot at the top of the bag.doing it this way will keep your hands from getting dirty. if you use a pooper scooper, pick up the sample with the scooper and empty the sample into a plastic bag. tie a knot once the sample is in the bag. it’s okay if you pick up grass, leaves,", "eating yogurt is known to be so helpful in the prevention of yeast infections that many doctors advise their patients to stop by the grocery store after picking up their antibiotics prescription. that's because yogurt contains lactobacillus acidophilus, a bacteria that lives in the vagina and keeps the chemistry there balanced. lactobacillus acidophilus gets depleted by antibiotics, and eating yogurt restores it and helps to prevent the growth of candida albicans - yeast.when you buy your yogurt, check the label to make sure it contains lactobacillus acidophilus in the ingredients list. not all commercially-manufactured yogurt has it, but most brands do. either flavored or plain yogurt should be fine. for best results, eat one or two servings of yogurt every day when you're on antibiotics. it doesn't hurt to continue eating plenty of yogurt when you're finished taking them, either, since antibiotics are just one culprit leading to yeast infections.; , yogurt may be the most popular choice when it comes to replenishing healthy bacteria, but it's far from the only one. fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, and fermented tea, and more also contain probiotics, the living organisms our bodies need to stay healthy and balanced so that yeast doesn't grow out of control.because probiotics also help to regulate your digestive system, there are many manufacturers have added them to products in which they wouldn't naturally occur. cheese, juices, cereal and granola bars enhanced with probiotics can be found in grocery stores. take probiotics supplements as an alternative. if you're not a big fan of yogurt or sauerkraut, you can pick up a bottle of probiotics supplements instead. these contain the same healthy bacteria as yogurt, this time in the form of pills. take the recommended dosage throughout the course of your antibiotics treatment. , garlic has antifungal properties that help destroy the yeast that leads to infections. eating plenty of garlic while you're on antibiotics could help keep an infection at bay. taking garlic supplements is another way to go, and keeps you from having garlic breath for days on end.some women apply the garlic directly to the vagina when they feel the beginnings of an infection coming on. to try this, wrap a peeled clove of garlic in a small piece of cheesecloth. tie it off, leaving a tail on the end. insert it in the vagina with the tail hanging outside the vagina for easy removal. leave it in for a few hours or overnight, then discard. , goldenseal is another natural remedy that many have found helps prevent yeast infections. before taking this or any other herbal supplement, check with your doctor to make sure it's ok to take it with your other medications., avoid foods or soft drinks that are high in sugar. stick with fruit and raw honey if you need something sweet. , there is limited evidence to support the notion that alcoholic beverages, breads and other foods made with yeast can lead to yeast infections. it won't hurt to limit your intake of these, but it may not necessarily help., cotton is a", "thumb-sucking is a normal, natural behavior for many children, and is something they do to comfort themselves and alleviate anxiety. generally, it will not need correction if it does not continue past 2-4 years of age; most children will give it up before starting kindergarten. however, if you notice any of the following, it might be a problem. it's causing dental problems- thumb-sucking can sometimes affect a child's bite, the alignment of their teeth, or the way the roof of their mouth develops. it's causing social problems - children who suck their thumb may be teased, ostracized or bullied. it's causing medical problems- persistent thumbsucking can cause the skin on the thumb to shrivel, crack, or chap. it can prevent the nail from growing properly, or even cause infections under and around the nail bed.; , many children suck their thumb only at certain times, like when they are falling asleep or riding in the car. others do it for comfort when they're hurt or upset. in many cases, they might not even be aware that they are sucking their thumb. learning your child's triggers can offer clues as to the best method for helping them stop. , children often use behaviors like thumbsucking to get attention from adults; they can also become battlegrounds for power struggles between parents and children. the more you talk about or call attention to the behavior, the more your child will do it. if you suspect this is the case, try to ignore the thumbsucking for a period of time. give it about a month, and see what happens. your child may stop sucking their thumb on their own. , positive reinforcement is one of the best ways to encourage behavior change in children. give verbal praise to your child for not sucking their thumb. you could also set up a simple reward system. put a sticker on the calendar for every day your child does not suck their thumb. at the end of a week with no thumbsucking, give your child a small reward or prize - an extra bedtime story or a small toy. at the end of a month, offer a larger reward, perhaps a special outing. gradually extend the length of time required to earn rewards. , a thumb that is covered will not feel or taste the same as a bare thumb, and this is often enough to stop many children's thumbsucking. try a band aid, a finger cot, a small finger puppet, or a thumb guard. if thumbsucking occurs mainly at night, try putting a mitten or a sock over the hand. , it's hard for a child to suck their thumb if it's in use. keep your child busy with art supplies, outdoor play, blocks, puzzles, or anything that requires them to use two hands. , no matter what method you choose, it will not work if your child does not want to stop thumbsucking. you will meet with much greater success if you are working with a willing participant. talk to your child about why they need to", "it needs to be at least twice the height and width you want your final planter to be. for a large planter, try something around 24 inches (60 centimeters) long and wide.for a smaller planter, try an 8 by 12-inch (20 by 32-centimeter) rectangle instead.if you can't find any packaging paper, you can also use plain, solid-colored wrapping paper, \"kraft\" paper, or butcher paper.; , peel away a few inches of contact paper from the backing, and align it with the edge of the packaging paper. working a little bit at a time, start peeling away the backing and pressing the contact paper down onto the packaging paper.you can use clear contact paper or colored contact paper for some contrast. if you paper is very wide, you may need to add more rows of contact paper. overlap every row by about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) to prevent leaks. , you don't have to do this, but it will give the planter some texture. it will also make the paper softer and easier to work with.once the paper is textured to your liking, smooth it out on a flat surface., set the paper down, contact-side-up. orient the paper horizontally, then fold the side edges towards the middle. overlap them by about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). don't worry about creasing the edges of the paper. don't worry if your paper looks too tall at this point. the next few steps will fix that. , lift the top flap up. run some glue or double-sided tape along the edge of the bottom flap. press the top flap back down and run your finger along the seam. avoid getting any glue inside the planter. a glue stick might work best for this as it won't leak out. , how far up you fold depends on how wide you want the planter to be. the higher you fold, the wider the planter will be.plan on folding the bottom edge up at least to the halfway point., when you folded the bottom edge up, you will have ended up with a two-layer pocket. pull the two layers apart and flatten them, turning the pocket into a diamond-shape with a slit down the middle.you can gently crease the edges of the diamond, but you don't have to. , make sure that the corners overlap each other by ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters). secure them to the bottom of the bag with glue. you can also place a strip of sturdy tape (ie: packaging tape or duct tape) over the corners instead., place your hand into the planter and gently push out the bottom until it is flat. set the planter down on a flat surface. don't worry if it wobbles around too much., this will add some thickness and dimension to the top band. for a smaller planter, fold it down by only 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters). for a larger planter, try 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters). for a softer touch, roll the top down instead., you can always", "you can start thinking about a career in criminology while you are still in high school. concentrate on doing well in all academic subjects, since this will help you prepare for a criminal science program in college. good high school courses for a future criminologist to take include sociology, government, history, psychology, and statistics.some high schools offer courses in criminology, criminal justice, or related areas.if yours does, be sure to take them. in addition to academics, seek out extracurricular activities to broaden your education and deepen your interests. you could join or start a criminology club, for example, as well as participate in common activities like mock trial, debate club, math team, etc.; , some colleges and universities have degree programs in criminology, but there is no set subject your degree must be in. whatever your chosen major subject is, make sure to take courses in areas like sociology, psychology, criminal justice, statistics, writing, and computer science.criminologists enter the field from a variety of academic backgrounds, including: criminology sociology psychology criminal justice , work with your school to develop an internship plan that fits your educational and career goals. you might seek internships with:a police department a law office state or federal government offices community organizations research groups , earning a master’s degree or even a doctorate can help you gain more advanced positions, greater responsibilities, and higher pay. you can earn a graduate degree in a field such as: behavioral science criminology sociology psychology criminal justice , in other words, even if you earn your degree, you may not be able to practice as a criminologist until you pass the licensure examination. the specific format of the examination will vary depending upon your location and the agency you want to work for. expect the examination to be rigorous, however, so study hard beforehand. , there are a number of organizations serving the field of criminology, such as: the international society for criminologythe american society of criminologythe academy of criminal justice sciencesthe law and society associationthe midwestern criminal justice associationthe western society of criminology, while you may look for an entry-level position at first, there are usually good opportunities for advancement. however it may be difficult to cross fields. for instance, if you are hired with a state agency, it might be more difficult to later get an advanced job at a federal agency, and vice versa.criminologists find positions with: police departments the fbi state and local governmental agencies colleges and universities consultancy agencies , during the process of being hired for a job in criminology, you can expect to have to pass background and security checks.as participants in the fight against crime, criminologists are expected to have good records and impeccable ethics. , your day-to-day work as a criminologist will vary depending upon your specific position and area of expertise. most jobs in the field, however, eventually involve some combination of fieldwork, analysis, and reporting. for instance: you might be present at a crime scene, to help gather evidence and determine exactly what occurred. you might investigate how the crime is", "this is considered the \"traditional\" method of animation, in that each frame has the same picture but slightly altered. when the frames are played together, the images appear to move. this is the same basic technique used by traditional hand-animators, and is more time-consuming than tweening (see the next section). by default, flash will produce animations at 24 frames per second (fps). that means one second of animation will have 24 frames, but not every frame has to be different. you can adjust this if you'd like, and many flash animations use 12 fps, but 24 will produce much \"smoother\"-looking animation.; , there are a variety of flash animation programs available, but the most powerful is adobe's flash professional cc. you can install the trial for free, or you can use another product if subscribing to adobe's creative cloud doesn't appeal to you. the rest of this article will refer to flash professional or any other editing program as \"flash\". , because frame-by-frame animation requires multiple images with slight differences, you will need to create all of these assets by hand. you can create them all before you begin, or make them as you go. you can use the flash program to draw directly in your project, or you can draw your assets in your favorite image creation program. if you want your images to scale without sacrificing quality, you will want to create them as vectors instead of rasters. vector images will redraw themselves whenever they are scaled, which means there won't be any pixelation or aliasing. raster images are the traditional images you're probably used to (photos, paint images, etc.). these do not scale well, and can look quite ugly if you want to make them larger. , when you first start flash, you will have a blank layer and an empty timeline. as you add frames, your timeline will be populated automatically. you can interact with layers much in the same way that you would in photoshop. before adding your image, create a basic background for your movie. rename layer 1 to \"background\" and then lock the layer. create a second layer and name it whatever you'd like. this will be the layer that you create your animation on. add your drawing to the canvas in the first frame. you can either import your drawing from your computer, or you can use flash's drawing tools to create a drawing directly in the program. your first frame will be a keyframe. keyframes are frames that have an image, and form the backbone of your animation. you will be creating a new keyframe each time the picture changes. keyframes are denoted by a black dot in the timeline. you don't need a new image in each frame. in general having a keyframe every four-five frames will produce a good animation. , by turning your drawing into a symbol, you can easily add it multiple times in a frame. this is especially useful if you need to quickly create multiple objects, such as a school of fish. select your entire drawing. right-click", "your school may or may not have a supply list; if it doesn't, then the teachers will give you one in the first week of school. you should wait until open house or the first week of school for any less commonplace supplies, but there are some basic supplies you are likely to need regardless of your particular classes: pencils eraser sharpener pens ruler scissors glue sticks (liquid glue is not very efficient in class) colored pencils; , ensure that it sits comfortably and is not harming your posture. your backpack should not weigh more than you! , when you change classes, be organized by ensuring that everything you need is in your backpack or locker. , so if your first lesson starts at 8:30, the best time to wake up would be an hour to two hours before, in this case between 6:30 and 7:30. , have a shower every morning. uncounted people have failed to survive school because they didn't shower. if you don't have the opportunity to shower in the morning, shower the night before. even if you don't sweat a lot, it is more hygienic to shower every day/night. , breakfast is the most important meal of the day. if you don't have breakfast, you can't concentrate throughout the school day! some schools also offer breakfasts in the cafeteria. , if your school is free wear (no uniform) it is best that girls go to school in shorts and pants. many of difficult situation can be more easily survived in shorts rather than a skirt. however, if you want to wear skirts or dresses, wear leggings or tights underneath. even if you do have a uniform you can still look yourself. add some jewelry or change up your shoes and you will look like yourself and still follow the school's rules., just dress appropriately. you don't want to remember wearing short shorts and spaghetti straps in middle school when you are older. look your best on picture day. that means that if you school is free wear, don't come in something too sparkly and don't wear a lot of makeup; the light will make you look like the mad hatter! , even though your teacher may give a lot of homework, just make sure to think positive. school isn't about making you stressed out, it's about teaching you to become a successful adult. talk to your parents if you feel like you've been stretched to your wits end because of all the work you're getting though. that's not good! , pay attention in class. the next thing you know after not paying attention is that your teacher asks you what she or he just said and you have no idea. if you need to, take notes so that you can look back on them for reference. if you have trouble understanding the homework material then don't be afraid to ask your teacher. study hard for the exams. the exams in the fifth grade are nothing compared to the exams in the sixth grade. remember that school comes before", "cash is the most widely accepted form of payment for a money order. you can go to any money order provider and purchase a money order with cash. you simply pay for the amount of the money order plus a fee.companies that issue money orders want the most secure form of payment possible because once they issue the money order, their money is as good as gone. you can also pay with a debit card linked to your bank account. you cannot pay for a money order with a personal check. checks can take a few days to process. if you don’t have sufficient funds, the money order issuer loses the money.; , the only place you can purchase a money order with a traveler’s check is at the united states post office (usps). you will have to pay for the amount of the money order plus a fee based on the money order amount. when you pay, sign the traveler’s check in front of the postal service worker who is preparing the money order for you.usps is willing to accept traveler’s checks because they recognize them as a form of cash., some money order issuers allow you to use a credit card, but not all. you can use a credit card to purchase a money order at western union and 7-eleven. it is expensive to buy a money order with a credit card. your card issuer will likely view it like a cash advance. this means they will charge you the higher interest rates and fees associated with cash advances. also, you don’t earn any points or rewards on cash advances, so you won’t earn them for purchasing a money order either., you can pay with one of these cards at western union, walmart, the post office and 7-eleven. however, doing so is often linked with suspicious activity. for example, some people purchase these pre-paid cards and then immediately liquidate them in order to take advantage of any available rewards the cards offer. then they deposit the money orders into their bank accounts and use the money to pay their bills. but depositing lots of money orders into your bank account looks like money laundering, and your bank can close your account for doing so., some companies now allow you to purchase and send a money order online. for example, you can purchase a money order online with payko and pay with your paypal account, which is linked to a credit card or bank account. however, you can only purchase a single, $200 money order per day. this method is not as fast as other online bank transfers. instead of an instantaneous transfer of funds from one account to another, a physical money order is printed out and mailed to the recipient. this can take several days.sending money over the phone is possible, but this is not the same thing as a money order. you can contact a remittance service like western union and request an electronic transfer of funds over the phone. you can pay with a credit or debit", "unlike your trusty pair of jeans, a suit can’t be worn daily for months on end. a suit’s fibers need recovery time after each wear, otherwise you’re taking years out of its life.additionally, not wearing your suit daily keeps it clean longer, allowing for more time between visits to the dry-cleaner. if your job requires wearing suits daily, consider the following options: investing in an additional suit. not only will this extend each suit’s lifetime, but it will provide you with additional style options. should the above not fit within your budget, you can get away with buying a second pair of pants. they usually wear out faster, and having a pair of pants in a different color can give a suit jacket more versatility and style.; , filling your pockets to the brim will counter your suit’s flattering cut. bulges and lumps change its overall shape and can stretch out the fabric, leaving it shapeless and deformed.make it a point to empty your pockets before heading out in your suit, keeping only the essentials with you. , travelling with a suit takes some pre-planning, which is particularly important if you’re travelling for a meeting or conference. the last thing you want is to show up in a wrinkled suit. ideally, you should carry your suit in its garment bag rather than stuffing it in a bag or suitcase. however, it is possible to fold a suit for storage in a carry-on: hold the suit jacket upright, pop in one shoulder and pull it inside-out. tuck the other shoulder into the inside-out shoulder, folding the jacket until the lapels line up. finally, fold the jacket in half until the top of the shoulders lines up with the bottom of the jacket., this is typically sufficient to keep it clean between trips to the dry cleaner. brushes aren’t typically much more expensive than $20, and will rid your suit of hairs, dandruff and dirt that it might collect over the course of a day. just remember to always brush downwards, following the fiber (never across)., it’s entirely possible for your suit to become noticeably stained, though you shouldn’t necessarily rush to the dry cleaner when this happens. many of these stains can be spot cleaned using non-scented baby wipes.alternatively, a towel and a bit of water can be used for cleaning tougher stains. , unfortunately, your suit will get wrinkled after wearing it, and unlike the rest of your wardrobe, ironing will do more harm than good. a hot iron can damage a suit’s fibers, shortening its lifespan and causing it to lose its shape. instead of ironing, consider the following options: you can use a steamer to straighten wrinkles and rid your suit of unpleasant odours between trips to the dry cleaner. good steamers typically cost around $150 but significantly extend your suit’s lifetime.a neat trick to replicate this without a steamer (eg. while travelling), is to hang your suit in the bathroom and run a hot shower for about half an hour. this will create a similar effect as the steam", "most codes using a relatively simple substitution method are most easily cracked by doing a simple plug-and-chug, figuring out the letters one by one and patiently figuring out the code based on guesses. single-letter words in english will be \"i\" or \"a,\" so you should try to plug one in, looking for patterns, and--essentially--playing hangman. if you've got \"a - -\" solved, you know it would most regularly be \"are\" or \"and.\" guess and check. if it doesn't work, go back and try the other options. be patient and go slowly. don't worry as much about \"cracking\" the code as learning to read it. looking for patterns and recognizing the rules in which english (or whatever language is being coded) is written will get you solving the code with some time and effort.; , the most common letter used in english is the letter \"e,\" followed by \"t\" and \"a\". as you're working, use your familiarity with common words and sentence structure to start making logical guesses. you'll rarely feel sure, but the code-breaking game is played by making logical choices and going back and correcting your mistakes. watch for double symbols and short words and start solving those first. it's easier to try to make an educated guess at \"an\" or \"in\" or \"at\" than \"highway.\" , if the message includes punctuation, you're in luck. this offers a whole host of other hints that you can learn to recognize. apostrophes will almost always be followed by s, t, d, m, ll, or re,ar,bt. so, if you've got two identical symbols after an apostrophe, you've solved for \"l\" or \"d\"., if, as you solve, you think you recognize one of the common code types from the above, you've cracked it and can stop your plugging-and-chugging and fill in the message based on your code. this probably won't happen often, but the more familiar you become with common codes the more likely it will be that you'll recognize the sort of code used and will be able to solve it. number-substitutions and keyboard codes are especially common among basic everyday secret messages. keep an eye out for those in particular and apply as you see fit. , basically, a substitution cipher involves substituting one letter for another letter, according to some predetermined rule. this rule is the code, and learning and applying the rule is the way to \"break\" the code and read the message. even if the code contains numbers, the cyrillic alphabet, nonsense symbols, or hieroglyphics, as long as the type of symbol used is consistent, you're probably working with a substitution cipher, which means you need to learn the alphabet used and the rule applied to decipher the code. , the earliest sort of cipher was used by the greeks, and involved creating a grid of letters that corresponded to numbers, then using the numbers to create messages. it's a simple code to use, making it one of the foundations of modern code-cracking. if you've got a message that includes a long string of numbers, it might have been coded", "anyone who's ever been inspired to down as many franks as possible by the nathan's hot dog competition has come up against a quick and harsh reality: you can't eat that many hot dogs without preparation. the stomach is a muscle like any other. it needs training and recovery, otherwise you risk injury. if you want to increase your stomach's capacity, take it slow. according to some studies, the average human stomach holds about 1.5 liters before becoming nauseated, but can hold between 3-5 liters if trained properly. it is possible to rupture your stomach if you eat too much too quickly, but it's extremely uncommon and rare. you'll usually vomit before you risk a stomach tear or other physical problems., the healthiest way of training and expanding your stomach capacity is not with food, but with water. competitive eaters are able to drink as much as a gallon of water at a time, in less than 20 minutes. this increases the stomach's capacity and carries relatively little health impact, compared with eating lots of food at once. start slow, increasing the number of glasses of water you drink in a day incrementally, then increasing the speed at which you consume the water you drink. it's usually recommended to drink as many as eight glasses of water in a day to begin with, so start there and gradually build up your capacity. , water serves a purpose during eating competitions, as well as during your training. while dunking a hot dog bun in water might not seem that appetizing, it helps to break down the food before you put it into your mouth, making it much easier to swallow and start digesting. the faster you get it down, the more you'll be able to eat, and water helps this process. don't drink too much of the water while you're eating. while it's ok to use some water to help lubricate the food, don't gulp it to quench your thirst, or you'll be taking up valuable real estate in your stomach. , two or three times a week, competitive eater yasir salem steams as many as eight pounds of broccoli and cauliflower for a training meal. these vegetables are bland, high in vitamins, and will move through your digestive tract quickly, making them ideal for stretching your stomach easily, combined with a large amount of water.for an added bonus, add a large amount of sauerkraut. fermented cabbage has probiotic properties that will help keep your intestinal flora in balance, making it an ideal food for competitive eaters. , competitive eaters will regularly chew up to six pieces of gum at once, to strengthen jaw muscles and make sure their eating instrument is in good working order. as important as your stomach is to your ability to eat more food, it won't do any good if you can't chew that food quickly and efficiently. check out this wikihow article for neck and jaw strengthening exercises you can incorporate into your routine. , ever notice how competitive eaters are generally lean and mean? that's because", "miniature pinschers may look physically delicate but they are mentally tough and determined. this is because they were originally bred to be working dogs tasked with the job of hunting and catching vermin, such as rats. consider this side of their character if you have other pets, because the min pin will believe small mammals such as pet rabbits, guinea pigs, hamster or mice are actually prey that need to be hunted down.; , this will shape how you train it. because the miniature pinscher is a working dog it will think for itself and make its own decisions. this can lead to problems when training the dog, unless you are either totally clear and focussed about how to train or are an experienced dog handler. if you are a first time dog owner who wants an easy pet that you can cuddle but not invest a lot of time into training, then a min pin isn't the best dog for you. , most miniature pinschers have a natural guarding instinct that can make them wary of strangers. this can lead to possible behavioral issues, such as guarding the door or being territorial to visitors. a miniature pinscher's prowess and bravery in the face of vermin also translates into this attitude to strangers. this means that if the dog feels insecure it is more likely to express that as aggression than as hiding or running away., it is also in the miniature pinscher nature to want to run free and explore. because of this they are consummate escape artists. the min pin is adept at dodging between your legs when you answer the door and escaping outside, so you need to be prepared for this. if you have a yard then you need to make sure it is utterly escape proof, as a min pin will seek out the smallest gap or loose fence panel and run away., miniature pinschers are not an ideal dog if you have very young children. this is because the dog has relatively delicate legs and if rough-housed by a boisterous child, it could result in physical harm to the dog. another factor is the min pin's tendency to displays of aggression should it feel threatened. young children do not always recognize the subtle early warning signs of discomfort that dogs give off. if the child ignores the signs and approaches a fearfully aroused dog, the dog is then more likely to attack. , because of the miniature pinscher's suspicion of strangers, it is essential for the dog to be well-socialized as a puppy with all manner of people, dogs, and experiences. if you are getting the dog from a breeder, make sure the breeder has regularly exposed the dog to men, women, and children, and a wide variety of sights, sounds, and smells.it is also best to choose a puppy that has been raised inside the home, rather than outside in a kennel. this will assure that the pup is confident about the noises associated with a house, such as the vacuum cleaner, washing machines, tv,", "the process

antiques. use dish soap intended for hand washing dishes. soap that you would use in a dishwasher is more acidic.if dish soap is not successfully removing grime, it's okay to opt for a slightly stronger cleaner. something like murphy's oil would work, but use only a small amount. you should not use an abundance of oily products on older furniture.some experts feel furniture paste wax, which you can find at most hardware stores or department stores, is a better option for cleaning antiques than oil.; , to start, wet a rag with a light amount of your chosen cleaner. gently rub down the surface of the furniture. keep wiping the surface with the same rag until the rag no longer picks up new dirt or debris.avoid scrubbing, as this can damage the finish of old furniture. use gentle wiping motions instead.move the rag in the direction of the grain of the wood. , some areas may have stuck on stains or grime. you can use steel wool to remove these stains as long as you use #0000 wool and work at the stains using gentle motions.rub in the direction of the wood grain. keep rubbing until the unwanted dirt and debris is gone. make sure not to use too much force. this can damage the finish. , some areas in the furniture, like corners or curves, may be hard to reach with a rag. for these areas, use a toothbrush. dip a toothbrush in your cleaning solution. following the grain, scrub down hard-to-reach areas until dirt and grime is gone., once you're finished cleaning, you can wipe down the furniture with a dry rag. use gentle motions to sop up most of the liquid until the furniture is relatively dry to the touch. allow the furniture to air dry a bit before continuing with the cleaning process., once the furniture is dry, add a layer of polish. this will make the finish glow and give the furniture a nice look. to polish, simply take a clean cloth and buff the furniture until it glows.furniture polishes, especially silicone-based polishes, are best avoided on antiques., to prevent the buildup of grime, dust your furniture regularly. when doing routine dusting in your home, take a rag and dust off any debris built up on antique furniture. if you're using dusting sprays, go for a mild spray or no spray at all on antiques. , uv light is very damaging to antiques. therefore, it's a bad idea to allow your antiques to be exposed to sunlight.do not leave antiques outside, especially in shaded areas. do not store antiques near a window, where they may be exposed to sunlight from outdoors. , antique furniture is affected by moisture in the air. changes

only experiencing mild nausea, there are some steps you can take to reduce or prevent the need to vomit. try the following options to manage your nausea:step outside and get some fresh air take deep, slow breaths through your mouthsuck on a mint candy or chew gum smell the inside of your wrist or armpit (the smell of perfume or deodorant may distract your body from the sensation of nausea) sniff something scented, like essential oil pinch your arm or tug on your hair (physical sensations can sometimes distract the body) , if at all possible, try to anticipate when and where you will vomit if the need arises. the most ideal place is in a rest room (in the toilet, if possible), but obviously that may not always be feasible to get to a rest room. if you cannot get to a restroom, try to at least find a plastic bag or trash can to vomit into, as this will greatly reduce how much of a mess you make.if you're going to induce vomiting, wait until you can get to a toilet, trash can, or plastic bag. if you believe that you may vomit uncontrollably in the near future, stay close to a bathroom or keep a trash can/plastic bag on hand. , once you've eliminated the potential for making a mess of your immediate environment, your next focus should be on keeping yourself clean. whether you've made it to a bathroom, found a trash can, or stepped outside to a safe outdoor environment, you'll want to prepare yourself as best you can for what's about to happen. if you have long hair, tie it back, tuck it behind your ears, or hold it in place behind your head. vomit in your hair will quickly ruin your night and make an absolute mess.remove any long, dangling necklaces, or at least tuck them into your shirt. this could create a similar complication as long hair. try to direct the stream of vomit away from your shoes, pants, and hands (if you're on all fours). aim slightly ahead of where you're standing/sitting/crawling. if indoors, keep your head above the toilet or trash can. try to lower your head enough that no vomit will splatter outside the container you're vomiting into. if you're sick in bed, keep a trash can and a stack of towels next to the bed. that way, if you can't reach the trash can or make it to the toilet, you can put down a towel to vomit onto/into. the towel can easily be washed, and it will be much", "before booking your travel homestay, you will want to have a good idea of who your hosts are and precisely who will be living in the house or on the property with you. email your hosts or message them through your booking agent and ask: who are the people who live in the house? how old are they? what languages do they speak? will there be other boarders in the house or on the property? who, exactly, will be there during my stay? , the last thing you want to encounter on your excursion are accommodations that are not what you expected. before you book your travel homestay, email your host or send them a secure message through your booking agency or site. questions you should ask include: what type of shower is in the home? does the shower have hot water? where is the toilet located? what type of heat does the home have? does the home have air conditioning? does the home have fans? are there animals on the property? , before you solidify your travel plans, you will want to ask important questions about where you will be sleeping. getting a better picture of sleeping arrangements can help you decide if a particular homestay is a good fit for you. if possible, request your hosts send you photographs. email your hosts and ask: what type of room will i be sleeping in? will i be sharing the room or will it be private? whom will i be sharing a room with? what type of bed will i be sleeping on? do i need to bring my own bedding? is there a secure place in the room for my belongings? , before you decide on a travel homestay, take the time to ask your hosts important questions about the meals you will be eating while staying with them. this is especially important if you have special needs, such as food allergies or dietary restrictions. email your host family and ask: are meals included in the homestay? can specific dietary needs be accommodated? , while you are residing at your travel homestay, it is important to identify ahead of time what your access to communication via phone and/or the internet will be. do not assume that there will be wi-fi on site simply because your host is using the internet to book your homestay. contact your host and ask: is there internet access in the home? will i have access to a phone in the home? if i won’t have access to phone or internet in the home, where is the nearest place i can access each and how would i get there from the home? , it’s important to know how close your potential travel homestay is to transportation. contact your host and ask specific questions about where the homestay is located in relation to bus, train, and air transport. questions to ask include: how close in the nearest bus stop? how far away from the home is the airport? do taxis come near the residence? how long does it", "as an employee, you don't have the same sort of power that your bosses do when it comes to making big, structural changes to your company in an effort to stop workplace theft. however, this doesn't mean you can't be an immense help. if you see, hear, or otherwise observe anything that makes you think theft is taking place, talk to a supervisor immediately. don't stay silent — keep in mind, according to many workplace's rules, allowing another employee to steal can mean implicating yourself in the crime. at many workplaces, especially ones where there is a major gulf between low-level employees and the management staff or where the employees are unhappy with their jobs, there may be a \"culture of silence\" surrounding the act of workplace theft — that is, thieving employees expect others to cover for them and may use bullying or shunning to punish employees who speak out. in this case, don't ruin your relationship with your fellow employees by going directly to a boss while you're at work. instead, contact your boss via email, over the phone, or with one of the anonymous methods below. , unfortunately, at some workplaces, it may be ill-advised to earn yourself a reputation as the sort of person who reports workplace theft. in this case, try to report the theft anonymously. this way, the management can deal with the theft, but other employees won't be able to trace your actions back to you. options you may want to consider include: slipping an anonymous note under your boss's door writing information on an anonymous feedback card sending your boss an email from a \"throwaway\" email account (one that you make and use only once) meeting your boss outside of work to discuss the problem , if you see an opportunity to document an act of workplace theft with your own notes, pictures, or video footage, you may do so, but be careful. if the employee committing the theft notices you documenting him, he'll probably stop immediately and won't act out around you again, potentially making it harder for you to prove that he's stolen in the long run. in a worst-case scenario, you may even find yourself labeled a \"snitch\" and have your relationship with the other employees damaged. note that, often, it's enough to make a mental note of when and where the theft occurred and who was involved. if your boss considers you to be trustworthy and your information matches discrepancies in your employer's records, your boss may have enough information to act on even without pictures, videos, or other extra evidence. , employees have a duty to talk to their employers if and when they have information relating to workplace theft. however, they should not accuse other employees of theft when there isn't any sort of conclusive evidence to support their claims. in addition, even if there is evidence that an employee has been stealing, they should not attempt to humiliate the thief in front of other employees or customers. not only can these sorts of unsupported accusations be very", "compared to other computer programs, cleverbot is an exceptionally skilled conversationalist. however, cleverbot knows nothing of the joys of music. if you try typing in a few lines of your favorite song lyrics, most of the time, cleverbot will interpret the lyrics literally or give a nonsensical response, even if the lyrics are well-known. note, however, that for certain songs that are very well-known, cleverbot actually can (and will) recite the song lyrics if you start typing them in. for instance, try typing in the opening lyrics to queen's \"bohemian rhapsody\": \"is this the real life? is this just fantasy?\"; , a paradox is a statement, question, or idea that has an answer that can't be logically found. since some of history's greatest thinkers have struggled to untangle logical paradoxes, it's a very safe bet that cleverbot will be completely perplexed by most of them. in addition, cleverbot doesn't even do well talking about subjects that have the potential to be paradoxical, like time travel. try using some of the paradoxes below, or use a search engine to find your own — there are literally hundreds out there.“if this statement is true, then santa claus is real.” \"since we haven't been visited by people from the future, does that mean that time travel will never be possible?\" \"what would happen if pinocchio were to say, \"my nose will grow right now?\", cleverbot isn't terribly playful. for instance, if you ask it to join you in a game of chess or checkers, it'll say \"ok\", but then if you say, \"you go first,\" you'll get a nonsensical response. this is probably due to the fact that cleverbot doesn't really have the capacity to play games — it knows to say that it wants to play chess with you, but it has no idea how to actually play chess. cleverbot can, however, play rock paper scissors. try it — say \"let's play rock paper scissors\" and then say either \"rock\", \"paper\", or \"scissors\". , sooner or later, almost everyone casually messing around with cleverbot will get the idea to jokingly express the love or attraction they feel towards it. though cleverbot can handle basic overtures of love like \"i love you\" and \"marry me\", it's not so good at interpreting subtle romantic comments or come-ons. for people nursing a crush on cleverbot, a direct approach is apparently best. give it a shot — try feeding cleverbot pickup lines like \"i don't have a library card, but do you mind if i check you out?\" the response you get will usually be a little confused (at best) (if you use the library card line, you'll get \"i can say anything.\") , you might think that, because it's a computer program, cleverbot would be able to do math problems almost instantly. in fact, for some reason, cleverbot is terrible at doing math, even when the problems you ask it are very simple. it shouldn't take you long to get a confused response out of cleverbot with this strategy. sometimes, you'll even get different responses if you", "the one built in this project is 11 inches wide, 9 inches tall (excluding the top) and 16 inches long (28 x 23 x 41 cm). , here, we used 1 x 10 (19 mm × 235 mm) scrap maple lumber which had been stained and lacquered, then thrown in a construction site dumpster. for the size in the illustrations, an eight foot (2.4 m) long board and some odd scraps were used., two saw horses and a sheet of plywood works fine, but a heavy workbench would be better., there are some rabbetsto cut for joining the corners, and a sharp blade will make this process much easier., here, the end pieces are cut 8 3/8 inches (21.3 cm), to the short point, with each end cut on a 7 degree angle so the sides of the chest will be slanted. mark each cut on one piece of lumber, then cut them carefully. use the first piece as a pattern to cut the second, or measure and mark it exactly, if you prefer., make sure one end of the board is square, then measure 16 inches (40.6 cm). make your mark, then scribe a straight line across the board using a framing square. cut these carefully, as well., you can use the end boards to scribe the cuts as shown in the photo, or measure 3/4 of an inch (1.9 cm) and square this line. cut 2/3 of the thickness of the lumber deep. here, we are using a nominal one by board, 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) thick, so we set the saw to cut 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep.,, we used a carpenter's grade hot melt wood glue, but these joints may be nailed or screwed, or fastened with conventional wood glue. make sure all edges are flush and true, and try to keep the corners as square as possible. a jig will help if you are having difficulty aligning and squaring the pieces., using the dimensions of the chest shown, the bottom will be 14 1/2 inches (36.8 cm) by 7 inches (17.8 cm), but checking the actual assembled size will provide a better fit. cut the bottom out of a piece of your lumber, the size you have measured, with the saw blade set on a 7 degree bevel on the long sides so it fits the tapered sides of your chest., if it is cut correctly, you may need to tap it into place, since the tapered edges will seat firmly into the bottom., cut 3/8 inch deep around the top of the box, 3/8 inch from the outside edge. this will form a recess for the lid to set down on, creating a somewhat better seat for the lid to set in, if you are using wide lumber, as in the photos, you can rip it in half to reduce waste. mark a radius from the edge to form the curved shape of the top of the chest. here, we used the lid from a five gallon bucket, which provided an ideal curve with little effort.,", "there are plenty of options available for you to choose from, including: composition journal artist sketchpad or drawing book scrapbook with blank pages plain academic journal diary choose

(some believe this is where the name sweet itch is derived). these foods should be strictly avoided in your horse’s diet., in order for your horse’s lesions to heal, you must attempt to quell the itch. apply aloe, lavender oil, or wild germanium oil directly to your horse’s skin, or dilute essential oils in a carrier oil (such as coconut oil).avoid applying essential oil to broken skin. , you might also be able to help prevent sweet itch by feeding your horse certain foods. the idea is to change the smell of the horse’s sweat so that midges aren’t attracted – and won’t bite.you might try mixing adding apple cider vinegar to the horse’s feed, for instance. also try feeding the horse two tablespoons of garlic powder twice a day. , anti-histamines created for humans have been shown to reduce symptoms of sweet itch in horses. however, this can be cost-prohibitive due to the large doses needed for a horse.discuss this option with your veterinarian to determine the proper dose for

quit using drugs until he is ready to do so. the decision has to be yours. a great way to help you get clear on all of the advantages of living a drug-free life is to make a list of the benefits of sobriety. here are some things that you may want to consider: meth use often impacts your quality of life. your finances take a hit and relationships may be destroyed because of the erratic behavior that addiction creates. also, you always run the risk of being arrested when you use illegal drugs. these are all things that could change when you stop using meth. prolonged use of meth can cause negative health consequences such as extreme weight loss, severe dental problems including tooth loss, and skin sores that result from excessive scratching. meth use can also increase the risk of contracting infectious diseases such as hiv and hepatitis.being healthy for you and your family is often a pretty good reason to quit.; , be intentional about removing the people who introduced you to the drugs from your life altogether.this includes old friends that you have gotten high with in the past as well as your drug supplier. you should remove any avenue that you could potentially use to contact them. this includes phone numbers that are stored in your cell phone, phone numbers that may be written down on pieces of paper in your wallet or in your home, and even social media contacts. this way you will no longer have access to people who have a negative influence on you. if negative influences are still contacting you, then you may want to consider changing your phone number and deleting your social media accounts for a while. it is just as important to avoid going into old environments that may trigger your desire to use meth. many people even take alternate routes to work to avoid driving past old acquaintances. , staying busy can also help you avoid negative influences. try getting a job and even a second one if possible. experiment with working longer hours or get started with a new hobby. try to keep yourself busy so that you’re less likely to be distracted by negative people and places. , it is really important to have a strong support system as you move through the process of quitting meth. there should be at least one person who you can call at any time to help you get through a tough moment. keep your sobriety partner’s phone number in your wallet, in your cell phone, or in any place where you will have easy access to it at all times. identifying one person to be your sobriety partner is fantastic but having several people that you can call at a moment’s notice is ideal. keep in mind that the larger your support network is, the more successful you’ll be with quitting. , you may want to involve a family member or friend in this process so that

and external nasal areas will help figure out if you have an ingrown nose hair. an ingrown nose hair may present itself as an inflamed area with or without pain, and there may be a tiny, pimple-like bump where you removed the hair and it is trying to grow back.you may see these symptoms either on the outside or inside of your nose.make sure to not stick your fingers or any other objects deep inside your nasal cavity. instruments can lodge themselves in your nose, causing severe harm to you. if you can’t locate the source of the pain or your ingrown hair, either leave it alone or see a doctor.; , most ingrown hairs will heal on their own.leaving the ingrown hair in your nose will keep it from getting further inflamed as well as eventually healing it.if an ingrown nose hair is

and reduce the pain.try this treatment before you opt for a more invasive option such as releasing the hair. heat two glasses of water to a comfortable, hot temperature that won’t burn your skin. dip a soft cloth or cotton swab in the water and put it on the affected part of your nose. when the cloth or swab cools, repeat the process once more. do this procedure two to three times per day.you may gently insert the warm cloth or swab inside your nose if the ingrown hair isn’t deep within your nasal cavity.press the cloth or swab gently against the ingrown hair for a few minutes.gentle, circular rubbing the inside or outside area of your nose affected by the ingrown hair may help release it. it’s not unusual to see a small amount of pus or blood if you do this., if you feel comfortable and the ingrown nose hair is really bothering you, use a sterile needle to release the tip of the hair. this will help you remove it and any debris such as dead skin that may be inside of it.if you can see the hair, then it’s safe to release it. after you’ve washed the area, insert a sterilized needles under the hair loop or loops and gently lift the ingrown hair tips either with your fingers or tweezers.make sure that if you use a sterilized needle to release the hair that your skin is warm and moist. this will soften your skin and make it easier to remove the hair. , applying an antibiotic

certain vitamins that lead directly to improving the health of your hair. research products specifically for your hair type to find what will work best for you.most of these vitamins can be incorporated into your eating routine naturally, if they aren't included in it already. biotin, otherwise known as vitamin h, improves the health of your hair. it increases your hair's elasticity and moisturizes dryness. this will prevent breaking. you can find biotin in brown rice, lentils, oats, among other foods. vitamin a helps produce healthy sebum, an oily substance released by your scalp. sebum helps prevent dryness. do not overload on vitamin a, however, as an excess of it can actually lead to hair loss. vitamin e promotes healthy skin while improving your body's blood circulation. this vitamin increases your body's ability to intake oxygen. having a steady flow of oxygen into your body will aid your body in producing new hair cells. , in addition to strengthening your hair, more protein in your diet will improve your inner health. when your body digests protein, it breaks it down into smaller amino acids.these will aid in the construction of new body tissues, antibodies, hormones, enzymes, and blood cells. meats like steak, chicken, and fish contain healthy protein and amino acids. if you're a vegetarian, you can get your protein from tofu, beans, nuts, and legumes. these foods also replenish other vitamins crucial to healthy hair growth. protein is necessary for tissue repair. your cells need amino acids to remain intact and healthy. protein is the active substance in repairing broken cells, so having it in your diet will help replenish dead skin and hair cells. , while they're tough to come by, omega-3 fatty acids are vital to improving your inner health. good fatty acids in your diet will lower triglyceride levels, reducing your risk for heart disease.researchers have found that high levels of omega-3 acids may also lead to lower levels of depression. fish oil may even boost the effectiveness of certain anti-depression medication. while you can get omega-3 acids from supplements, you should incorporate them into your diet. many types of fish, including salmon, herring, and mackerel, contain high levels of healthy fatty acid. for vegetarians, get your omega-3 acids from walnuts and flaxseed. canola and soybean oils also contain these acids. , because so much of our body is made of water, the amount that you drink reflects in your healthy skin and hair.you want to make sure that you're properly purifying your water, so you aren't

outrage at your decision, but stay calm and firm, and keep on point. don't allow yourself to be pulled into an argument or shouting match about who was more at fault, or who is the worse person here. give reasons for the breakup only if you need to (s/he asks you why you are leaving) - s/he may already have suspected you weren't happy and that a breakup was coming, so s/he may not want to hear any more about it. when giving reasons for the breakup, don't launch into a laundry list. choose the one or two most inarguable causes, and let that be enough. you want to help him or her to understand what went wrong, especially if some behavior on his or her part was the deal breaker. but you don't want to just beat him/her down into the ground with a long recitation of his/her faults. try something like: \"it just comes down to basic incompatibility, clark. i'm more open, and you're more secretive - it's almost like you're hiding something from me, and it drives me crazy. i", "based on choice, rather than assignment, a charter school is a publicly funded independent school, which is established by teachers, parents, or community groups under the terms of a charter with either a local or national authority. schools are usually run by independent boards elected by the families of that school, and it's often required that board members have students of their own in the school. in exchange for its independence, a charter school is subject to performance reviews and may close for failing to meet agreed-upon outcomes. charter schools can be small, independent operations or can be part of a larger education company. these schools operate under the charter innovations, which include allocation of resources, new approaches to administration and governance, extended learning time, and educator evaluation. students attend charter schools as a choice made by parents or guardians, rather than a school district. because of the opt-in nature of these schools, there is often greater parental involvement.; , 6,723 charter schools currently exist in the united states, and these schools make up 6% of total public enrollment. an estimated 2.9 million children attend approximately 6,700 charter schools across the country in a variety of many settings --- rural, urban, and suburban. as of the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year, charter school students made up 6% of u.s. k-12 students in 42 states. , charter schools are the fastest-growing school option in the united states public education system. over recent years, the number of charter schools has grown by six percent, nearing 7,000 as of the end of 2014. it is estimated that charter schools will begin to educate 20-40% of all public school students by 2035., charter schools accept all students, regardless of where they live or of their ethnicity. in fact, they must be non-discriminatory in admissions and serve all students, including those with disabilities, and their students tend to be as equally diverse as public school students in terms of both race and economic status.if applications to attend a charter school exceed spaces available, the enrollment is deemed by a lottery system, and students who do not get the opportunity to attend can be put on a wait list. , since they are public schools, charter schools are unable to charge tuition. therefore, they are based on a slightly different system than both private schools and district public schools. like public schools, charter schools are funded according to enrollment and receive funding from the district and state. however, unlike public schools, charter schools often don’t have access to capital or facilities funding, or they may receive less than districts do from these funding sources.in fact, charters receive on average 28% less funding, or 3,509 dollars per pupil, than their public school district peers, which could determine program cuts. , whereas public school teachers need teaching certifications, charter schools may hire educators that often have professional experience in their subject, but may not be traditionally credentialed. charter school employees also tend to be more diverse than district schools. for example, caucasian teachers make up 82% of district school", "if you are a visual learner, you should not choose verbal classes, like those found on podcasts. focus on flash cards, movies with subtitles and classes that employ visual aids. if you are an auditory learner, listen to music, download podcasts and listen to audio books. use the free audiovisual aids available on the internet to enhance your education. if you are a kinesthetic learner, then you will need to have interaction in your learning methods. take a class where you talk with students and teachers, order a software program where you play games or simply interact with spanish speakers as much as possible. although the latter is a good idea for anyone learning spanish, it will be especially important for you.; , another way to tailor your lessons is to use any time in the car or on public transportation as spanish learning time. download podcasts, books on tape or spanish language lessons. , the more methods that you employ that match your learning style the faster you are likely to learn. if you are willing to pay at least a few hundred dollars, sign up for spanish

improve reasoning skills is to keep trying new things. the mind is like any other muscle. it requires exercise and stimulation. make a point of trying out new hobbies and activities on a regular basis. pick activities that are vastly different from one another. if you're already an outdoor enthusiast, instead of taking up hiking consider learning to crochet. if you're big into crafts and working with your hands, consider trying to do crossword puzzles or sudoku in your spare time.take classes if possible. taking a pottery class or poetry class at a local community center can be a fun way to challenge your brain and encourage you to try new things.; , physical exercise actually has an effect on memory and thinking. many studies indicate the parts of the brain responsible for thinking and reasoning are bigger in those who exercise regularly. also, exercise reduces stress and anxiety and boosts mood, which can make it easier to concentrate and learn. strive to incorporate regular physical activity into your day-to-day routine. this can lead to an improvement in critical thinking skills. while researchers are still unsure if one form of exercise is better than another, some research indicates aerobic exercise is most helpful to mental stimulation., daily journaling can actually help improve critical thinking skills. in addition to helping you revisit your day, journaling encourages reflection and thought. writing is an active endeavor. it forces you to expand and explore your thoughts. keeping a journal that details your day, your feelings, and anything you thought about throughout the day can make you a more introspective, aware person. this can lead to higher reasoning skills.make time to journal every day. schedule regular journaling time into your day-to-day life as you would brushing your teeth, showering, and eating dinner. it may be helpful to schedule journal time after an activity you're accustom to doing every day, as this will make it easier to remember to keep up with your journal. , reading in general is great for improving critical thinking. however, fiction specifically can allow you to be more comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. this can lead to more sophisticated thinking as well as more creativity.fiction can force you to become more insightful about other perspectives due to the focus on character.this can make you more in tune to the cultures, belief systems, and skill sets of those around you. you may be better at, say, reasoning with those around you as you'll have a greater capacity for empathy. black and white thinking is also lessened through reading fiction. people who read fiction over time may have more sophisticated thought patterns as they're able to navigate and accept the ambiguity in a variety of situations., there are a variety of games that require you to reason. strategic board games, games like chess, and word games all help reasoning skills. look for board games that rely on more than just look. explore in depth strategy games where decision making is a key part of the process. schedule a regular game night", "compared to women, men have almost all of the same options for gym tops available (with the obvious exceptions of halter tops, etc.) men at the gym look best in tops that are functional, comfortable, and breathable. many men choose to wear ordinary cotton tee shirts, though, as always, modern moisture-wicking fabrics are an even more comfortable choice and usually look great as well. if you want to show off your arms, you also have the option of wearing an a-frame tee (tank top) or a sleeveless tee. these types of shirts sometimes even come with long slits along the sides to give a view of your abs and lats — though this style is sometimes considered \"bro-y\", it provides great ventilation and is not usually prohibited in gym dress codes. , generally, it's a little less acceptable for men to wear very short shorts to the gym than it is for women. showing upper thigh can be considered a fashion faux pas unless a man is on a cross country team, so, if you typically wear shorts, it's usually best to opt for longer styles. even shorts that hang past most men's knees aren't usually considered too baggy, so don't feel any need to shy away from longer styles. , while some men like to take off their shirts to cool down during a long jog or while playing sports, it's sometimes considered rude to do so at the gym. at gyms where this isn't common, taking off your shirt can make you look like a vain \"meathead\" in comparison to the other people exercising. in addition, if you get very sweaty when you exercise, removing your shirt can cause you to leave behind more sweat where you work out, which can gross out others. however, it's definitely worth noting that some men swear by the act of exercising shirtless, claiming it as a powerful motivating factor.if you're unsure whether it's considered rude to exercise shirtless at your gym, talk to the staff or simply observe the other members for a few days. , like taking off your shirt, letting out excessive noise while you exercise (especially while you lift weights) can make you appear vain or attention-seeking. it's also somewhat disrespectful of the people around you, for whom the extra noise may be somewhat awkward or intimidating. while some grunting may be unavoidable during heavy exercise, try to avoid loud grunts or screams to avoid giving the wrong impression of yourself. , the gym is for playing sports and exercising — not playing games of equipment one-upsmanship with other gym members. while it's perfectly acceptable to bring gloves, headbands, accessories, reading material, music playing devices, and anything else that makes your workout more comfortable or productive, these accessories shouldn't be a point of pride in and of themselves. having a great workout is the focus of your visit to the gym — everything else should just be a tool to help you achieve this. one recent gym trend is the use of elevation training masks during exercise. these masks partially", "this is dark souls’ tagline, and it is that way for a reason: you will die a lot in

area’s bonfires. bonfires are dark souls’ save points. use your acquired souls a soon as possible since dying twice without retrieving your souls makes your souls gone forever.; , facing the bosses of dark souls 2 means going head to head against some of gaming’s toughest bosses. you’re well-advised to study each boss’ movements and patterns. you should also equip weapons and spells appropriate to the boss you’re facing. upgrade your armor and weapon if you have souls to spare. level up and improve your stats so you can increase your chance of beating the bosses. , if you have friends online, you can ask for their assistance. meaning, you can summon them up in your game, and actually join you in your adventure. you can invite assistance from friends or other players by using an item called the summon sign. simply use it on the floor, and players can join you from this point. without actual friends online, make sure to summon ai players to beat bosses. summoning ai players requires summoning signs and you should be in human form. , this is the first boss that you will encounter in dark souls 2. well, at least the one you are supposed to beat first. he’s a huge tree-like creature with a powerful swing. he will also attempt to stomp on you, but you should be able to dodge that easily. the primary technique to beat the giant is to stay close to him. his stomps may intimidate you, but just roll away from them. strike his feet with your weapon and just watch out for the stomps. he will occasionally reposition himself, but no worries, just get close to him again. be aware of the battle area. make sure you don’t to get cornered by this giant. once you manage to lessen the giant’s health to 50%, it will remove its arm and use it to hit you. just the same, keep close to his feet, and you should be fine. there are times when the giant falls down. take this opportunity to hit him while he is caught off-guard. , you will have the chance to battle this boss early in the game on the plaza of the forest of fallen giants. however, that is just an optional battle—you will battle him for real at the top of a nearby tower. this boss employs speedy attacks, and can really deal serious damage, so watch out. you can use striking attacks plus lightning for this boss is weak against those. in order to deal a large amount of damage to the pursuer, align him with the ballista and fire away. keep in mind though that he can destroy those ballistas so use them early. his thrust", "in case you've decided to make changes to your lights after you’ve put up your tree, you should remove the lights for safety and ease of access.; , anytime you need to replace a bulb in a strand of lights, you should always find a replacement bulb with the same voltage as the original. look under the tag on the strand of lights to find voltage information. , some light strands blink because they have special bulbs that twinkle. if that’s the case with your lights, you can get rid of the twinkle feature by switching out the bulbs. oftentimes, the bulbs that blink on these strands will be marked with red or silver tips.however, if they aren’t marked, plug in the strand, let it warm up, and use a small piece of masking tape to mark each blinking bulb., first, unplug the lights. then, for each blinking bulb, hold the bulb by the base (where the light attaches to the strand) and pull out the bulb and the bottom casing. remove the bulbs from the casing.if you have trouble removing the bulb and casing, use a screwdriver to pry the light out. , for every blinking bulb that you removed, you want to replace it with a non-blinking bulb. insert the new bulb into the case, making sure the two wires on the end go through the holes in the bottom of the case. fold the wires back so they rest against the side of the casing. when you have finished, reinsert the new bulb and casing back into the base. , when you have replaced all the blinking bulbs and returned them all to their bases on the light strand, plug in the lights and test them. give them a few minutes to warm up. , some lights have the twinkle function run by a control box that contains wires and a simple electrical board. because this method involves cutting and splicing wires, it requires much more care and attention. before you start, it’s very important to ensure the lights are unplugged and not wrapped around the tree. , it will be a small rectangular box, and it’s usually located near the plug. you’ll know it’s the control box because the lights from the wires and the electrical plug will all run through it. , some are glued, some are screwed, and some are clipped together. you may need a screwdriver to remove the screws, or you may need one to pry apart the control box. once open, remove the contents of the box, including the electrical board and the wires. , use wire cutters or sharp scissors to cut the power cord where it’s connected to the electrical board. then, cut the hot wires and the neutral wire., for the hot and neutral wire, strip about an inch of the wire coating off each of the wires. an inch from the top, use the scissors to cut through just the top layer of coating. use your fingers, the scissors, or pliers to grip the coating and pull it off.", "for a better quality, efficient, and modern room you will need a bunch of money that ranges from $250-$600 canadian dollars.; ,, sort everything into four piles: keep, trash, give away and to decorate with. keep everything you want to keep, trash junk, recycle papers, give stuff away to family/friends, and donate the other stuff to goodwill or the salvation army. this is a pretty essential step, because it will help declutter your room as well as get rid of clothes that you don't want. empty your room of any unwanted toys, games etc. so you don't have to re-clean your room after. , this could include your bed, dresser, desk, drawers... , the best quality paints can typically be found at home improvement stores such as lowe's or home depot. color really helps change a room. if you don't want to repaint your room, your parents won't allow you to paint your walls, or if you can't afford paint, that's okay. move on to the next step. if they will, then get stuck in! pick a color that you like and that goes well with a lot of other things that are in your room. if you want, you can paint all of your walls the same color, but it can be even more interesting to paint a few different colors; this will provide variety. or, go nuts and paint each wall a different color, and have no theme whatsoever. do whatever you like! whatever you do, let your personality shine. if you and your parents are struggling to decide what color to paint your room, compromise. do your parents want you to paint your room light pink, but you want to paint it black (or vice versa)? compromise by painting your room light pink and use black as an accent. tape the paint samples to the wall when you get them, so you can get an idea of how they would look in your room. look at the wall that your 'future bed' will be and make it a darker shade, if you want to give your room some definition. , do you really want that abc dresser in your room? no way! go out and get some new furniture. you'll need a bed (of course), a dresser, a bookcase, a bedside table, and a desk. try buying all of your furniture in the same color so that your room doesn't look too crazy (unless that's your intention). look in thrift stores for bargain furniture finds. just check there is no insect infestation before dragging it home though; if you're not sure, take a flashlight along and do a close inspection. this is more of an issue in some places than others, so ask your parents for advice. consider repainting old furniture for a completely new look that matches your color scheme. to brighten and modernize your room a little, don't just buy a bed, dresser, desk etc., but a small couch and bedside table too. look at the color of the furniture that you want to buy and think", "let them know that you are doing this because it will make doing the laundry easier.many bedwetters are self-conscious about their bedwetting and the fact that they have to wear diapers and plastic pants to bed. having an older sibling help out with laundering the diapers and plastic pants might be embarrassing,that's why it's important to put their mind at ease about the whole situation.; , studies show that girls tend to mature faster than boys and might be more mature about handling this type of situation. also, the girl's maternal instinct tends to come into play, so they might be more sympathetic than a boy when it comes to helping out the parents with this chore. if the bedwetter is a boy, they might feel more comfortable with a girl dealing with this issue. on the other hand it could go the other way.my hunch is that a girl would be able to handle this in a more mature manner and be more empathetic about their brother or sister wearing diapers and plastic pants to manage their bedwetting. that being the case,this is just a rule of thumb and the parents have to gauge this based on their knowledge of the particular situation at hand. , if you feel they would be able to do this chore in a responsible, adult manner, then by all means, get them to help out in some way. i would say something along these lines: “i wanted to talk to you guys (if there's more than one daughter helping out) about something. i know you've noticed me laundering plastic pants (or \"rubber pants\" as they're sometimes called - you may know them by that term) and cloth diapers, you've seen plastic pants hanging on the clothesline, as well as me folding diapers and plastic pants up and putting them in a laundry basket. your brother has problems with bedwetting and he has to wear protection to bed. he uses pin-on cloth diapers covered with plastic pants to keep the bed dry. the reason i'm telling you this is because i would like you to help me with washing the diapers and plastic pants on the weekend. it would really help me out a lot if you'd pitch in with this. one of you can be responsible for laundering the diapers and plastic pants and one of you can hang the plastic pants on the clothesline to dry then fold the diapers and plastic pants up and put them in the laundry basket. or we can have one person be responsible for both laundering the diapers and plastic pants as well as folding them up and putting them in the laundry basket. in this case all of you can take turns with this chore – one of you will be responsible for doing this one weekend, the next weekend someone else will take care of the wet garments, etc. i'll leave it up to you to decide amongst yourselves how you want to handle this. i'll show you how to launder them. this is a very", "if possible, read the book multiple times, as repeat reads tend to lead a reader (or reviewer) to view aspects of the story, the setting and the character(s) in a new or different way. write down your notes or use a voice recorder to document any thoughts or impressions you have of the book as you are reading. they don't have to be organised or perfect, the idea is to brainstorm any impressions you may have of the book. , consider how the book fits or does not fit in it's genre or field of study. if necessary, use outside sources to familiarize yourself with the field of study and the genre of the book. for example, if you are reviewing a non-fiction book about the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s, consider reading other books that also examine the same scientific issue and period of scientific development. or if you are reviewing a work of fiction like nathaniel hawthorne's the scarlet letter, consider how hawthorne's book relates to other works of romanticism and historical fiction set in the same time period (the 17th century) as points of comparison. , the theme is often a lesson or overall message that the reader perceives between the lines. the theme can also be the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a book. authors may present multiple themes in their writing, especially works of fiction. pay attention to the preface, any quotes, and /or references in the book's introduction, as this content will likely shed light on the book's major themes and viewpoint. a simple way to determine one of the major themes of a book is to sum up the book in one word.so, for example, the major theme of the scarlet letter could be \"sin\". once you have your one word summary, stretch the single word into a message or lesson, such as \"sin can lead to knowledge but it can also lead to suffering.\" , ask yourself if the style suits the book's intended audience. remember that genre is a category of writing and style is the manner in which a subject is expressed or performed. so, depending on the style used, the author can present different viewpoints to the intended audience. for example, in the scarlet letter, hawthorne attempts to combine the writing style of the romantic period (1800-1855) with the common, every day language of the american puritans of the 1600s. hawthorne does this with long, descriptive sentences that are strung together with commas and semi-colons, and he also uses antiquated word choices and descriptors that are rooted in the romantic period and in puritan terms inspired by the bible., what areas are covered/not covered? why? locating gaps in the timeframe or character development of the book can help you think critically. as well, noticing any well developed elements of the book will help you create good points for your review. , elements like the book's layout, binding, typography, etc. can provide framing and context for the book. if the author provides secondary material like maps, charts,", "in order to teach effectively, you need to know who your students are. you should also know what they want or need to learn from you. this will affect your teaching approach, as well as what you actually teach. for example, if you are teaching elementary school kids, you might focus on basic grammar rules that are easy to grasp. if you are teaching adults who are learning english as a second language, you might find these students to be older and highly motivated. they also may need immediate language skills.; , people learn in different ways depending on how they process information most effectively. think about different styles of learning as you begin to plan how to teach grammar. some of these learning styles include:visual learning: these learners prefer reading and want to see what they’re learning. auditory learning: these learners prefer to listen to instruction. conversations and interactions are effective ways of teaching this learning style. tactile learning: these learners prefer to touch and manipulate objects in order to learn about something. kinesthetic learning: these learners move around a lot and benefit from getting up from a desk frequently. , take some time to go through a grammar guide or textbook. even if you think you know grammar really well, spend some time refreshing your memory about different rules. , you might choose to use a textbook as a guide for teaching. choose one that is geared toward the same type of students that you will be teaching. , the deductive approach of teaching grammar focuses on teaching certain grammar rules and then giving examples of that rule.it can be useful if you want to quickly explain grammar. it may be more useful with adult students. this approach can minimize student interaction and involvement. clearly state what the rule allows and limits. give a clear and brief explanation about what the grammar rule allows. also describe what the rule does not allow. for example, always use “you were” and never use “you was.” then follow up with an example of the rule. illustrate the grammar rule with an example. you can use a simple sentence to illustrate it once. then you might choose a more complicated sentence to demonstrate how the rule applies. describe the rules with simplicity. boil down the grammatical rules to simple terms. try not to point out too many exceptions to the rule when you first introduce the rule. , the inductive approach allows students to discover how language and grammar works. students learn grammar by making connections with their pre-existing understanding of language. for example, students learning english as a second language will learn to link english grammar rules to their native language grammar rules. this approach may allow for better memory retention of grammar. in addition, students are more autonomous learners. don’t choose the inductive approach if you don’t have lots of time. students need to work out a rule on their own by going through examples. figuring out the rule may be at the expense of using the rule in practice. give sentence", "oxygen is the ultimate source of energy and essential for the proper functioning of your vocal instrument. take long deep breaths, filling up your lungs from the bottom up as often as possible. after your breathe deeply, apply a little bit of pressure from your diaphragm to project your voice effortlessly. to understand how to use your diaphragm correctly, pretend that you are blowing candles on a birthday cake. the downward motion felt in the abdomen is the diaphragm engaging. just a little bit of pressure is necessary to support the voice. let your belly out when inhaling and always push down slightly (not in) while exhaling.; , the placement and pitch of your voice should sit in the middle of your range. be mindful of not speaking too low, too high, too nasal or with rasp. to find your natural dynamic voice, answer a few questions positively with “mmmm”. there you go! that is your natural pitch. try to speak at that level most of the time. , take time to pause often in order to take long deep breaths. slowing down your speech and carefully enunciating allows your instrument to align itself and relax open its resonance chamber. , drink 5 to 6 bottles of water a day to maintain the elasticity of your vocal cords. this is the daily recommended amount. avoid drying agents such as caffeinated drinks and soda. gargle water to hydrate and massage your throat instantly! , try to pick up on signs of vocal fatigue early and be pro-active. rasp, the frequent need to clear the throat, change in tone, and soreness are evident signs of irritation. if you notice these, pause and take a moment to realign yourself. , do not smoke or use drugs, eat healthy, and exercise regularly. to protect yourself from catching the common cold or flu, wash your hands often and keep them away from

of vocal usage at work, especially when you feel vocal fatigue or you are getting sick. stay home if you catch a cold or the flu and do not talk! , demand silence from your audience before initiating a lecture. wait for quiet environments for private conversations as opposed to clubs for example. , learn to love your voice! completely let go of the ego and accept that it's ok to make mistakes and that we cannot be perfect all the time. proper guidance, solid technique and daily practice should fix any concerns you may have. determination and perseverance will take you a long way. set realistic

rejection. strive to keep busy throughout the day. if you don't keep busy, you're likely to start ruminating and having negative thoughts about yourself and the guy.take up hobbies you enjoy. if you're interested in knitting, start a new knitting project. if you're an outdoorsy type, take up hiking. try to keep busy with a hobby during most of the day when you have downtime. when you're likely to start engaging with troublesome thoughts, find something to do. if you're lying awake at night pondering what went wrong and why, read a book instead or listen to a podcast on your phone.; , meeting new people and exploring new activities can also keep your mind occupied. consider joining a class in and getting involved in your community. stop by a local community center and see what they offer. something like, say, a cooking class can help you expand your social circle and make new friends. a new social circle can keep your mind off the guy who rejected you. eventually, your feelings for him will taper off. , you cannot entirely eliminate or control your feelings. however, changing the way you think about your internal feelings can help you gain some distance from them. try thinking of your feelings as a third party rather than a part of yourself. this can help you gain some distance.think about your feeling as an intrusive third party who continually interrupts your thoughts and emotions. if you're having an otherwise good day, and suddenly unwanted thoughts arise, think to yourself, \"here comes that force again to bother me.\" this can feel awkward at first, but with some practice you'll be able to do it somewhat unconsciously. this can provide you with appropriate distance from your emotions, allowing you to move forward. , heartbreak can be a major

about how breasts develop and whether you have any control over their size. in general, you have no control over when your breasts develop, or what size they’ll end up being. there are no exercises you can do to make your breasts turn out larger or smaller. breasts are made most of fatty tissue and milk ducts, not muscle. sleeping on your stomach will not impact your breasts in any way (although if they’re tender, this might be uncomfortable).there is also nothing that a bra can do to make your breasts larger or smaller, even if you wear it at night while you sleep (which is not needed).,

kept in a pot only slightly larger than itself, or its roots may rot and die.fill a pot 1/3 of the way full with the prepared potting mix and place the anthurium on top. fill in with additional potting mix around the sides. typically, the roots of the plant will continue to grow above the potting material, so begin with this low level of fill to delay the need to transplant your anthurium to a larger pot.if you are using a potting mix with less coarse material or worse drainage, consider one or two layers of pebbles at the base of the container to speed up water drainage. , anthurium plants thrive in daytime temperatures between 80 and 90ºf (27–32ºc). if this is not possible, the plant will typically survive indoors at temperatures above 60ºf (15.5ºc), but warmer is better.avoid direct sun, which may burn the plant, but keep it in a bright location to encourage blooming. a south- or east-facing windowsill is a good option (north- or east-facing if you are in the southern hemisphere).place the plant 5–8 feet (1.5–2.4 m) (1.5-2.5m) from a window for some gentle sunlight. if night temperatures dip below 40ºf (4.4ºc), the leaves may yellow and growth will likely slow. the plant rarely survives long if temperatures fall below freezing (32ºf / 0ºc).do not keep plants directly in front of heaters and heating vents, which may burn them. , mimic the humid, tropical environment of anthurium plants by keeping the room at 80% humidity or higher.placing the pot in an aquarium or a shallow tray of pebbles in water will help achieve a high level of humidity. mist the plant weekly, or daily if you live in a dry climate, making sure to spray portions of the stem that have grown over the lip of the pot., water in small amounts as necessary to prevent the soil from drying out. even in hot weather, the soil does not need watering more than once every two or three days, as the plant does not soak up large amounts of water from its roots. if the leaves turn yellow (but not brown and withered), this may be a sign of overwatering. let the soil dry out before watering again if this occurs., most anthurium plants in nature, but probably the minority sold as houseplants, are \"epiphytic,\" meaning they grow on other", "if you're preparing the affidavit to be submitted as part of a court case, the heading at the top of the affidavit document should be the case caption, which identifies the case in question. formatting the case caption properly will ensure your affidavit is recognized by the attorneys, prosecutors and legal clerks. to create a case caption, start by creating a centered heading that identifies the court venue. for example, \"supreme court of new jersey.\" next write the names of the defendants and plaintiffs, positioned below and to the left of the heading. if you do not know the names, find a copy of another legal document filed in the case, such as the complaint. write the case number and position it below the heading, to the right.; , write the word \"affidavit\" just below the caption, in the center of the page. if your document does not include a case caption, \"affidavit\" should appear centered at the top of the page. , these should be left-aligned, with the state appearing above the county. , this part of the affidavit is called a \"commencement,\" and it's where the full name of the affiant (the person making the statement for the affidavit) should be listed. this part is commonly worded as follows: \"comes now and states as follows:\"if the affidavit is for a court case, the statement should read, \"comes now , being first duly sworn, under oath, and states as follows:\" , certain types of affidavits require information about the affiant, other than his or her name. this information appears in the first paragraph, numbered \"1,\" and may include:the address of the affiant. if the address of the affiant is important to the facts described and sworn to, it should be included in the affidavit. for example, when signing an affidavit of residence for the bureau of motor vehicles (\"bmv\") so that your child may obtain a driver’s license, you are swearing that your child lives with you within the state. therefore, your address is important to the facts of the affidavit and should be included. the age or date of birth of the affiant. the age and/or date of birth of the affiant should be included in the affidavit if it is relevant to the subject matter. for example, when circumstances require that the affiant be a certain age, such as when inheriting from a trust fund that requires him or her to have reached the age of 25 to receive the inheritance, then age should be included. the occupation of the affiant. the occupation of the affiant should be included when the affiant is signing as an expert or qualified person. for example, a doctor testifying in a malpractice case as an expert witness or a mechanic certifying the cost of repairs to a car would want to include their occupation. the immigration status of the affiant. when providing an affidavit to support an immigration petition, you should include the affiant’s own immigration status. the relationship of the affiant to the litigant(s). the relationship of the affiant to one or", "the chick's parents will care for it as best as they can, but you should regularly check on the health and development of the chick. if the chick develops an illness, you may need to consult a veterinarian. by the time the chick is a few days old, it should show some bright colour, and should be beginning to put on weight. generally a lighter chick is more disposed to illness or is being targeted by red mites. if your chick doesn't appear to be developing or gaining weight, consider contacting your vet or handfeeding if you can. once your chick has begun to develop feathers, and they have reached about half an inch long (approximately 1cm), they should feel strong when you touch them., if you think your chick is not developing properly, you should consult a vet for some expert advice, but there are some basic checks that you can do at home to help the chick develop healthily. the first of these is to look under the top mandible (beak). if you notice a build-up of food, this can lead to an undershot beak. if you see some food stuck there, very carefully remove it with a toothpick. if you think that your chick is beginning to develop splayed legs, try adding some extra bedding to the nest.if the chick cannot stand up straight, perch, or walk around easily, he may have splayed legs. look to see if the legs lean out to the sides rather than underneath the body.if you are uncertain or you think your chick is ill, don't hesitate to contact your vet. , once the chick starts coming out of the nest on his own, you can help the process of weaning along, and then help him leave the nest. once you notice the chick coming out of the nest, you should provide a shallow dish of food and place it at the bottom of the cage. the chick will start eating the food from the dish, beginning the weaning process.you should allow the chick to wean by itself, but monitor it closely to ensure that it is eating enough.provide a dish of fresh water so the chick can learn to drink from it. monitor the chicks and parents; when they have not been fed by the parents for at least a week, have not asked for feeds and you can see they are cracking seeds and filling their crops well you can considered them weaned. , once a chick is weaned you can remove him the from the nest. this will help his development and the development of any younger chicks in the nest. put the weaned chick in a large cage that you have set aside for young birds. ensure the cage has plenty of food placed in different areas, but especially in a dish at the bottom of the cage, and a supply of fresh water. keep a close watch on the young birds and check that they are eating sufficiently. make sure the bird's crop is full before covering the cage", "when your team is moving as a group, you can advance in a few different ways: a loose diamond (one person eyes front, one left, one right, and one checking flanks and 6:00), staggered columns (the image for this is slightly off, picture the left column a mirror image of the right) (two eyes front, middle(s) right and left, and rear: flanks and 6:00). those are for general movement in a non-combat situation.; , when a team is moving while engaging move one person at a time so you can provide cover for each-other. , when you are superior (in this situation steadily advance on the enemy's position but be cautious you can still lose a team member even if you outnumber them, also be ready for an ambush). when the enemy is superior (it is advisable to fall back to a better position, either get to high ground, good cover, or get entrenched and use your skill to take control of the situation if you take out a few of their members even when you are outnumbered the enemy may become demoralized and fall back, that is your opportunity to strike. advancing; (when you advance on an enemy make sure to know were their entire unit is, going after one person instead of after a territory can easily lead to an ambush or being flanked and surrounded, even with the upper hand make sure you have a clean exit route in case something comes up) falling back (when you are out-gunned or become separated from your team you need to fall back to a safer position, don't try to shoot your way out, move fast and low, and stick to cover whenever possible, try to randomize your movement so they can't let you run into their fire, it's always better to fall back with your team then to try to be a hero and hold them off) flanking (flanking can provide a huge tactical advantage, treat the enemy a a single point that you are going to circle around and entrap, the best way to get behind an enemy position is to have half the team provide heavy fire on their front or provide some other distraction so the rest of the team can get around them and hit their sides or 6. , ambushes can take out and entire team if done properly, when ambushing an enemy lure them into a spot by either having a team member be bait (a lonely ill equipped soldier looks like a tempting target) or in a capture the flag scenario have the flag be the bait, the bait should be in a position either in a low point or with no cover so when the enemy arrives they have no cover as well, place your team in a position to flank the enemy and prevent their retreat. superior firing positions can be a great advantage, when scouting out an area for a firing position look for waist high cover, high ground, trenches, and have environmental factors on your side, put the sun in", "place the tip on your pointer finger, the midsection resting on the tip of your middle finger, your thumb on top between those two fingers, and the fingernail of your ring finger touching the inside of the pencil. got it? cool. the pencil will feel as if it's dangling by the tips of your fingers, and this is necessary to do the flip. your hand should be relaxed and loose at this point, too. it'll feel a little precarious, but that's how the pencil's going to get around and around.; , part of the initial thrust will be from your ring finger as it straightens out, sending the pen around your middle finger. you may find that your pinky finger immediately follows suit, too. don't mind the pinky – it tends to do its own thing. this is only part of the entire picture. you can practice this movement, but it won't be perfect until you line up the rest of your fingers and put them to work, too. , let's cover them each separately: the pencil was resting on the pad of your pointer finger. as you go to thrust it around your middle finger, simple extend it outward, taking it off the pencil. you'll need it for the landing, but for the initial thrust, just get it out of the way. your thumb, on the other hand, should slide down the pencil toward the tip. when it lifts up, this is the release of the tip of the pencil, with your ring finger propelling the base. these two movements are what gets it around your middle finger. just like your pointer finger, the thumb comes off for the initial flip around and then will be there to catch it in motion. , once the thumb releases the tip and the ring finger propels the pencil back, bring your middle finger toward you, bending it ever-so-slightly forward. this allows your pointer finger and thumb to catch it as it comes around. this is a very small movement. if you move it too much, the pen will just go flying – and your teacher won't be thrilled with you. , as the pencil rotates around your middle finger and comes around full circle, stop it with your thumb. as the thumb stops it, bring up your pointer finger to catch it from the bottom. and there you have it – that's one entire spin for the record books. , when you catch the pen as it comes around, return your fingers to the pre-flip position. then, it's practice, practice, practice. when the pencil spins all the way around the middle finger, it should land right in the skin between index finger and thumb. at the same time it lands, grip the pencil with any finger and any part of your thumb. the pencil should be able to land in the writing position or something similar to it. this is a good transition to end the trick. , as you're learning to do this, start out as if you're doing it in slow", "using eye drops or artificial tears can help moisturize dry eyes, which may relieve eye soreness. you can use plain saline (salt water that matches the salt in tears) or medicated eye drops. follow the manufacturer’s instructions. don’t become dependent on eye drops. if you use eye drops frequently, make sure they do not have medication or preservatives in them. overusing medicated eye drops can actually aggravate eye problems.; , using a warm compress can help relax the muscles around your eye, which may relieve eye strain and that twitchy feeling tired eyes get. you can use dry or moist warmth, depending on what feels best for you. if you wear glasses or contacts, remove them before using any compress.for a dry compress, fill a clean sock with uncooked rice or beans and knot the sock to keep it closed. microwave the sock for about 30 seconds, or until it’s warm but not too hot. apply the compress to your eye. for a moist compress, wet a clean washcloth or several paper towels with warm (almost, but not quite, hot) water. lay the cloth across your eyes. you can apply gentle pressure with your palm if you want, but don’t press too hard. leave the compress on until it cools. , using your palms to apply gentle pressure to your eye area can help reduce eye strain and relieve pain. if you wear them, remove your glasses or contacts before using your palms as a compress. cross your hands with your palms facing you. gently press the palms of your hands against your eyes. continue for 30 seconds, then relax. repeat as often as necessary to reduce soreness. , some herbs, such as chamomile, goldenseal, eyebright, calendula, and oregon grape/barberry, have anti-inflammatory properties that may help soothe your eyes.while there is no scientific evidence to suggest that a tea bag is more effective than another warm compress, you may find the herbal aroma relaxing.place two tea bags in a mug and pour boiling water over them. allow the tea to steep for about five minutes, or until the water is still warm but not hot. squeeze excess liquid from the tea bags and place one over each eye. lean your head back and relax. once the tea bags have cooled, remove them. you can repeat this as often as you want. if you can’t find tea bags, you can cut the toes off a nylon knee-high stocking, pour the dried herb into the toe, tie it off, and use it as a tea bag. , it’s every teenager’s favorite weapon, but the eye-roll can also help relieve eye strain. close your eyes and focus on breathing deeply while you perform the following motions: roll your eyes clockwise. then roll them counter-clockwise. this full movement is one complete eye-roll. repeat the eye-roll 20 times. start off slowly and get a bit faster each time. do this 2-4 times a day to help relieve and prevent eye strain. , try to stand up, move around, and shake yourself out every hour or so. this", "this is a very important decision. some people prefer spiral notebooks, as it will keep all of your notes in one place, while others prefer a three-ring binder that they can open and close. the choice is up to you and should be based on which one you think will keep you most organized. a three-ring binder has the benefit that you can open it, put paper in, and take your paper out. this can be helpful if your teacher asks to see your work. however, it can take up a lot of room if you buy a big one.organize your three-ring binder if you buy one. get tab dividers and create a tab for each one of your classes: science, math, social studies, reading, writing, and any other classes you attend. this way, you will have your notes and work from each class in a separate place. , in each class, you may get a lot of \"hand-outs,\" or xeroxed papers. you need to keep these papers organized. if you get a folder for each class, and label each folder with the class name, then you can easily keep your loose papers organized.bring the folders with you to class. if you get a handout, put it into the folder immediately after you are done looking at it in class. if you scared of the papers falling out of a folder, pocket files that close completely are a nice substitute. clean out your folders once a week. take out old handouts and make room for new handouts. some spiral notebooks come with pockets between sections. these can function well for keeping loose papers organized. if you have a spiral notebook with pockets, be sure to use a specific pocket for each class, and don't just stash your handouts in a random pocket. , these may include: pencils, pens, a ruler, and paper, among many other things. you may also need to get a new backpack or school bag at the beginning of the school year.if you have separate classes with separate teachers, you may be able to use some of the same supplies for several classes. look at the supply lists given to you by all of your teachers and compare what each requires. if there is overlap in general supplies, such as pencils, then you can probably use them for multiple classes. if a teacher says you will need a certain supply for their class, get it. having the right supplies will help you to succeed in a given class. , if you have a locker, make sure all of its contents are neatly organized. this way you can easily find the folders and textbooks that you need when you need them. you may need to share a locker with another student. they may not be as tidy as you are, so you will need to negotiate with them about what space is yours and what space is theirs, so that you can keep your section neat at least. to keep your locker organized, decide where all of your stuff should", "get out a large bowl and put all of the dry ingredients into it. stir the ingredients until they're combined and then set the bowl aside. for the dry ingredients, you'll need:2 1/2 cups (312 g) all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking

sticker attached to the front access panel. improper usage or maintenance of your furnace could result in the furnace not functioning, fires, explosions, property damage, personal injury, or death.some furnaces may no longer have attached instructions or these may be difficult to read due to label dirtiness or deterioration. your furnace user manual should include a copy of all instructions. if you’ve misplaced your manual, look it up online with a keyword search for the furnace make and model number. because there are many different furnace designs, a diagram can be useful when locating various parts. furnace diagrams are generally found in the user manual.; , smell the area around your furnace, including low to the floor. some gas may be heavier than air and sink to the floor, escaping immediate notice. there should be no leaks or water on or around the furnace. water can cause dangerous shorts in your furnace electrical components. if you detect gas, do not turn on any appliances, light switches, or phones. evacuate the building completely and contact your gas company from outside or next door for further instruction. if there are leaks, turn off electricity to your furnace. repair leaking pipes and dry the area completely before returning power to the furnace. if any furnace electrical components were submerged in water, do not turn the furnace on. call a furnace technician to inspect your furnace and replace ruined parts., if your furnace has been off for the warm months, you may need to restore power to the furnace at your home electrical panel or fuse box. these are usually found in your basement, utility room, or garage. the furnace fuse or breaker should be in the “on” position., the front access panel is often held in place with screws. unfasten these, if necessary, with a screwdriver or suitable tool. set the panel off to the side. keep the screws in a location they won’t be lost, like in a plastic baggie.taking off the access panel should give you an improved view of the pilot light. additionally, some controls, like the gas supply, may be located behind this panel. , a description of the ideal flame for your pilot should included in your manual. generally, the flame should not be excessively yellow, it should not be split into two or more flames, and it should not flicker or waver., most pilot lights can be adjusted by turning a screw on the body of the pilot valve. reach into the access panel and insert a suitable screwdriver into the slot of the pilot screw. turn it counterclockwise to intensify the flame and clockwise to diminish it. verify the pilot adjustment screw in the furnace manual before adjusting it. turning the incorrect screw could dangerously impact the performance of your pilot. depending on your furnace, the ideal pilot light may differ slightly. most home models will have a full and steady flame that is between 1½ and 2 in (3.8 and 5 cm) tall.after adjusting your", "determine where on the fingers and on which finger you’d like to place a tattoo, as you have several options. knuckle tattoos are generally placed between either the first and second or second and third knuckles of any finger, on the flat back surface. lettering across multiple “knuckles” is commonly suited to this placement, which is more likely to hold ink well than anywhere else on the finger, given that it is less often in contact with other fingers. tattoos can be placed on the side of any finger, as in where two fingers might touch when together. small images and even words are commonly inked here. ring tattoos mimic the band of a metal ring by going all the way around a finger. note that this and any other finger tattoo that has ink on the inside of the hand can more easily blur and fade because it is frequently exposed to movement, sweat, sun, and washing.; , come to a sure decision about the design of your tattoo and whether it will be in color or black and white. consider popular designs for finger tattoos, which include simple lettering, symbols, and sentimental or marital themed pieces for a creative alternative to traditional rings and wedding bands. avoid very intricate, detailed, or precise designs, as a finger affords very little space for tattoo art, and the ink may not hold color and detail as well as other areas due to the nature of the skin.with any tattoo, it’s a good idea to visit a tattoo artist in your process of deciding on a design, whether you are familiar with their art and want to leave more creative control to them, or you want to see how they’ll interpret a very specific design that you want. , if you are getting a permanent tattoo done, do your research into any tattoo parlor you’re interested in, as well as the specific artist who will work on you. note that there are some tattoo shops and artists who will not perform finger tattoos as a general rule, usually because they believe ink does not take as well to the skin on the fingers. definitely be sure to check with the shop about their policies ahead of time. examine the shop itself for cleanliness and proper disposal methods, as well as looking into the license and certifications of any artist. be willing to pay more for a quality shop or an artist with more experience.if you are opting for a henna tattoo or other temporary method, search for shops that apply henna or buy your own online or in stores. , get used to having a finger tattoo design by creating a temporary one and continuing to redo it to determine if you still like it over time. get a henna tattoo with your design for something that will last for up to a couple weeks. you can have the tattoo redone or do it yourself to test it out for an even longer period. try a premade temporary tattoo from any store, or make", "like other over-the-counter treatments, you can buy whitening strips from the store. as their name implies, they are strips that fit over your teeth.to use, you cover the front of your teeth with the strips and then leave them on for 30 minutes. you must do this every day for about two weeks. make sure that you brush your teeth before you use the whitening strips. this will provide better strip-to-tooth contact, which should improve your results. you'll need to do this treatment about three times a year. while this option is one of the more expensive ones for over-the-counter treatments, it is somewhat more effective than other over-the-counter treatments.; , another option is paint-on gels. basically, you apply the gel to your teeth with a small brush. you also have to leave this gel on for about 30 minutes.some of these types of whiteners are simply a pen filled with the gel that has a brush on one end.usually, you apply the whitener once or twice a day, with about the same effectiveness as strips. it can be applied to just one or two teeth, if you need it. also, one disadvantage is it can come off pretty easily after you've brushed it on. the gel is usually not strong enough to cause tooth sensitivity, but it is still important to avoid placing the gel on your gums to avoid causing any burns. , with whitening trays, you place a whitening agent in a tray, and then you put that on your teeth. you leave these on for a period of time, then take them off.this method can be more effective than strips or brush-on gel.the best kind are the ones that you mold to your teeth at home. some are not designed to be molded to your teeth and therefore, are harder to keep on.however, trays that your dentist make will be more effective, as they will be made to fit your teeth allowing the gel to spread equally over your teeth and stay coat the entire tooth surface., whitening toothpastes may not be as effective as other options. however, they can provide some results, and they are by far one of the cheapest options.whitening toothpastes can use special abrasive material as well as chemicals to whiten your teeth. toothpastes do not contain peroxide, like some other whitening options do. use a whitening toothpaste to replace a normal toothpaste. use twice a day, and you may see results in a month to a month and a half. however, look for a brand that's approved by the american dental association, as others can damage your teeth over time due to the abrasive ingredients used to remove stains.toothpastes with blue covarine may show results more quickly. you can also follow with a whitening mouthwash., one way you may be able to get professional whitening for less is at a dental school. as dentists are learning, they need to practice their skills. because they are practicing, services will be at a discounted rate to you.check with your local colleges and universities to see", "passion is a phenomenon that is created. it is not a spontaneous thing that just happens. in order to understand how to create passion, you must do two things. first, you need to understand why you feel passion. then you need to understand how passion is created.; , do you have a job that you love? is there a hobby you can't live without? maybe you have a talent you live for. regardless of what it is, there are many different things in life that can make you feel passionately. it could be a wonderful career, or your brand new sports car, a young puppy, playing video games, painting pottery, dancing, pretending you're a superstar when it's karaoke night at the bar, etc. the list is endless. take a moment and try to identify the things you have in your life that make you feel passion. , now that you have identified what it is that makes you feel this way, think about why it is that these things make you feel passionate. why are you passionate about your job/hobby/talent/pet? one thing you will notice about anything that makes you feel passionate is that this is something that makes you feel happy. feeling passionate is a good feeling. passions are often developed from feelings of love and happiness. it is the love and happiness we feel for these things that grows into a passion over time. therefore, with time, it is possible for passion to become stronger. never give up hope when the passion in your marriage is dwindling. remain hopeful that you will feel passionately with your partner again, starting with learning how to make each other happy. , learn how to make your partner happy and teach your partner how to make you happy. any true passion thrives off of happiness. you need to take the time to understand your partner's wants and needs. sometimes we can even be unaware of what our wants and needs are, so doing this can take a great deal of effort. if you are having trouble figuring out what your own wants and needs are, then start by being honest with yourself. you can ask yourself and/or your partner the following questions to help you learn what your wants and needs are: what do i want from my partner? what do i need from my partner to make me happy? what is making me feel sad and/or angry in my relationship? what do i need to change in my life to create my own happiness? , the first two questions will help you identify what you need and desire from a romantic relationship to feel fulfilled by it. the last two questions will help you learn how you can work towards making your relationship more satisfying to you. after you answer the third question, take your answers and write down the opposite for each one. for example, if your partner's distance and lack of affection makes you feel sad, then for the opposite, you should write that closeness and affection from your partner makes", "although it is possible to detect dishonesty and lying, it is also possible to misread deception where there is none. a range of factors could be causing a person to appear as if he or she is lying when the \"signs\" might be due to embarrassment, shyness, awkwardness or a sense of shame/inferiority. a stressed person can be easily mistaken for a liar, as some of the manifestations of stress mimic the indicators of lying indicators. for this reason, it is important that any observation of a person suspected of lying involves drawing together a \"cluster\" of deceptive behaviors and responses, as there is no single \"aha!\" sign., when assessing the body language, verbal responses and other indicators indicative of lying, consider factors such as:is the person unduly stressed in general, not just from the situation in which he or she is in now? is there a cultural factor involved? perhaps the behavior is culturally appropriate in one culture but is seen as dishonest behavior in another. are you personally biased or prejudiced against this person? do you want this person to be lying? be careful of falling into this trap! is there a history of this person lying? namely, is he or she experienced at it? is there a motive and do you have a good reason for suspecting lying? are you actually any good at reading lies? have you taken into account the entire context and not simply zoomed in on one or two possible indicators? , this includes not showing any signs that you suspect the other person of lying and making an effort to mirror his or her body language and pace of conversation. when questioning the person, act in an understanding, not overbearing, manner. this approach will help to let down the other person's guard and can help you to read the signs more clearly. , a baseline is how someone behaves when he or she is not lying. this will help you tell if the way the person is acting currently is any different from how they usually act. begin by getting to know the person if you don't already and proceed from there — people usually answer basic questions about themselves truthfully. for someone you already know, checking for a baseline might include asking the person about something the answer of which you already know. , usually, when people are lying, they will tell stories that are true, but are deliberately aimed at not answering the question you asked. if a person responds to the question \"did you ever hit your wife?\" with an answer such as \"i love my wife, why would i do that?\" the suspect is technically telling a truth, but is avoiding answering your original question. this may indicate that he or she is lying or trying to conceal something from you. , if you're really not sure whether they're telling the truth, ask them to repeat the story multiple times. it's hard to keep track of information that isn't truthful. in the process of repeating their made-up story, the liar", "a chinese jump rope goes around the holders’ ankles, so the best type of rope for this game is a loop made of rubber or some other type of stretchy material. some toy shops even sell elastic circular ropes that are meant for playing chinese jump rope. you can also use a 9 to 12 foot (2.7 to 3.7 m) long elastic band. just tie the ends together to form a circle.; , you will need at least three people to play chinese jump rope, but you can play with more than three as well. two of the players will be the rope holders and one (or more) will be the jumpers., the rope will need to be stretched out so that it looks like a long, skinny rectangle. make sure that you have enough space to play. you should have several feet on each side so that jumpers can run in and out of the ropes. , the holders should step into the ends of the rope so that they are facing each other. they should stand with their feet about shoulder-width apart and inch back a bit until the rope is taut.there should be enough space for a third player to safely jump between the first two players. if there isn’t enough room, then you need a longer rope! , chinese jump rope patterns can be made up of basic moves in any combination or order you want. the basic moves include:in: the jumper’s feet land inside the rope. out: the jumper’s feet land on one side of the rope. right: the jumper’s right foot lands inside the rope. left: the jumper’s left foot lands inside the rope. on: the jumper’s feet land on the rope. turn: the jumper spins in mid-air to face the opposite direction. straddle: the jumper’s feet land on either side of the rope. , to play chinese jump rope, you will need to come up with a pattern for the holders to call out as the jumper jumps. you can make the pattern as short or as long as you want, but keep in mind that the longer the pattern, the more difficult it will be. the pattern can be something simple or more advanced. some sample patterns include: in-out-in-out-on out-on-right-in-out-on-left-in in-straddle-turn-right-out , when you have decided on the pattern to use, the holders and jumper can all chant it together while the jumper jumps. if the jumper does all of the moves successfully, then you can speed it up or try a harder pattern. if the jumper messes up, then someone else can have a turn. , if the jumper completes the pattern without touching the rope, you can also raise it a little higher. then, the jumper must complete the same pattern at this new height. keep raising the rope until the jumper touches it or makes a mistake.start out with the rope around the holders' ankles, then move it up to their knees, and then move it up to their waists. , you can make chinese jump rope harder by having the", "earbuds are best for people who are short on space, but still want a way to listen to their music. the higher-quality earbuds, like from sennheiser or ultimate ears, usually come with little cases to put your earbuds in when you're not using them, so they won't get ruined or dirty at the bottom of your bag. if you keep a very small purse and want to keep your ipod nano and earbuds together in it, or you're a guy with limited pocket space, earbuds are probably a better choice. they're also great if you are on a limited budget, because there's a lot more to choose from and they tend to cost less. cheaper earbuds often run into problems like falling out of ears, hurting ears, or simply making dents in them from the cheap plastic. with higher prices (but still low-end in terms of quality) ranging from $25-50, you'll get more comfortable 'buds, and they are well-worth the money you spend. however, if you're an audiophile, you should consider other options. a pair of buds from sennheiser (like the cx 500, $130), shure (se 115, $120), etymotic research (hf5, $150), sony (xba-h1, $150), or even ultimate ears (minimum super.fi 4) will be preferable. headphones are great if you enjoy putting them around your neck while you're walking from one place to another, or if you just carry your headphones that way. you also tend to get beefier cords and fun options like wireless/bluetooth headphones. the drawback is that good headphones within your budget might be hard to find. they take up more space than earbuds, and the dj-style headphones take up a ridiculous amount of space if you don't carry around a larger bag. dj-style headphones are just that. huge, bulky, awesome-looking headphones that are reminiscent of what you'd see someone named double d mix his jams with. the structure lends itself to good sound containment but bad size usage. and a lot of music buffs get them because of the better sound quality and less pressure exuded on the eardrum, resulting in longer listening time and less damage to the eardrum. behind-the-neck headphones are exactly that as well, headphones with a connecting band that goes behind the neck instead of over the top of the head. this is recommended for joggers or people who wear hats a lot and also for sunglasses fanatics. therefore, if you're a girl (or guy) with long hair, and you hate headphones that press your hair down or dislike headphones that irritate your ear piercings, this type would be a good choice. besides that, there are very few things that separate them from dj-style or \"regular\" headphones. ; , generally, more expensive headphones are made with higher quality materials and better engineering, improving the sound quality. $30 headphones will sound good, but not as good as $60 ones. up in the $80-90 range, you may hear stuff in your music that you've never heard before. $9.99 bargain bin earbuds or headphones may last, at longest, a year, and will not sound great to begin", "you may go to an appointment unsure whether or not medications are right for you or your child. come prepared

prescriber will put you on the medication that best suits your needs. atomoxetine is a long-acting medication and can last 24 hours or more. this makes it appealing for people who have a difficult time “getting going” in the morning or notice the steep decline of functioning when medication starts to wear off. it is not as effective at treating symptoms of hyperactivity.atomoxetine has antidepressant properties, which can be a good fit for people also struggling with symptoms of depression. atomoxetine has a low potential for abuse or recreational use.if you have a history of prescription abuse or drug history, atomoxetine may be a good alternative to stimulants. ask your doctor about starting with a lose dose of medication and increasing it if necessary. this way you can

shimmers. this can usually be detected with the naked eye if you have a clear view of the sky and if you watch the sky for long enough.stars twinkle and shimmer - hence, the song \"twinkle, twinkle little star.\" planets do not twinkle. they remain constant in their brightness and their overall appearance in the night sky. if viewed through a telescope, planets may appear to \"wiggle\" along the edges.any object that blinks, twinkles, or shimmers is most likely a star. however, it could also be an aircraft if it is moving quickly across the night sky.; , celestial objects are not fixed in the night sky. all celestial bodies move, but how those bodies move can be a good indication of whether they're stars or planets.planets rise in the east and set in the west. they tend to follow a similar celestial path across our sky as the sun and moon. stars move around in the night sky, but they do not rise or set. instead, they orbit in a circular pattern around polaris (the north star). if the celestial object you see appears to move in a more-or-less straight line across the night sky, it is most likely a planet. satellites also move across the night sky, but they do so much more quickly than planets. a planet may take hours or even weeks to cross the night sky, whereas a satellite can cross overhead in a matter of minutes. , planets are always found along an imaginary belt across the night sky called the ecliptic. this belt is not actually a visible object, but careful observation will help you find the location where celestial objects are congregated. while stars may also appear along this invisible belt, they should be distinguishable by their shimmering appearance.of the celestial bodies along the ecliptic, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, and saturn are significantly brighter than the surrounding stars. this is due to their proximity to the sun since their \"brightness\" is just reflected sunlight. the easiest way to find the ecliptic is to note the location and trajectory of the sun and moon in the sky relative to your location on the earth. the sun's path across our sky is very close to the path of planets along the ecliptic., not all planets are colorful. however, many of the most prominent planets in our night sky appear to have some type of coloration. this can help differentiate the planets from stars. while some people with exceptionally good vision may be able to detect subtle coloration, that coloration usually falls within the blueish white to yellowish white range.for most people, stars appear white to the naked eye.mercury is typically gray or somewhat brownish in color.venus appears pale yellow. mars usually appears somewhere between pale pink and bright red. this is affected by the relative brightness or dimness of mars, which changes on a two-year cycle.jupiter appears orange with white bands.", "this will provide you with important basic information you will need to write your ccot essay, such as the date range and area(s) of the world that your essay should take into consideration. the prompt will also suggest whether you will be analyzing the continuities and changes over time for a place, theme, or specific topic.for example, a prompt might ask you to “evaluate the extent of continuity and change in the lives of european immigrants in the united states between 1876 and 1918.\"; , a thesis statement is the basic summation of your essay’s argument. for a ccot essay, it must refer to both a continuity and change. starting by writing out your thesis (one sentence is usually fine) will make it easier to focus on your argument as you right, and not get sidetracked a thesis might look something like “while the united states maintained its position as a manufacturing superpower in the first five decades after wwii, over time its focus shifted from the production of traditional goods to the creation of innovative electronics.” your thesis must specifically mention the time period.be as direct as possible about the continuity and change over time. , unlike the dbq (document-based question) on the ap exam, you won’t be provided any sources to draw on when writing the ccot essay. this means that you’ll have to rely on your own knowledge of world history.jot down the basic facts you know about the topic, as well as any key details that stick out in your mind. build your essay around these concrete details. for example, if your topic asks you to consider the development of manufacturing in the united states after wwii, start by writing down what you know about industries during that time period. if you know particular details about developments in the auto industry, you might work with those above all. , since the ccot essay stresses development, it should clearly identify what changes happened when. think of your essay as telling a story about history, and ask yourself: when was the climax during this time period?for instance, if you are writing about changes and continuities in manufacturing after wwii, you might argue that the vietnam war and the fuel crisis of the 1970s decisively changed the shape of american industries. create a timeline of events to sort out your historical information in order and help identify the turning point. , one of the quirks of the ccot essay is that though it asks you to focus on a particular location and time, it also requires you to think about what was going on in the rest of the world at the time. you shouldn’t go into great detail about other locations and topics, but you’ll want to indicate something about how other world events contributed to your topic. go ahead and start thinking about this as you plan your essay.continuing with the manufacturing example, your might keep in mind that the fuel crisis of the 1970s led to a rise in imported, fuel-efficient cars, which impacted the auto industry in", "depending on the theme of the party and the age and gender of the host, different gifts would be recommended. you'd get a 13-year-old girl something different than a 28-year-old man, of course. think of the purpose of party. are they getting married? is it for their graduation? think of these things and you may know already what to get. the present should be something they could use for the purpose of the event e.g. baby items for a baby shower. below are some sample ideas for different occasions. try a few of these or think of your own. mom's birthday/mother's day. try jewelry, a cookbook (if she likes cooking), a book she'd love to read, a movie you can watch together, or a poem you wrote about her. dad's birthday/father's day. get tickets to a sports game, a mug with a funny saying, a watch, or a scrapbook of your memories together. teenager's party. get gift cards to the movies, cd's/itunes gift cards, a journal, a t-shirt, or a movie. gift for a young child. get a stuffed animal, an easy book, bubble blowers, crayons/markers, toy trucks, or barbies (or other toys).

bibs, soaps, nursery lamp, or baby powder. wedding. get cookware, a frame, a platter, ornaments, a wedding canvas, pillowcases, or a vase. , this step could be the hardest part, but is possibly the most important. you'd want to get them something that is useful and something they like, right? think of their interests. are they into soccer? art? reading? ask another person on what they are into. ask their sibling, parent, or a friend of them to give some ideas without giving away the secret. or, simply ask them if they have a wish list, either on a website, or a verbal one. just ask for some ideas or ask what they like, but you can keep it a surprise if you want. are they always saying, \"i could really use a _________\", or \"i can't believe i lost/broke my ________.\" there's a gift idea! , always set a budget. once you start to get some gift options, make sure you aren't paying too much or too little. the gift doesn't have to be expensive. it's the thought that counts. on the other hand, you shouldn't be paying too little. if you're low on cash, just get a 15 or 20 dollar gift card to a place they like. look online for great deals. but, avoid the dollar store. that's a little cheap to go there for a gift, but it may give you ideas for one. think of the item. should i be paying $30 for a t-shirt?. no. what about $15?. better. just use your brain. , this has 2 positive reasons: if you're low on cash, you don't have to worry about spending a fortune, and it shows how", "because they started as a utilitarian piece for servicemen strapped with equipment,

"once you have lowered your flag and properly folded it, you will want to find a private place to dispose of the flag. the preferred method of disposal is to burn your flag in a large fire. make sure that it is big enough to properly destroy the flag, but not so large that it is a safety hazard.once the flag is destroyed, bury the ashes. be sure to check with local burn bans before you dispose of your flag. because many modern flags are treated with chemicals that can burn explosively and give off toxic fumes, burning your flag may cause an accident. , if you are unable or do not wish to burn your flag, you can also cut it into pieces. once a flag has been cut up, it is no longer an official u.s. flag and can be disposed of in various methods. when cutting up the flag, you will want to ensure that you do not cut into the blue star field. this section should remain whole, but you can cut the rest of the flag as you see fit. once the flag is properly cut up, you can dispose of it however you want.use scissors or a knife to cut the flag. avoid tearing the flag. this can be considered disrespectful. the blue star field represents the unity of the u.s. states, and cutting into that section is considered a symbolic attempt to disrupt that unity. some may consider this method less ceremonial or disrespectful. use your discretion, or talk to someone with experience disposing of flags, before you cut up a flag. , once a flag is worn, you can fold it up, place it in a box and bury it. as long as you are respectful about how you bury the flag, this is a good alternative to burning. be sure to place the flag in a box. letting the soil touch the flag is considered disrespectful, even if you disposing of a flag.this method could also be considered disrespectful or improper. considering that flags are coated in various chemicals to preserve them, this might be a less environmentally friendly option. unlike flags made from natural fibers like cotton that

scouts, and the boy scouts will take your old flags and properly dispose of them. the old flags are typically burned during disposal ceremonies, which are held at different times throughout the year. if you are unsure about the best method of disposing of your u.s. flag, this may be a good option.the american legion holds a flag disposal ceremony on flag day each year., if you are concerned about limiting your flag’s environmental impact, you might want to consider sending it to a company that specializes in recycling old flags. they will ensure that the flag is disposed of in an environmentally conscious way. the company may also use materials from", "small businesses may not have the money to install the same types of security systems that big business does. that does not mean they can leave the information they have stored on their computer systems unsecured and unprotected. instead, it means they need to be smarter about how they manage their computer security systems. they need to follow steps that will keep the information they have stored as safe as their clients, customers, and employees expect.; , small businesses face the same risks that big businesses face when it comes to cyber security. their computer systems can be infected with viruses and malware that slow down their computers. their systems can also be breached by hackers who are searching for private information that a small business may keep. depending on the type of business, the amount of private information about clients and customers can be extensive. addresses, email addresses, and other information about customers and clients. credit card information used for purchases. sensitive private identification numbers such as social security numbers and tax identification numbers. (this is especially common in small healthcare businesses.) , if a small business does not protect information entrusted to them, they can easily lose trust, revenue and could face fines and sanctions. , each should have antivirus software that is up to date and is turned on. this is the most basic protection and is essential. , the amount of security needed depends on the sensitivity of the information stored on the computer. extra security should be in place for more sensitive information. , this is a fairly new product which can help a company overcome financial difficulties if their computer systems are breached. , it is important to not only monitor employees to make sure they are not putting computers at risk, it is also important to monitor any private devices that an employee may use on the business network. , every business should have policies in place to protect their computer systems. the employees should all sign a form indicating they have read the policies and there should be consequences when employees break those policies. , the biggest reason a small businesses will use for not doing anything about cyber security is the cost. the reality is that the cost of a cyber security system for a small business does not have to be prohibitive. the cost of an anti-virus program, for instance, is not as large some businesses may think. many of the other steps to improve cyber security don’t cost much at all--if anything. , the cost of having a computer system breached is often much higher than the cost to secure it. globally, the cost of breaches in cyber security for all businesses could reach $3 trillion. each instance can result in lost productivity, lost data that has to be recreated and lost revenue. , not everyone will agree about the type of cyber security, or even how much security a small business needs. one thing they can agree on is that the threats to all computers are real no matter what", "like most people, you probably feel the

need to be with people that you trust enough to be emotionally vulnerable with. this step also means valuing experiences over things. things just fill up your house, while experiences make you feel alive and invigorated. , part of what makes life enjoyable is the experiences you have, from eating a fabulous dinner to watching a sunrise to taking a painting class. when life gets busy, you're likely to find excuses not to have new experiences, as everyone does. but making sure you take the time to get out and try new things is integral to making you an extraordinary person.think of it this way. when you think of extraordinary people, do you think of someone who sits at home every night? no, extraordinary people have extraordinary and interesting experiences. start making plans. decide you're going to try at least one new thing a week, and stick to it. making plans with other people can help you stick to it. also, don't be afraid to be spontaneous. feel like going to the beach? take

experiences you have, your passions help make your life fuller and you a more interesting person. following your passions helps engage your curiosity and keep your spark of life alive.maybe you've lost touch with your love of painting, but it used to make you happy. try picking it up again. join a club in your area, or find a class at your local community college. if you're not sure what you're really passionate about, start exploring interests. check out books from the library on hobbies and ideas that catch your attention, or start taking community college classes that catch your interest.

take practice. you can watch emotional movies or tv shows if you want to practice holding back your emotions. try episodes of wwyd on youtube.; , when something happens that brings out an emotional response in you, physically react as little as possible. keep your facial expressions in check and don't cry or get visibly angry. try thinking about something else, if you can. if you struggle with

thinking or feeling, or say anything that might give it away. , in general, speak as little as possible. this will give you a more stoic appearance, but it will also help you practice for times when you're trying to minimize your emotional response. , much like responding to questions as little as possible, you shouldn't just tell people things about yourself, your thoughts, or your feelings. , complaining is a sure sign of a lot of internal emotions, like anger and sadness, so avoid it. instead of complaining about things that bother you, take the situation into your own hands and fix the problem yourself. , bottling emotions and not dealing with them, as the above methods can lead to, is very unhealthy. make sure you find a healthy way to express your emotions later, in private. this can be yelling or crying into a pillow, writing your feelings and thoughts in a journal, or whatever else you find works for you. , the idea behind stoicism is that our negative emotions can lead us to make bad decisions and generally make our life worse. since emotions are often illogical responses, stoicism seeks to solve emotional problems by applying logic to the situation. try to apply logic to the situations in your daily life to practice for when you find yourself in emotional situations. , you may think that living a certain way or doing certain things is less than another way of living, and thinking that way can lead to lots of negative emotions, when things don't go your way or people disagree with you. consider your biases and think about other ways of looking at those situations. this will make it easier to cope with problems. , the goal of stoicism is not to minimize all emotion but instead to minimize negative emotions. this philosophy seeks to make you happier in your life by reducing the impact of emotions like sadness, anger, fear, and envy. doing this should be your main goal as a budding stoic. , while minimizing your experience of negative emotions, you should practice allowing and encouraging yourself to be happy. getting depressed or banishing happy thoughts can become almost a habit for some people, and breaking that habit should be another

entering puberty. knowing that age matters ahead of time can save you from trouble and potential heartbreak in the future. in high school, there’s generally more division of social groups based on grades as well. understand that the activities seniors engage in may be very different from what you are used to. for example, it’s common for seniors to go out and party more than freshmen. don’t engage in any dangerous or illegal activities just to spend time around your crush.; , sexual acts between a minor and someone who is legally an adult (18+) is called statutory rape. the age of consent varies from state to state but generally charges can be brought against an 18 year old if they are caught in a compromising situation with a minor so be safe and don’t break the law.understand that this is one major drawback of dating an older person in high school. if they start pressuring you to engage in sexual acts that you are not ready for, stay true to yourself and don’t cave. if they do not respect your boundaries, it’s time to end the relationship. , in terms of expectations and daily life, being a senior can be pretty different from being a freshman. after all, seniors are in their last year of high school and therefore have to prepare for the future. oftentimes, this means that seniors are busier with college applications, job searches, testing, socializing, and more. be prepared for and accepting of these and any other grade-related differences.not only are there differences in terms of workload and social groups, but freshmen and seniors also differ in terms of maturity, both physical and psychological. because of this, it may be inadvisable to get into a relationship with someone who is much older than you unless you are both sure that you’re at a similar level in terms of emotional and psychological maturity, which will lead to the two of you making safe, healthy decisions., don’t push your boundaries or let anyone else cross them. always be sure to firmly establish what the boundaries are in your relationship (should you end up in one). otherwise, you may find yourself in an uncomfortable situation.these boundaries are not only physical but also mental and emotional. decide what you want out of a relationship beforehand and don’t stay with someone who doesn’t respect the boundaries that you have decided on. for example, if you end up going to parties where seniors are drinking or doing drugs, don’t feel pressured to join in. and if your crush (or anyone else for that matter) pushes you to do things you’re uncomfortable with, that’s a clear sign to walk away. one in three adolescents in the united states is a victim of physical, sexual, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner.keep yourself safe by watching for warning signs,

that meets your needs.oftentimes, organizations plan craft fairs to raise money. if you want your money to go to a worthwhile cause, see if local charities, churches, and schools are planning any craft fairs. you should also look online and in the newspaper. try to find craft fairs catered specifically to your needs. some craft fairs may, for example, be selling items specifically for young children. this can be great if you have kids.; , as with any other shopping trip, a list is important. this will keep you focused and prevent overspending. if you have some idea what you want to get for various family members, jot down a list and take it with you to the craft fair.you may not know exactly what you're getting someone, and you won't always what precise items will be offered at a craft fair. however, you can write down a general idea. for example, if your mom loves decorative soaps, you can write down \"soap/bathroom items\" near her name. if you want to let the craft fair inspire you, simply write down the name of everyone who needs a gift. you can then try to find a gift that suits everyone on your list when you get to the fair. , this can be a great way to prevent overspending. you don't want to go into a craft fair spending too much money, so have a sense of how much you can reasonably spend.write down your income for the month. add up any necessary expenses, like bills, rent, and groceries, and then subtract this from your total income. this is your spending money for the month. think about how much of your spending money you can reasonably put towards the craft fair. maybe you can put around $200 towards christmas presents this year. try to break down your budget from there. if you're buying gifts for five people, for example, a $200 budget would allow you to spend roughly $40 per person. , most vendors at craft fairs will not be able to accept credit and debit cards. in addition to this, cash can prevent you from overspending. if you take out exactly how much money you budgeted to spend, you can easily keep track of your spending. this will prevent you from overspending at a holiday craft fair.make sure to store your cash safely in your wallet or purse. you do not want your money to get lost or stolen at the fair. , the fact is, some people are simply easier to shop for than others. casual acquaintances like co-workers, for example,

hand signals, body language, and facial expressions off of other directors is the best way to understand the kinds of signals to which experienced singers are already accustomed to.watch videos of other choir directors online. watch live performances of professional choirs and focus on what the director does and how the singers respond to each signal. go to live choir performances and watch the director. be sure you choose a seat that enables a clear view of the director. take notes about what seems to work especially well. sit in on a choir rehearsal and watch the director from the singers’ points of view.; , writing down the signals that you plan to use will lead to more consistency when used. , most signals must be exaggerated for your singers to see them clearly—particularly with a large choir or with children. however, try not to exaggerate so much that the audience would be distracted by your movements. , direct in front of a mirror or videotape yourself directing and determine whether your signals are clear. , the more you practice using your directing body language, the more comfortable you will be doing it in front of an actual choir. play your favorite choral music and pretend that you are directing it. if you know another choir director, ask if you can “borrow” their (already trained) choir for a part of a rehearsal. then ask for feedback or tips from the singers or the choir director. , while holding auditions may lead to a more skilled choir, some choir directors choose to give all those interested an opportunity to participate. , if you decide to have auditions, be sure to do the following steps. if you do not plan to hold auditions, you can skip ahead to the next part. secure a time and place for your auditions. for consistency it may be best to hold auditions in the room you in which you will be rehearsing or performing. advertise your auditions. think about the types of singers you wish to recruit and plan your advertising accordingly. you may want to start advertising several weeks to a month before the auditions will take place. decide whether to have singers prepare their own piece of music for the audition or sight-read on the spot. this information should be included in the advertisement. , listening to each vocalist sing and taking thorough notes about their performance will help you in your selection process. evaluate the vocal ability of each singer by noting the range and quality of each voice. you may want to develop a short questionnaire for singers to disclose experience, describe vocal range, ability to read

reach adult size very quickly, so it is recommended to have your pups in a cage that is an adequate size for an adult guinea pig. the cage should be at least 7.5 square feet. if you purchased pups from the pet store, make sure that the cage is large enough before you leave the store.even though the cage may seem a bit big for your pups, they will appreciate the extra space they will have to run and explore their environment. if you have a mother guinea pig in a cage with her babies, the cage should be large enough (minimum of 8 square feet) to accommodate all of them through the nursing stage.if your current cage is not large enough, visit your local pet store for assistance in selecting the right size cage.; , the majority of guinea pig cages are built for adult guinea pigs.for example, there is usually one-inch spacing between the bars on a guinea pig cage. your pups could possibly be small enough to squeeze through this spacing. to prevent them from doing this, consider purchasing a cage that has a deeper pan at the bottom. the deeper pan would be more difficult for your pups to climb out of.as an alternative to buying a new cage, you can purchase grids with smaller spacing at your local pet store. secure the grids on the outside of the cage with cable ties., the water bottle should be positioned low enough so that your pups can comfortably reach and sip from the bottle’s sipper tube.you may need to reposition the water bottle several times before it’s at just the right height for them. these water bottles can be purchased at your local pet store. the lowered water bottle may too low for your pups' mom. if you see that she is struggling to sip from the water bottle, it may be helpful to place a second water bottle at a higher height for her. , this is important whether you are bringing home pups or caring for the ones that your female guinea pig has given birth to. guinea pigs can be very sensitive to noise,so your pups will need to stay in a quiet area during their first few weeks of life. the cage should also be out of the path of direct sunlight and placed away from vents that could constantly blow air on the cage.it is ideal for the cage to be placed at approximately waist-level. this can make it easier to clean., pups should be held as early and often as possible so that they can become comfortable with human interaction. the more comfortable they are with people, the better socialized they will be, making them better pets. the mother guinea pig will not reject her babies if you hold them, but she will need time to complete the birthing process before they are ready to be held.female guinea pigs typically give birth to an average of three pups per litter. the birthing process usually takes about 30 minutes, with about three", "generally, the more time and money that is invested into the creation and publishing of the material, the more likely you are to find reliable information. a poorly designed website or pamphlet, or a site that is covered in unsightly advertisements and pop-ups, is not likely to provide information from an individual or organization invested in preserving their reputation or image. look for high-end, professional finishes to websites and print publications. note that this does not mean that all information found in well-packaged sources is credible. templates for well-designed websites are inexpensive and easily available. , a source is more credible if written by someone with a degree or other credentials in the subject of interest. if no author or organization is named, the source should not be considered highly credible. however, if the author is presenting original work, evaluate the merit of the ideas, not the credentials. credentials have never guaranteed innovation and the history of science tells us that the big advances in sciences tend to come from outsiders, not the establishment. some questions that you should ask about the author are:where does the author work? if the author is affiliated with a reputable institution or organization, what are its values and goals? do they benefit financially by promoting a particular view? what is his or her educational background? what other works has the author published? what experience does the author have? is s/he an innovator, or a follower and promoter of the status quo? has this author been cited as a source by other scholars or experts in the field? in the case of an anonymous author, you can check who published the website with http://whois.domaintools.com. it will tell you who registered the domain name and when, how many other domains they have, an email address to reach the person or organization as well as the mailing address. , find out when the source was published or revised. in some subject areas, such as the sciences, having current sources is essential; but in other fields, like the humanities, including older material is critical. it's also possible that you're looking at an older version of the source, and an updated one has since been published. check with a scholarly database for academic sources (or an online bookstore for popular sources) to see if a more recent version is available. if so, not only should you find it, but you can also feel more confident about the source — the more printings or editions, the more reliable the information. , the institution housing the information can often tell you a great deal about how credible that information is. for example, you should feel more comfortable trusting information found in the new york times or the washington post — two newspapers with proven track records of journalistic integrity and public retraction of errors — than that found in a source like infowars, which has a wide readership, but often publishes misleading or blatantly incorrect information., scan the document in question for tone, depth, and breadth before absorbing the information in it. are", "the plaintiff will begin the lawsuit by filing a complaint in court. in the complaint, the plaintiff will allege the protected characteristic you discriminated against, as well as the credit transaction in which you discriminated. you should read the complaint closely. also pay attention to the summons, which should come with the complaint. the summons will tell you when you must respond to the lawsuit.; , you should read the complaint in particular to discover what protected characteristic the plaintiff claims you discriminated against. consumers are protected from discrimination based on the following protected characteristics:race or color national origin religion disability (home loans only) age (not applicable to home loans) sex or marital status receipt of public assistance income (not applicable to home loans) exercising rights in good faith under the consumer credit protection act , also read the complaint to see what transaction the plaintiff claims he or she was the basis of the discrimination. for example, consumers can claim to have been discriminated against in the following ways:you refused credit or a home loan to someone who qualified you discouraged someone from applying for credit you offered credit on less favorable terms, such as a higher interest rate, than to someone with similar qualifications you closed someone’s account or treated them unfairly in collections upon default or in loan servicing , as soon as you receive the complaint, you should contact a lawyer. if you work in a large company (like a bank or mortgage company), then you should have general counsel on the payroll. if you work for a smaller business, you may already have an attorney on retainer. ask a supervisor for the name of your lawyer. if your business does not have a lawyer, then you will need to find one. you should ask other creditors in your area who their attorney is and if they would recommend the lawyer or law firm. if you have no leads, then you can contact any industry organizations that you belong to and seek a referral. , you should find all documents that relate to the discrimination claim. for example, if the plaintiff claims you discriminated during a loan application process, then you would want to gather all information that relates to the application: the application itself, any notes made during the interview, email communications about the consumer, etc. find all documents and put them in some sort of logical order to show to your attorney. also gather examples of company policies. a discrimination lawsuit will turn on your actions. since you are unlikely to admit at trial that you illegally discriminated against someone, discrimination will have to be based on your conduct. if you deviated from your company’s policies, then there is some proof that you might have been motivated by a discriminatory purpose. , your lawyer will review the information in order to come up with defenses. the specific defenses you raise will depend on the unique circumstances of your case. typically, however, you will argue that the adverse credit action was taken for non-discriminatory reasons. for example,", "once a strawberry has started to decay or turn mushy, freezing won't save it. the ripe, bright red strawberries will preserve best.moldy or mushy strawberries should be discarded in the compost, garden, or trash. , most strawberries are sold with a green cap where the stem was attached, or with a small stem segment. cut these off before freezing. , you can freeze strawberries whole, but if you intend to use them in recipes or as toppings you may wish to chop, slice, crush, or puree them first. once frozen and thawed, they will be more difficult to cut, although pureeing always remains an option. larger strawberries may also freeze and thaw more evenly if you cut them into smaller pieces first.if you're not sure how you want to prepare your strawberries, look at a few recipes first. pureed strawberries work well in slushies or smoothies, while sliced ones go well as toppings on cakes or waffles. whole strawberries can be dipped in chocolate. , packing strawberries in sugar or sugar syrup will preserve more flavor and texture, but not everyone enjoys the extreme sweetness that can result.if you do decide to go this route, use 3/4 cup (180 ml) sugar for each 1 quart (1 l) berries, regardless of how they are prepared. alternatively, create a heavy sugar syrup by mixing equal parts sugar and lukewarm water, then chill in the refrigerator and use it to cover the berries completely.while it may make more sense to add sugar or syrup after packing the strawberries, decide whether to use it or not before you begin packing, so you know whether to leave additional space in the containers. , this is a good option if you prefer an unsweetened strawberry, but you want to preserve the flavor and texture better than a \"dry pack\" with no additional ingredients would. this requires purchasing powdered pectin, and boiling it in water. different brands may require different amounts of water per packet. let the pectin syrup cool before covering the strawberries. note that this may not preserve it as well as the sugar or sugar syrup. , thick, rigid glass and plastic containers typically work best, but make sure they are freezer-safe before using. freezer-safe plastic zip lock bags are another option. pack the strawberries loosely to prevent them forming one large mass. it's generally a good idea to leave 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25–2 cm) of space at the top of the container to allow for expansion while freezing. if the strawberries are packed \"dry,\" without any sugar or syrups, you may wish to spread them loosely on a tray and freeze them for a few hours on the tray. then transfer to a more compact container as described. this makes it easier to remove individual strawberries instead of a large, icy lump. , remove the strawberries and let thaw in the refrigerator for several hours before using. if you wish to speed up this process, put the strawberries under cold running water. heating in a microwave or by another method may cause the strawberries", "on irs.gov, you can find numerous resources regarding how to apply for an ein by simply typing \"ein\" in the keyword search box on the home page. before you begin the application process, confirm a new ein is necessary and find out what information will be required to complete the application.generally, as executor of the estate, you must get a new ein for a business that was run by the deceased person as a sole proprietorship. however, if the deceased person did not previously have an ein for the business, it may not be necessary for you to get one now. sole proprietorships are not considered distinct from the person for tax purposes, so it's possible that a sole proprietor simply used their own social security number for business dealings. for example, if the deceased person worked as a freelance graphic designer from their own home, they may have used their own social security number for contracts with clients rather than keeping the business separate. as a general rule, if there was an ein for the business while the person was alive, you need a new one to properly deal with the business and its assets after the person's death.; , the online ein application is set up interview-style, where you are asked questions and supply the answers before moving on to the next item. this application format typically is easier and more straightforward than filling out the paper form.the online application is available monday through friday from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. eastern time. if you want, you do have the option of applying for an ein by completing form ss-4 and faxing or mailing it to the irs. however, this method is slightly more difficult and you'll have to wait for the new ein. you must provide information about the business – which you should be able to gather from the deceased person's records – as well as personal information about yourself as the responsible person for the new ein. , once you've submitted your application, you will immediately be issued the new ein for the business. while you have the option to download and save an electronic copy of the notice, you also should print a paper copy for the estate's records.keep the ein in a safe place as you will need to use it to update business records and information when you dissolve the business or distribute it according to the requirements of the will. while it may take a few days for the new ein to show up in the irs's taxpayer records, you should still be able to use it in the meantime for other tasks such as opening a bank account. , if the deceased person's business is mentioned in the will, you must follow the instructions there regarding what is to be done with the business. however, a sole proprietorship typically dies with the

define the shape of a polygon. statisticians use slope to describe the correlation between two variables.economists use slope to show and predict rates of change.people also use slope in real, concrete ways. for example, slope is used when constructing roads, stairs, ramps, and roofs.; , the term “run” refers to the horizontal distance between two points, or the change in x \\displaystyle x

\\displaystyle \\frac 2 1 . this means that to go from one point to the next, you need to go up 2 along the y-axis, and over 1 along the x-axis. , you can do this using the slope-intercept form of a line’s equation. the slope-intercept form says that y=mx+b \\displaystyle y=mx+b . in this formula, m \\displaystyle m equals the slope of the line. you can rearrange the equation of a line into this formula to find the slope.for example, in the equation y=3x+1 \\displaystyle y=3x+1 , the slope would be 3 \\displaystyle 3 . you can still think of this slope in terms of rise over run if you turn it into a fraction. any whole number can be turned into a fraction by placing it over 1. so, 3=31 \\displaystyle 3= \\frac 3 1 . this means that the line represented by this equation rises 3 units vertically for every 1 unit it runs horizontally. , the larger the slope, the steeper the line. a line is steeper the more vertical it rests on a coordinate plane.for example, a slope of 2 (that is, 21 \\displaystyle \\frac 2 1 ) is steeper than a slope of 0.5 (12 \\displaystyle \\frac 1 2 ). , a positive slope is one that moves up and to the right. in other words, in a positive slope, as x \\displaystyle x increases, y \\displaystyle y also increases. a positive slope is denoted by a positive number. , a negative slope is one that moves down and to the right. in other words, in a negative slope, as x \\displaystyle x increases, y \\displaystyle y decreases. a negative slope is denoted by a negative number, or a fraction with a negative numerator. to help remember the difference between a positive and negative slope, you can think of yourself as standing on the left endpoint of the line. if you need to walk up the line, it’s positive. if you need to walk down the line, it’s negative.knowing the difference between negative and positive slopes can help you check that your calculations are reasonable. , a horizontal line is a line that runs straight across a coordinate plane. the slope of a horizontal line is 0. this makes sense if you think", "this is the age-old alternative for a candlelit dinner on the town: change the venue to your own home. it can be

at selling soap, you must become an expert at making it, and refine the technique and formulae you want to use. there are two main methods for making soap, the hot process and the cold process.the cold process of making soap is the most common method. it involves mixing an alkali (usually lye) with fats or oils. once mixed and formed into shape, it can take weeks for the soap to cure. the hot process of making soap requires you to cook the soap. this method requires no cure time, and can make it easier to add scents and colors. however, it is more difficult to work with and mold hot

a full shop). as your soap making operation grows, you might purchase additional equipment, but to start out you will at least need:a blender a microwave molds a mixing kettle labelers wrappers , you’ll want to set yourself apart from the competition, and create a product that consumers really want. think about who you want to buy your soaps, and what kind of niche your products will fill.for example, you might create soaps that are entirely free of any animal by-products for those consumers who care about animal rights, or soaps that are made using only all-natural ingredients for consumers who care about “green” and healthy living.think about: creating a unique and memorable company nameusing specially designed shapes embossing the soap with letters or other forms wrapping the soap in special papers or ribbons creating a logo for your company , if you want to make soaps on a consistent scale, you will need a steady supply of oils, fats, scents, colors, wrappers, etc. you

poor service from a valet is because they are not paying attention to how the system works. valet drivers and doormen have 2 objectives, serve you while making a good impression, and moving cars in

and lost tips for the valet. you may be caught off guard by the rushed nature of the interaction between you and the valet, but this is not to be taken for rudeness. so pay attention to what other people are doing, and what the valets are asking of you. many times customers are being loaded and unloaded on the curb of a busy street. this requires a lot of focus and attention from the valet as well as the customer.; , drive slowly into the loading zone and stop behind the car in front of you. do not get out of your car until the valet opens your door. many times a valet will want you to pull forward or move to another position in the loading zone before you exit your vehicle. watch for direction from the valet. , it should be the valet's responsibility to open the doors for the female passengers first. however, sometimes time and circumstances do not permit this. make the judgment yourself about whether it is within the capability of the valet to perform this service. if there is a lot of traffic and only one or two valets, it may not be possible. when you exit the vehicle, listen carefully for instructions from the valet concerning price, closing time, and how to get your vehicle back. these details are very important. some valet services may close earlier than the restaurant and leave your car somewhere convenient for you to pick up. if you don't listen, you may have to leave your car overnight and pay an extra fee. , you do not need to include every detail of the vehicle's performance, but if a door only opens a certain way, or the alarm is finicky, most

it. generally, one or two valets run the stand while others retrieve cars. you can slow the process down by giving your ticket to the wrong person. once again, don't mistake the rushed atmosphere for rudeness. usually valets are under a lot more pressure when customers are leaving than when they are arriving. , when you see your car, quickly gather your party and get in. this is the most common time to tip the valet. valets usually pool their tips and divide them equally. usually it does not matter who you tip. if you are paying a fee, this usually goes to the doorman. , watch for other",

to and what's going on in their heads. so make sure you're supportive of your teen, and that you always seem approachable. don't judge them, and don't lecture them for making mistakes. mistakes are a huge part of life. \"live and learn,\" is a very popular quote for a reason. be supportive when they have made a mistake, and help them to see: the way out; the lesson in the mistake; how to avoid such mistakes in the future; the faulty thought process leading up to the poor choice; etc. , teens can't be perfect right now - they have a lot more to deal with than parents think. teen years are

the kids for a limited period of time so that you can enjoy your hobby., you can ask a family member to take care of the kids or you can get a babysitter to look after them if you can't do your hobby at home. getting a babysitter or someone to look after your kids is a way that you and your partner can enjoy your hobby together., if you don't already have a detailed schedule, you should write it down so that you have a better understanding of when you'd be able to partake in your hobby. for example, if you work 9-5 and have a babysitter until 7, it", "approach from the back of the deer's shoulders; away from hooves and head. using a long stick or piece of grass, touch it to the deer's open eye. if there is any reaction at all, a sound chest or neck shot will end things. if not mounting the head, a head shot would work also. , this will help it drain as you dress it. , roll up your sleeves and put on the gloves. , bucks especially have a stronger musk and if this gets into the meat it will make it more gamy. avoid touching the tarsal glands on the hind limbs of the deer (located at the ankles, they are a patch of longer fur and are often much darker in color), the object is to detach the anus and colon from the hide to prevent tearing and the soiling of meat by the deer's droppings. gently tug the anus and attached colon (intestines) a few inches back away from the deer's body. if desired, you can tie it in a knot at this point. , or, if you have a hunting partner with you, they can help by holding the leg up. , you can find it by feeling along the ribcage, to where it ends and forms a v shape at the base of the chest, just above where it meets the belly. , point the blade end of the knife toward the rear of the deer. , you should be able to feel the difference between the hide wall and the membrane/muscle wall that holds the innards inside. the goal in the next part is to cut through the hide and muscle wall only to prevent cutting of the organs and tainting of the meat. , when done properly there is no gore. , using care not to cut yourself or the guts, sever the attaching tissues. these tissues are stringy and attach the internal organs of the deer to its body and most are located along the spine. unless you have the misfortune to have gut-shot the deer you should still have little to no gore or mess. the guts will tend to stay together. , if the deer was heart/lung shot this is when you will need to be ready for gore; if necessary you may need to roll the deer onto its belly, and splay the limbs for a few minutes to let it drain. ,, some prefer to cut through the sternum to open the rib cage. some do not. if cutting through the rib cage it is pretty straightforward- simply sever the trachea as high up as possible, and the rest comes out. , be very careful-- broken bones/shoulders/ribs are sharp on a deer! feel your way up the trachea as far as you can, then using your other hand very carefully sever the trachea as far up as you can. the lungs and heart should pull free easily now. always use caution and care! do this step at home if you are not feeling comfortable with it in the field.", "your substitute may introduce themselves and explain why your normal teacher could not be there that day. the substitute may also choose to tell you a bit about themselves, or they may not. when they begin speaking at the beginning of class, give them your full and undivided attention. this means that you should put away anything you were working on for a different class. you should also put away any cell phones, laptops, tablets, or or other electronic devices that may take your attention away from the teacher.; , many substitute teachers will take attendance by calling out the name of each student at the beginning of class. this is because they don’t know the names of everyone and they want to see who is present and who is not. though some students may try to give the substitute a hard time by making jokes or telling them the wrong name, resist this temptation. giving them a hard time will only show them that they have to be very strict with you to keep you under control. when they say your name, simply say “here” and raise your hand so they can find you quickly and easily. if they go around the room asking everyone’s name then say your name clearly and loud enough for them to hear when it is your turn. , your teacher likely left behind an assignment for you to complete while they are away. if so, complete the assignment as instructed. if the substitute makes it clear that you are allowed to work with your neighbor on the assignment, then talk quietly. if you are not normally allowed to work together, don’t push the boundaries by trying to work together on the assignment when the substitute is there. if you need help with the assignment, take it up to the teacher and ask if they can help you with your question. understand that they may not be able to help you since they don’t normally teach the class. try to ask your question quietly so that you don’t embarrass them in front of the whole class if they don’t know the answer. , if your teacher has given you a free-day, then use the time to work on other assignments. if the substitute has said they don’t mind if you talk to one another, then feel free to do so, but keep it quiet. don’t take this as permission to go crazy. sometimes substitute teachers will put on a movie to watch. if you don’t want to watch the movie, you don’t have to, but don’t be disruptive to everyone else. work on another assignment, or do something quiet like drawing or journalling. , when the substitute gave you the assignment, they likely explained when you should hand it in. if they instructed you to hand it in as soon as you are finished then bring the assignment up to their desk as soon as you are finished. if they instructed you to hold on to the assignment until the end of class, then leave it", "use a knob lock with a doorknob cover.after you have installed a standard knob lock, you should install a doorknob cover so that your children cannot open it.this is a nice solution for the door between the interior of the house and the garage.; , a dutch door has two independent sections, so you can open the top part while keeping the bottom closed.you can open the top part to pass groceries from the garage to the house, while keeping the bottom locked so that your child doesn’t sneak out during this activity.if you are working in your garage and want to leave the door open to allow for some fresh air in the house, you can open the top part of the dutch door and still keep toddlers and pets safely in the house. you might also consider installing a dutch door at the front of your house. this will allow you to let in some sun and air while keeping your toddler off the street and out of the driveway and garage area., place a two by four under the garage door, press close and see if the garage door senses the block of wood. if the garage door senses the wood and reverses direction, it is working fine. if it closes on the block of wood, it will not be safe for children. in this case, you should replace your garage door opener.it is mandatory for garage doors to be equipped with an auto-reverse function and photoelectric sensors for safety reasons. the auto-reverse mechanism was introduced in 1982 and the photoelectric sensors were introduced in 1993.if your garage door was installed prior to 1993 or not updated, you may want to replace it. keep your garage door controls out of reach of children. install the garage door opener switch high enough so that small hands cannot reach it. if you have a mobile garage door opener, you should keep this away from your children.exercise caution, and make sure that your garage door is in working order if you have a manual garage door. keep children away from the moving parts of a garage door in order to avoid any crushing or pinching of hands. , it is tempting to drive away from your home without watching the garage door fully close. however, sometimes a small object gets in the way and the auto-reverse mechanism is engaged. in this case, you will be leaving the house with the door open and the garage accessible to your children.avoid storing things too closely to the garage door. if you store things too closely to the door, they may fall onto the door and interrupt its operation., once a month, you should take a quick look at your garage door to make sure it is operating smoothly. open and close it a couple of times to see if it is opening slower than usual or if there are any unusual creaks. look at the cables, springs, and pulleys to see if they look worn down.if there is something wrong with the door, you", "that's a highly unscientific approach that can lead to fighting and an unfair distribution of your wealth. there are three ways to set up a will: statutory wills: these are public forms that only require you to fill in blanks about who is getting what. because they are public, they are quickly accepted by courts of law, though not all states will have them.personal wills: you can write your own will, though you need to be very specific about what is going where to avoid complications. you will need 2 witnesses to sign as well. there is also software that can help you write the will.working with a lawyer: your safest bet when writing a will is to hire a lawyer. they can answer questions, help avoid pitfalls, and defend your intentions after you die. simple wills cost anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand dollars.; , the executor is the person in charge of your estate after you've died. that's the person who will likely be in full control of your assets. the executor needs to be named in your will and you should consider assigning an alternate in case your first choice is unable to help. talk to the person you have in mind before you die to make sure he or she is okay with the responsibility, then send the executor a sealed copy of the will when it is finished. spouses are most commonly named executors, as they are familiar with the estate. trusted friends and family members make good executors. if you do not name an executor one will be court appointed, which could lead to executor expenses for your family., to avoid dragging any minor children through the courts, it's best to name a guardian for minor children in the will. make sure you talk to the person first to make sure he or she is okay with the potential responsibilities of caring for you children. you should similarly account for any of your pets., the inventory should contain a list of all of your debts and assets, the approximate value of each, whether the assets will pass directly to a new owner, and a total debt and asset value. the list may need to be formal, delivered to the heirs in a specific form or manner, and/or filed with the court. check your state’s probate code or check with your attorney to determine if the inventory should be filed with the court and how it should be distributed to the heirs. for now, simply create the list so you know what needs to be distributed in your will. assets are anything that can be sold for money. debts are bills, loans, or expenses that need to be paid after your death. the value of real estate listed on the inventory should be the most recently appraised value. consult an attorney or a certified public accountant to determine if a formal appraisal is required in your state. personal property values listed on the inventory are calculated based on current market value by agreement of the", "you will need a mailing address or email address, as well as the name of the person who is ultimately in charge of what

or filleted, gefilte fish is made with a combination of various freshwater, white-meat fish. carp, whitefish, pike, grouper, cod, and halibut are used in various recipes. two parts whitefish and one part pike is a standard combination in many gefilte fish dishes.if you buy from a fishmonger, ask to keep the head, fins, and tail for use in cooking a more traditional fish stock. it’s okay to buy fillets and buy fish stock separately, as well. you also have the option to buy pre-made gefilte fish patties to use in your dish. if you choose to buy gefilte fish in a jar, you won’t need to do anything except heat it up. the amount of fish you need depends on how much gefilte fish you want to make. a relatively small batch requires two to three pounds of fish.; , if you are using freshly caught fish, or whole fish from a butcher or fishmonger, you’ll need to clean, gut, and fillet the fish. this can be a time consuming and messy process, so buying prepared fish is easier. , lay the fish on a cutting board and grab a paring knife. cut the fish across the width into slices that are ½ inch (1.27 cm) to one inch (2.54 cm) thick. you’ll use a blender or food process next, and it works best when you use small slices of fish rather than an entire fillet., while you continue preparing the gefilte fish patties, pour your fish stock into a saucepan to begin heating. once it boils, turn it to medium heat to simmer until the patties are ready to be cooked. use fish stock from the store or make your own from scratch.for added flavor, throw some onion, carrots, and celery into the stock while it boils. this is an option based on your personal preference. a good proportion is two large carrots, two sticks of celery, and half of an onion, all chopped. use a one or two quart (.9-1.9 l) saucepan filled half-full with fish stock. , depending on the size of your food processor and the amount of fish you are making, it’s best to not chop it all up at once. put about half of the fish into the food processor or blender, then repeat the following steps with the second half. since gefilte fish is generally made up of multiple types of fish, be sure to place some of each fish into the blender so it forms into a somewhat consistent mixture. , the chopping part of making gefilte fish can be tricky and isn’t an exact science. using the available settings, chop the fish so it is blended together and forms a ball. run the appliance in bursts for 10-30 seconds. once the fish is chopped, dump it into a mixing bowl.be careful not to blend the fish for so long that it becomes a paste. a mixture with some chunks of fish is better than a mushy mixture of fish. if your appliance has a blade that is designed for", "vodka sauce is traditionally served with penne or rigatoni pasta, though you can use it to top any type of pasta that you like. as you start to prepare the sauce, bring a pot of water to boil on the stove to cook your pasta.be careful not to overcook your pasta. test it a minute or two before the instructions say it will be done to see if the texture is right. it should be slightly firm when you taste it because it will continue to cook while you drain it and in the sauce. you don’t necessarily have to use vodka sauce on pasta. it can make a delicious sauce for pizza, chicken, and fish too.; , set a large skillet or saute pan on the stove, and set the burner to medium heat. add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil and 2 tablespoons (30 g) of butter, and heat until the butter is completely melted.while the combination of butter and olive oil offers the best flavor for the dish, you can use 4 tablespoons (120 g) of butter by itself or 4 tablespoons (120 ml) of olive oil by itself if you don’t have the other ingredient on hand. you can tell that the oil and butter are at the right temperature when the mixture goes from completely smooth to rippled in the pan. , when the butter and olive oil is properly heated, add 1 cup (approximately 1 medium onion or 150 g) finely chopped onion 2 to 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the pan. allow the garlic and onion to cook for approximately 5 minutes, or until the onion becomes soft and slightly brown.stir the onion and garlic as they cook to ensure that they’re well combined. watch the pan carefully to ensure that the onion and garlic don’t burn. , once the onion and garlic have cooked for several minutes, remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour in ¾ of cup (180 ml) of vodka before returning it to the stove. stir it into the onion and garlic, and allow the contents to cook for 2 to 3 minutes so the vodka can start to reduce.if you would like a sharper flavor to your sauce, you can add up to 1 cup (240 ml) of vodka. you may want to experiment to see what amount you like best. to reduce the risk of fire, don't pour the vodka directly from the bottle into the pan. instead, pour it in a measuring cup first and then add it to the pan from the cup. make sure to have a lid for your pan nearby when you add the vodka. if it ignites, immediately place the lid on the pan to smother and kill the flames. , when the vodka, onion, and garlic mixture has cooked for a few minutes, it’s time to add the tomato puree to the sauce. pour one can of puree, approximately 14 ounces (397 g), into the skillet, and stir until all of the contents are thoroughly combined. reduce the", "if you’ll be playing on a natural grass pitch where it doesn’t rain too regularly, you should use a pair of firm ground shoes. firm ground shoes usually have ten or more long studs that are distributed evenly throughout the bottom rim of the shoe. they provide a sufficient amount of traction for normal playing conditions. the studs can either be conical or blade shaped. conical studs are rounded at the bottom. they allow a player to have flexibility of motion. blade shaped studs become thinner at the bottom of the shoe. they’re designed to dig into the pitch and give a player better traction. however, they don’t offer quite as much flexibility as conical studs because it’s harder to remove them from the ground.firm ground shoes are the safest shoes to buy if you don’t know what type of field you’ll be playing on. they’re considered acceptable for many different playing conditions.; , if you’ll be playing on a pitch where it rains often you’ll need to wear a pair of soft ground cleats. the studs on a soft ground cleat are similar to those on a firm ground cleat. however, there is usually only about six of them and they are strategically placed so the shoe can offer maximum traction. the studs on a soft ground cleats can also be conical or blade shaped. on soft ground shoes, there will be two blades in the back of the shoe on either side of the heel and four blades positioned on the front of the shoe (two on either side about an inch from each other) to maintain balance. soft ground shoes should only be used on soft surfaces. wearing them in other conditions can lead to injury., hard ground shoes are designed to give players traction and balance on surfaces where much of the grass has been worn down leaving only the rigid ground beneath it. the bottom of a hard ground cleats is covered in small, flat studs. unlike those of firm ground and soft ground cleats, the studs on a hard ground cleat are spread out over the entire bottom of the shoe. hard ground cleats are not designed to dig into the ground. rather, they offer grip to help a player balance on a solid surface. their names may sound similar, but hard ground shoes are not appropriate for firm ground pitches. , many soccer leagues are starting to play on turf. it’s easy and cheap to maintain and it stays the same in almost every kind of weather. if turf cleats have studs at all, they’ll be very tiny and spread out over the entire bottom of the shoe. rather than studs, they may simply have a slightly elevated pattern on the bottom that allows them to offer traction on the turf.don’t wear turf cleats on any other surface than turf. they don’t have studs long or sharp enough to grip different surfaces. , if you’re a forward, your main concern on the pitch is to score goals. you’ll need a shoe with a clean strike", "mbox uses a single file format to store e-mails, so it is possible for the file to get over-sized due to the number of mails. even one bulky e-mail could significantly increase the size of the entire file, or a problem with a single email could make the entire database corrupt or unusable.; , the issues related to mbox are most prominent while importing mbox files into apple mail. some of the most common errors while importing mbox files into apple mail are as follows: \"some messages could not be imported; the partially imported mailboxes are located in the mailbox named \"import\" in the mailboxes list.\" \"your mail index has been corrupted\". this message usually appears after updating to mavericks os. you might face a situation where mail messages suddenly go blank. , there are several means to tackle such errors. depending upon the severity of the error, there are different types of fixes, ranging from a simple rebuild to complex recovery operations. the total time taken to fix such issues depends solely upon the level of damage and the number of email messages with the folder. , this is the simplest solution to get rid of any unwanted files clustered in the mailbox folders. you can also use this option to rebuild a mailbox to update the list of messages it has. for example, in case of missing or garbled messages you can use this option. in order to rebuild the mailbox: open the apple mail e-mail client. select the folders to be rebuilt click mailbox - rebuild note: locally stored messages and attachments are discarded, when you rebuild mailboxes for imap and exchange accounts. in addition, the messages and attachments are downloaded again from the server to your mac. however, your mailbox appears empty until the download is complete. , this is the most crucial process, as removal of wrong files can add to your woes. this process recreates the .plist file to show up the email messages. however, it does not guarantee certainty of resolution. in order to restore the preferences: navigate to the following directory if you are working on any os above 10.7 (os x 10.7+)* :~/library/containers/com.apple.mail/data/library/preferences. however, for os x (10.4-10.6), the proper directory is ~/library/preferences. drag the file: com.apple.mail.plist to the desktop. the application will allow creating a new preference file once you re-open apple mail. , mbox files use a very simple and robust format to keep emails and can be easily imported on any other platform. you can use the exporting or archiving feature to export the mails from mac os x. exporting or archiving allows you to move data to a user-specified location. this frees up the space and allows you to access mails anytime in future. it is advised to keep the folders together while exporting; however, you can select multiple folders to export. in order to export the mailboxes: locate the mailbox

online search engines as you can and type in your full name; you may be surprised by what pops up. click on links that are related to you, and scroll through the images that are linked to your name. if you find something that paints a less than flattering picture of you, consider refining your privacy settings on your accounts so that the item you do not want displayed will be hidden.; , look at each of your online media profiles. scroll through and try to use an outsider’s perspective to consider what someone looking at your profile might see. use your profile to show off your interests; ‘like’ pages that reflect your (reputable) interests. put up photos of you pursuing those interests, such as hiking tall mountains, playing a sport, or writing. , part of making sure that your profile highlights your strengths involves getting rid of things that could highlight your weaknesses. set up filter and privacy settings so that you have to approve anything that gets posted to your account, including articles, photos, and statuses. stay updated on the privacy settings. check the settings every month to make sure that some upgrade hasn’t left you (or your embarrassing photos) exposed. delete (or untag) any photos or posts of you that you think could reflect poorly on your character. if possible, ask the person who posted the photo to take it down entirely so that it won’t exist anywhere on the internet. , there is a good chance that there is someone else in the world who has the same name as you. if your potential employer searches your name and ends up on someone else’s page, it could lead to a lot of confusion (and a lowered chance that you get the job). to minimize confusion, try to set up a specific url that is registered to your name for your online profile. , social networking sites can be a veritable war zone when it comes to controversial topics. while it is perfectly fine to voice your opinions, you may want to consider doing so in person, rather than online. try to limit the amount of debates or virtual fights you get into, and always try to be as respectful as possible. you wouldn’t want a potential employer to see a post where you call someone a nasty name for having a different opinion than you. if you do feel the need to post something that could potentially spark debate, or make your potential employer see you in a certain light, try to only post these things to your friends. however, do keep in mind that things can go viral in minutes, and there are always chances that someone will re-tweet or tag you, allowing more people access to the post. , while it is fine to ‘friend’ your coworkers, keep in mind that they are still working for your boss; if they see something that they think your boss should know about, they have the ability to tell him or her. employers also have", "almost everybody enjoys receiving compliments. giving your girlfriend a compliment lets her know what you admire and love about her. when giving her a compliment, try to make it as specific as possible. think about what is unique about her. a specific compliment will be remembered longer and appreciated more than a general compliment that could be given to anyone.say things like “i really like the outfit you have put together today,” or “i’m really impressed by your taste in books.” think about something you haven’t complimented her on before. maybe she does a great job of handling all of her responsibilities. if she has gotten her hair done recently, notice it and compliment it. you don’t have to constantly compliment her. too many compliments can seem insincere after a while. if your girlfriend is insecure about certain things, like her body or looks, compliment her to raise her confidence about them.; , talking about your emotions can be difficult to do, but it will almost always be appreciated. expressing your emotions about the relationship will vary depending on the type of relationship and how long you have been together. tell her that you love her, appreciate what she does, and value her in your life. let her know how she has made you better as a person.if is a fairly new relationship, you can say “i’m so happy i’ve been able to get to know you. i hope i can get to know you even more as our relationship progresses.” it never hurts to let your girlfriend know how much you appreciate having her in her life, even if it is an established relationship. , making the effort to include your girlfriend in your plans and daily life means a lot. you don’t have to fully include her into every part of your life if it is a new relationship. choose what you include her in based on what you are comfortable with and how serious the relationship is. if it is a new relationship, ask her to hang out with your friends during the weekend. if you are more serious, bring her to family functions or on a trip.what you include her in doesn’t have to be that important or serious. it is just as nice to invite her to run errands with her. letting her know you think of her and want her around is what counts. , remembering the small things sometimes means just as much as remembering the big things. this is because it is surprising and shows how much you pay attention to her, her life, and your relationship. pay attention to the small events and remarks, like something she says she likes or doesn’t like, a childhood memory that means a lot to her, or remember the details about how you met her.you can also remember her favorite movies, songs, books, and/or plays and watch or read them with her later. remember the details about the relationship. for example, remember where you first held hands, first kissed, or a favor she did for you that", "training your dog is the best way to teach him good manners. when your dog is well trained, he will understand how he should to relate to you and other household members (his ‘pack’). you can train your dog to do many things, such as sit, stay, and come when called. other forms of training include leash training and crate training. keep in mind that training your dog is not about showing him that you are dominant to him in the pack. in fact, interacting with your dog from a position of dominance could actually weaken your bond with him and increase his stress and anxiety.obedience classes are a great way to train your dog. training your dog will require your time and patience. it may take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to train him.; , in addition to formal training, creating a clear set of rules for your dog will help him understand how he should relate to his pack. the rules you set are up to you and should reflect how you want your dog to behave in your home.for example, you can establish a rule that your dog cannot sit on the furniture. you can also set rules about where your dog can sleep (on the floor rather than on your bed),and how he should wait to be fed (sitting instead of jumping up and down). as with formal training, these rules will teach your dog how to be a well-behaved member of the pack. the better your dog understands the rules of the house, the less anxious he will be, and the less likely he will develop behavior problems., reinforcing the rules is key to helping your dog understand how he is supposed to behave. positive reinforcement (e.g., verbal praise, treats, extra playtime) is an effective way to reinforce the rules by rewarding only good behavior. your dog will recognize that good behavior brings rewards, and will thus perform the behaviors for which he will be rewarded.positive reinforcement should be immediate when your dog performs the desired behavior (e.g., sitting before he eats). immediate reinforcement will help your dog establish an association between good behavior and reward.positive reinforcement should also be consistent. the more consistent the reward, the better your dog will understand how to behave., rewarding your dog for following the rules is one side of the coin—making the breaking of the rules undesirable is the other side. one way to create an undesirable consequence is to ignore your dog when he misbehaves. because your dog does not want to be ignored,he will choose to follow the rules and get your attention, rather than break the rules and risk being ignored. deterrent devices, such as upside-down mousetraps and motion-activated bottles of compressed air,are available that will discourage the bad behavior without hurting your dog. a firm ‘no’ is often effective. do not reinforce the rules through physical or verbal abuse. this will likely instill fear in your dog, rather than teach him good behavior., consistency is key to teaching your dog how to", "the clothing for this costume must be all black. the black clothing will give the allusion that there’s nothing behind the glow sticks (creating the appearance of a genuine stick figure), and the glow sticks will appear to glow brighter with the contrasting black background. lay the top and bottoms on a flat surface such as a floor or table.the type of clothing used for the costume can be anything black, such as leggings, sweat pants, hoodies, turtlenecks, etc.; , on a sheet of paper, draw a couple different styles of stick figures to brainstorm what kind a pattern you want to create for your costume.stick figure patterns are relatively simple in nature, but by sketching out a rough plan for your costume, you’ll have a better idea on how to position the glow sticks and how many glow sticks you’ll need. err on the side of caution and get more glow sticks than you think you may need. aim for approximately 50 glow sticks for both the back and front of the costume. this will be beneficiary if any of the glow sticks break, don’t glow, or if you want to make more patterns. , while the costume clothing is laid flat, assemble the glow sticks on top of the clothing to make the stick figure pattern. generally, a straight line of glow sticks span from the neck area of the clothing, to the waist of the pants. then, glow sticks lead off on both the top and bottom ends of the middle section of sticks, to create the arms and legs of the stick figure. when your glow sticks are in the pattern you want for the costume, use clear packaging tape to secure the glow sticks to the clothing.stick the tape on the glow sticks lengthwise, so the entire glow stick is covered in tape. do not crack the glow sticks at this time. when the front of the costume is finished, turn the clothing over and tape glow sticks on to the back of the clothing.try to have all of the glow stick ends touching each other in the pattern. this arrangement will help make the stick figure look like it is made of one continuous line rather than a bunch of dashed lines. , if you decide to wear a black hoodie for the top portion of the costume, consider decorating the rim of the hood with glow sticks in order to make a “head” for the stick figure. if you aren’t wearing a hoodie or don’t want to assemble the glow sticks that way, use the plastic connector pieces of the glow sticks to create a circled necklace of sticks. then, consider taping the circle to your forehead, or using sturdy hair clips to attach the circle onto the hair on your head.remember, you want to make a head for the back of the costume too. if you’re wearing a hoodie, you can tape the top of the circle necklace to the back of the hood. if you aren’t wearing a hoodie, use clips to attach", "replace teaspoons of sugar added directly into your coffee with a low calorie or no-calorie sweetener, such as splenda. follow the directions on the package regarding serving size and resist the urge to add extra. you can also request this substitution when ordering at a coffee shop.it is best to choose sweeteners that do not list “aspartame” as one of the ingredients. aspartame has been the subject of concern as a potential contributor to cancer. it can also cause headaches in some people when consumed in products that contain it, such as equal.you can also cut down on calories by gradually reducing your use of sweetener until you eliminate it altogether. do this by adding just a little bit less to your coffee each day.; , using whole milk adds flavor but it also packs on the calories. instead, go “skinny” and opt for skim milk or low-fat milk instead. be aware that if you order in some coffee shops this swap may not be a possibility as they use premixed packages for certain drinks, especially seasonal ones.drink milk substitutes, such as soy or coconut milk, only in moderate amounts as they can contain high levels of sugars.it’s not necessary to remove milk products entirely from your coffee. in fact, milk has been shown to offset the calcium that coffee pulls out from your system.however, the amount of calcium coffee pulls from your system is very small, so just 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk is enough to offset it., read the labels on your store bought creamers paying particular attention to the calories, fats, and sugar content. buy a creamer that is made with artificial sweeteners. it may also help to move away from creamers that use a half-and-half type substance as their base. especially watch the ‘holiday flavored’ creamers as they are often loaded down with sugars and highly processed ingredients resulting in a higher calorie count. if you want a more healthy option, make your own creamer at home. stir skim milk, cinnamon, and artificial sweetener in a saucepan until it simmers. let it cool and refrigerate between uses., light, foamy drinks are less calorically dense. the foam takes up the space in the cup where more liquid could be. turn your attention toward a cappuccino with extra foam instead of your traditional latte. you could cut 40 calories just by making this exchange., if you are out at a coffeehouse, request that the barista put one less shot or pump of flavoring or syrup into your cup. keep lowering this number each time you visit until most of the extra shot calories are removed. you can save right around 70 calories a shot with this request., if you make coffee at home, simply stop buying whipped cream at the store. if you are at a restaurant, request that they “hold the whipped cream” when they make your drink. whipped cream is a staple with most specialty coffees but it

some headaches, thus reducing the severity of the headache. studies have shown that ginger can also help reduce the chances of migraines.ginger extract is also available in dietary capsules or as oil at most nutrition food stores. ginger can be a strong herb, therefore the recommended daily intake is 4 grams, including dietary sources. pregnant women should not take more than 1 gram of ginger per day.do not take ginger if you have a bleeding disorder or if you are taking blood-thinning medications, including aspirin., research shows that feverfew is an effective medicine for preventing or stopping migraine headaches. feverfew supplements are available fresh, freeze-dried, or dried. they can be purchased as capsules, tablets, or liquid extracts. feverfew supplements should contain at least 0.2% parthenolide, a natural compound found in the herb. the recommended daily intake is 50–100 mg once or twice daily. some precautions to remember are: people with allergies to chamomile, ragweed, or yarrow may be allergic to feverfew and should not take it. feverfew may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if you take blood-thinning medications. ask your doctor before taking feverfew if you take blood-thinners. pregnant and nursing women as well as children under 2 should not take feverfew. if you are scheduled for surgery, be sure to tell your doctor if you are taking feverfew. it may interact with anesthesia. do not stop taking feverfew abruptly if you have used it for more than 1 week. gradually lower the dose before stopping use. stopping feverfew too quickly may cause rebound headache, anxiety, fatigue, muscle stiffness, and joint pain., rosemary is widely used as a spice when cooking, especially in mediterranean dishes. rosemary has been used medicinally

snacks like potato chips, use apple chips as an alternative.fruit like strawberries, blueberries, or cut up melon is a great snack. hummus and pita bread are a romantic snack both of you can share. just avoid the garlic variation. if you’re going to bring candy try to keep it mature. things like sugar coated nuts or high quality chocolate are better than the cheap stuff you’d find at a gas

different from those here.; , then cut the plastic wrap and peel it completely off of the pizza. don’t forget to remove the plastic in your haste to enjoy a hot pizza. it will melt all over the pizza and make it inedible, and might make a big mess in your oven. do not allow your pizza to thaw before baking. get it out of the freezer only as your oven is preheating. , when your oven (or toaster oven) has finished preheating, place the pizza directly on the middle oven rack. this will produce the crispiest crust.alternatively, you can also place the pizza on a cookie sheet, which can either be room temperature or preheated (by placing it in the oven ahead of time). this will not produce the same degree of crust crispiness, though. be careful. remember, the oven and the rack will be extremely hot. if you are a child or are inexperienced with using the oven, have an adult or more knowledgeable baker assist you. , cooking times vary slightly depending upon the party pizza variety you choose and the type of oven you use. follow the package instructions. for instance:a cheese pizza should bake for approximately 11-12 minutes on the oven rack, 13-14 minutes on a cookie sheet, and 17-18 minutes in a toaster oven. a pepperoni pizza should bake for roughly the same amount of time as a cheese pizza. a supreme pizza should bake for about 14-16 minutes on the oven rack, and 17-19 minutes either on a cookie sheet or in a toaster oven. remember, however, to trust your eyes and remove the pizza when it looks done. these thin, small pizzas will overcook and burn quickly! , this is the easiest way to take the pizza out because a spatula can get right under the pizza to scrape it and bring it forward. if the pizza is on a baking sheet, remove the sheet from the oven first. hold the spatula in one hand and a plate big enough to hold the pizza in the other. quickly transfer the hot pizza to the plate, either by sliding or lifting and placing it with the spatula. remember — the

how to help yourself relax and calm down, will help in various stages of dealing with your anthropophobia. successful use of these techniques to reduce your fear takes careful planning and regular practice. try the following relaxation techniques. progressive muscle relaxation (pmr) is a practice where you consciously tense certain muscle groups then release the tension, noticing how it feels for the muscles to relax.try tensing and relaxing muscle groups going from top to bottom or bottom to top of your body. meditation is a practice where you sit comfortably and quietly, turning your attention to your mind.through mediation you attempt to increase your focus and clear your mind. you can try by focusing on just your breathing for a certain amount of time while trying to clear your mind of thoughts and anxieties. autogenics is a practice where you learn to self-produce a feeling of warmth and heaviness throughout your body resulting in feelings of relaxation. autogenics requires a meditative like practice of synchronized breathing and repeating phrases to yourself over the course of approximately 3 months., facing your anthropophobia and working through it (on your own or with a professional) involves being very specific about your fear and anxiety.just as journaling about your experience will help with treatment, so will an anxiety hierarchy. begin to identify a list of specific situations and the anxiety or fear you experience with each situation.your list or hierarchy should include the following. create 10 to 15 situations where you might experience fear or anxiety, such as spending time one on one with someone, being at a family gathering, being at an airport. most people discard some situations or pair some together, but you should end up with at least 10 situations. rank each based on how much anxiety you experience where 1 is the lowest anxiety and 10 is the highest anxiety imaginable. the levels should look like the following; low anxiety (1,2), low-moderate anxiety (3, 4), moderate anxiety (5, 6), moderate-high anxiety (7, 8) high anxiety (9, 10). make sure, when you are finished, that there are at least two situations in each anxiety level category. , while doing this alone is not recommended, you may find it difficult to access the professional help you need. if you cannot get the help of a doctor, psychologist, or counselor, you can

following for every item on your anxiety hierarchy.begin by using a relaxation technique for a few minutes. pick the lowest item in your hierarchy and imagine yourself in that situation for a tolerable amount of time. stop imagining the situation and rate your anxiety level. use a relaxation technique for at least 30 seconds. imagine the same situation again for a tolerable level of time. stop again and rate your anxiety level,", "respect is another stat that can be raised in gta san andreas, but unlike most of the stats listed above, it's next to impossible to raise it significantly from the beginning of the game. the higher your respect level, the more members of cj's grove street families gang you can recruit to help you with missions. having a posse alongside you can make many missions significantly easier than they would be otherwise, so it pays to build a lot of respect. respect is gained in the normal course of the game by completing certain missions. you can also increase respect passively by making sure cj wears green, the color of his gang, whenever he's inside grove street families territory. conquering another gang's territory and annexing it (by starting and winning a gang war, which essentially involves shooting a whole bunch of gang members) will raise cj's respect by a whole bunch (about 30%). tagging over another gang's graffiti grants a small increase. killing drug dealers, police officers, and members of rival gangs grants slight increases to respect. killing your own gang members, or letting them die, reduces respect. , fairly early on in the game, it's possible to start making a decent amount of money if you put your mind to it. missions provide a good amount, of course; citizens can also be killed for their cash. eventually, cj can purchase businesses to provide him with regular income, but until that point, saving your money whenever you can afford to will grant you significant advantages later. drug dealers not only grant you respect when killed; they're also a great source of money. they tend to be short-tempered and well-armed, but if you snag a heavy vehicle like a semi truck and flatten them, they won't have much of a chance to fight back. you can also use sniper bullets to waste them from a distance. getting busted or wasted will cost you money. if you save regularly, you can just reload the game instead and avoid the fees, although they aren't really that high. another hidden cost of getting wasted or busted is the loss of all your weapons. if you've managed to collect a nice little arsenal, consider reloading to save yourself the cost and trouble of finding or buying your guns again. if you really want to game the system, save the game, then bet everything you have at an inside track betting shop. if you lose, reload and try again until you win. each time you win, you'll multiply your money by a significant factor, and soon end up with more than you even knew you wanted. this type of trick is commonly known as “save scumming.” it's effective, but many people consider it to be not in the spirit of the game, since it provides near-instant gratification with no immersion in the game world required. set aside an extra save before you take advantage of it, just in case you find that the rest of the game's money missions become dull and lackluster afterward. , there are a", "the benefits you provide, existence of written contracts, and how the organization and the staff member perceive the relationship also affects whether they are classified as an employee or a contractor. the existence of a well written contract is pretty good proof you have a contractor relationship with them. you are more likely to have a client-like relationship with an independent contractor. they provide a service and you pay them for that service, but they also are free to provide that service to other individuals or organizations at a price they negotiate. think about this relationship in terms of the charitable interests of your organization. an independent contractor who writes grant proposals for you technically could write a grant proposal for another organization whose interests directly conflicted with yours. if the staff member was an employee, however, this wouldn't be appropriate. expecting a staff member to be loyal to your charitable cause typically indicates that you have an employee-employer working relationship with them. similarly, on the other hand, they typically would be considered an employee.; , while you may think classifying employees as contractors will save your organization some money, this classification isn't entirely up to you. the irs looks at several factors to determine whether you should be paying payroll taxes for your employees. one of the factors the irs looks at to determine whether someone is an employee or a contractor is how much control the organization has over what that person does and how they do their job.this factor generally concerns the extent to which you control the employee's time and behavior. for example, if an employee is working on the clock in your organization's offices, they typically couldn't be considered an independent contractor because you have extensive control over their actions while they're on the job. in contrast, if you have a staff member who works from home on their own time and is free to work whatever hours they want as long as they complete a certain amount of work each week, you are exhibiting a lot less control over their behavior. typically someone who is paid by the hour and works in the organization's offices will be considered an employee. this is particularly true if they have scheduled hours and breaks and are expected to remain at their desk or other designated area while they are on the clock. keep in mind also that the amount of training your staff receives may affect whether the irs will classify them as employees or contractors. contractors typically are expected to bring their own skills and work ethic to bear on an assignment, while employees are told exactly how to complete a task. , staff members are more likely to be classified as employees rather than contractors if the organization reimburses expenses and provides the tools or supplies needed to carry out their work.if a staff member is responsible for providing their own equipment and supplies, you're typically safe considering them a contractor rather than an employee, assuming the other factors line up with that classification. similar analysis applies", "this means you should try to

to understand.when using action verbs, it’s important that you choose the right verb for the sentence or phrase. choosing the wrong action verb can actually make your writing very confusing for your reader and leave them with only a vague idea of what you are trying to describe. make sure you know exactly what the action verb means before you put it in a sentence or phrase. some action verbs, like “illustrate”, “reveal”, and “illuminate” are all other ways to say “show”. but other action verbs, like “analyze”, “compare” and “evaluate” all have different meanings and should be used to fit the context of the phrase or sentence. a list of action verbs for resumes and professional writing can be found here.; , often when we compose first drafts in writing, we resort to weak verbs or simple verbs. for example: “show”, “look” “think” “do”. while these are very clear verbs, they may come across as flat or underwhelming, especially when used in a resume to describe your credentials and achievements. replace weak verbs with action verbs that add punch to your writing and to be as persuasive as possible. potential employers will appreciate a resume that is concise and showcases your skills in a clear and strong way.for example, rather than state on your resume: “showed clients how to use security software”, you can use an action verb: “demonstrated how to use security software to clients.” instead of stating: “ran the dining room service”, rephrase this with action verbs: “organized and supervised the dining room service.” rather than note you “put together the team’s schedules and timelines”, use action verbs to make the sentence more specific by noting you “coordinated the team’s schedules and timelines” or you “created the team’s schedules and timelines.” , the passive voice is when the subject in a sentence is not the doer or the actor (as in the active voice) but is being acted upon. often, the passive voice uses “was” and “had” in front of a weak verb. the subject and object are also flipped in a passive sentence, for example: \"the road was crossed by the chicken\", rather than \"the chicken crossed the road.\" though there is nothing grammatically incorrect about the passive voice, using the active voice, with action verbs, can make your sentences stronger and more direct.for example, a sentence in the passive voice would be: “a poll on how many people use private healthcare in my neighborhood was conducted by me for my year end project.” if this sentence is adjusted to the active voice, with action verbs, it would be: “for my year end project, i created and prepared a poll of private healthcare use in my neighborhood.” , start by making a list of your skills and abilities in simple language, with simple verbs. read over the list and replace", "the only way you can reach self-actualization is to envision what your actualized self will look like. connecting with your future self is an important step in reaching personal goals. two ways you can connect with your future self are:creating a vision board. prepare a collage – either online or with photos and paper – that sums up the future self you hope to become. browse through magazine or online galleries and search for pictures and phrases that represent the person you envision yourself becoming. paste all these images and words together to create a larger image depicting your future self. writing a letter. another powerful way to forge a connection with your future self is with a “dear future me” letter. write in detail about all the things you are proud of or inspired by about your future self. go on to tell exactly how and why your future self reached these successes.; , once you have a general idea of where you want to end up you need to go back to the drawing board and figure out how to get there. pinpointing your personal values can give insight on what drives your decisions, beliefs, and ideas. think of your values as a road map directing you to your future self. identify your values by doing the following:think of two people you admire. what characteristics describe them? if you could change something about your local community or the world in general, what would it be? if your house was on fire, what three things would you take with you? when was the last time you felt really accomplished? describe the moment and why you felt this way. which topics do you stand up for or get really riled up about? why do these topics get you going? once you have considered these questions/statements, look for themes in your answers. any recurring themes may shed light on your values. , after you have performed an analysis of your values, compare these to your future self. do your current values coincide with the life you hope to someday lead? now, reflect on your everyday behaviors, beliefs, and principles. do these match your values and the person you hope to be? if you are not currently living out the values that are important to you or that will help you manifest into your future self, you will need to do some restructuring and goal-setting., you can have the most inspiring goals, but if they are not supporting your personal values, your success won't feel like success.for example, joe finds that his biggest values are community involvement, integrity, and leadership. in his current job, he is a supervisor at a non-profit organization that offers scholarships and training to under-served student populations. he learns that all the funds are not being directed to students as he once thought. despite him meeting his values of community involvement and leadership, joe may feel dissatisfied with his job because the organization is not one of integrity. joe must develop new goals that align with his values to bring", "if an item gives you a \"buy it now\" option, you will be able to bypass the auction process and purchase the item immediately. the price of \"buy it now\" items an vary quite a lot - depending on the seller's strategy: sometimes the \"buy it now\" price will be very low -- this is when the seller is trying to get rid of the item in a hurry, so they sell it at a lower than average price. you can get some great deals using the \"buy it now\" option, but these items get snapped up quickly, so you will have to act fast to avail of them. a good way to deal with this is to set up email notifications, where ebay will notify you when a particular item becomes available for immediate purchase.on the other hand, the \"buy it now\" price can often be higher than the average bidding price. this is because sellers are counting on buyers who need particular items in a hurry and are not willing to wait the several days it takes to bid in an auction. so unless you are in a hurry, it's important that you do your research to find out the average selling price for a particular item, before buying it using \"buy it now\". , if the \"buy it now\" option is unavailable, or you're hoping to get a better deal on an item, you can use ebay's innovative online bidding system. the bidding system is very simple, all you need to do enter the maximum amount that you would be willing to pay for an item. ebay will then compare this amount to the bids of other potential buyers and will increase your bid incrementally each time you are outbid. they will continually raise your bid until they reach your maximum amount.ebay will only raise the price of your bid high enough to outbid other potential buyers. once they reach your maximum amount, and the auction is still running, you will either need to accept defeat or raise your maximum bid. once you have placed a bid, there is no way to retract it. if you win the auction, you will be obligated to buy the item. if you refuse, you will face penalties from ebay and may even have your account suspended. , make a note of how much longer the auction will be running for and check back periodically to see how your bid is doing. once the auction ends, you will receive an email notification from ebay informing you whether you won the item or not. if you did, the email will also provide instructions on what to do next. , the next step is to complete your payment for the item. you can reach the payment page by clicking on the \"pay now\" link, which can be found on the \"review order\" page, on the confirmation email, on the listing page and on the \"purchase history\" page on my ebay. the viable payment options are decided by the seller, and while most will accept payment", "there are a lot of reasons to write an email in a business setting. pinpointing the primary purpose of the email will help you determine the best way to wrap it up.for example, if you are making a request, end with something like, “thank you for your time,” or “thanks for your consideration.” if you are responding to a request for information or assistance, you could end with “i hope this helps!” or “let me know if there’s any other way i could be of assistance.” if you’re setting up a face-to-face meeting, you might end with something like, “see you next week!”; , think about how well you know the person you are writing to, what kind of relationship you have with them, and what you are trying to accomplish. an email to an upper-level manager or an important new client should probably be more formal than an email to a well-known co-worker.for example, if you are setting up a meeting with a client, a good closing statement might be something like, “i look forward to our meeting on the 24th. if you have any questions, please contact me at 555-555-5555.” on the other hand, if you are arranging a friendly meeting with a coworker you know well, it may be perfectly fine to end with something like, “sounds good! see you tomorrow! :)” , if this is your first email about the topic at hand, or if it’s a particularly important email, then it’s probably a good idea to include a closing thank you or “call to action.” however, brevity is important in business emails. if your email is part of a long chain, you may not need to include anything beyond the most essential information.for example, if you’re wrapping up a long conversation over email with your boss about an assignment, you may not need to say much more than, “ok. i will have it done before the end of the day on friday. –m.” , if your email is formal, sign off with something like “best regards,” or (for an even more formal touch) “sincerely.” for less formal emails, you may be fine using something like “take care” or “cheers.”if you’ve had previous emails from the person you’re writing to, you might look at their sign-off and match your tone to theirs. for example, if they tend to sign with something like “warm regards,” you should sign off with a similar level of formality. , like the closing sentence, a sign-off can also reflect the purpose of your email. for example, if you’re making a simple request or briefly expressing gratitude for something, you might use a sign-off like “many thanks,” or “thanks so much,” followed by your signature., unless you know the person you’re writing to very well, avoid anything too slangy, informal, or affectionate. in general, things like “love,” “xoxo,” or “hugs” should not be used in business emails., if your email is part of a long chain, or if you’re trying to communicate something very briefly and quickly to a co-worker, it may not be", "you will want to wear clothes that will not restrict your movements or blood flow. don’t wear clothes which are too tight, especially around your joints. you will also want to wear clothing which is made of a material which breathes well, since you will sweat when doing many forms of exercise. clothes specifically designed for exercise can easily be found.; , just because we call them tennis shoes does not mean they are great athletic shoes. shoes like converse have little shock absorbency and can be terrible

help your muscles work and also to help you sweat. if you’re dehydrated before you start, just think about how you’ll feel afterwards! , don’t stretch before exercising. contrary to popular belief, studies have shown that this is not helpful and will not allow you to perform any better. if anything, stretching before exercising will make you worse off: it’s a great way to pull or strain a muscle and hurt yourself! , though researchers cannot agree definitively on whether or not warm ups help you to perform better in exercises, they all agree that warming up certainly won’t hurt.warm up before exercising by doing a less intense version of your intended workout for 5-10 minutes. if you plan to run, jog first. if you intend to swim, swim slowly. , certain conditions may make it a good idea to check with your doctor before starting an exercise regimen. there are exercises for every health condition, but it’s a good idea to know what to avoid. exercising should make you feel healthy and good in your own body: not hurt you! if you have diseases or conditions like asthma or lung problems, arthritis, diabetes or liver and kidney problems, or heart disease, definitely talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.if you notice certain problems, you will also want to talk to a doctor. these include things like pain or dizziness following physical exertion, shortness of breath after very mild exertion or when at rest, or swelling in the ankles. you may also want to talk to a doctor simply to find out what kind of exercise they recommend for your particular goals and health conditions. you can also consult with a nutritionist and a trainer for more information on exercising and how you can best meet your goals. , aerobic exercise is often called a “cardio”

want to wear clothes that are too big or loose, because these will make your breasts look bigger but will also make you look bigger over all. instead, just wear clothes that fit you, neither too loose nor too tight. not only will this be more comfortable, but it will reduce the visual appearance of your chest.; , wear shirts that are long, with a hem line down around the widest part of your hips. this will draw the eye downward and away from the chest, while also emphasizing your hips. together, this will do a lot to reduce the appearance of your hips. , wear shirts that flare out below the natural waist. this will help draw the eye downward and away from the chest. this style of shirt is very trendy and in fashion right now as well. , wearing a dark shirt in general, using colors like black, navy, and forest green, will reduce the appearance of your chest. this works by reducing the appearance of highlights and shadows, which makes it harder for the eye to perceive depth and shape. if you want to make the effect even stronger, pair the dark top with a skirt or pants that are brightly colored. wearing turquoise, pink, yellow, red, or other bright colors will draw the eye down from your chest to your hips and legs. , in general, wearing clothes that emphasize your hips will draw attention away from your chest and make it look smaller by comparison. wear horizontally striped pants or skirts and when you wear skirts, try to wear full, circle skirts. these will add volume to your lower half and make your body look more even. , turtlenecks and especially bulky turtle neck sweaters will only make your chest look bigger. tight turtlenecks will only make your breasts look bigger and thicker turtlenecks will just add bulk, achieving the same effect. , natural waist tops, which draw the waistline upwards, and empire waist tops which create the cinch of the waist just below the breast line both serve to make the bust look bigger. avoid both of these styles as they will only emphasize your chest by making it look bigger in comparison to your waist. , of course, you'll want to skip tops that emphasize your cleavage. anything that is very low cut is only going to make your breasts look bigger. so much bigger, in fact, that they'll probably accurately look like they're on the verge of falling out! instead, wear items that are slightly higher cut. for some people, v-neck and sweetheart necklines will make the cleavage and bust look bigger and more noticeable. some people, however, find that they prefer the appearance they get with this neck style. experiment to

there are multiple toy-weapons available at party city and online. mock weapons are also sold as children's toys in stores. , the face paint, or \"war paint\" as it is called in \"the dark knight\", not only hides the joker's true identity but enforces the image that gotham's citizens have of him. replications of his makeup are simple to create. first, appropriate the following: white face paint; black face paint, eyeshadow, or liquid eyeliner; and red face paint or lipstick. coat your face from the top of your forehead to your chin in white face paint, also coating your ears. to follow heath ledger's joker costume, smudge black face paint, liquid eyeliner, or eyeshadow heavily over your eyelids. there is no need for strict lines or boundaries; as long as your eyelids are coated and the edges look hazy, it'll work. for the lips, cover your lips in red lipstick and either run the red lipstick in a thick, vague line about an inch and a half past both corners of your mouth. the line should curve like the joker's demonic grin and blend a little bit into the white. to achieve the look, draw the lines on your cheeks and smudge them lightly with your fingers. conversely, if you wish to look more like jack nicholson's joker, lightly line your eyes with black liquid eyeliner. don't get any in your waterline, keep the liner in a very thin line on the outside of your eyelid. next, cover the area of your lips in red lipstick and very carefully extend the lines outward to recreate the shape of his very thin lips. don't just draw thin lines, but extend the shape of your lips to

book, you’ll be more likely to choose a book that can be reasonably read within a week. don’t choose a short story that can be read in 30 minutes; likewise don’t read an 800 page book that will take 13-14 hours to complete if you don’t have the time nor patience. timing is especially relevant when you have a deadline such as an assignment for school. also consider your history with reading. if you are used to reading only one 400 page book per month, try to choose a book that is a fraction of that size, like 150-200 pages. this allows your goal to be realistic while still challenging.; , if you have a choice, pick a book that will really pique your interest instead of choosing a boring book that will only make you want to stop reading. try one from your favorite author, read a review online, choose based on recommendations from others, or choose based on your personal interest in subjects.many people read a variety of subjects as a means to get better at being a human and being a life-long learner.try keeping a reading list of books that you want to read. whenever you come across a book that interests you, update your list so you always have something interesting from which to choose., there are many times people are unable to choose their reading material because it has been assigned to them for school, work, or other projects. even if you find yourself hating the material, set a plan in motion to keep reading. keep in mind that even if you don’t like something, you can always learn from it, which is usually the goal. not only will it be preparing you for an immediate gain (like a good grade on a test), but it will also provide you with knowledge of a person or topic of which you were previously unaware.even if you feel the text doesn’t keep your attention, you can always focus on what worked or didn’t work, what the author did well and what they didn’t. not only will this show a deep analysis of the text, but it will also help you in determining what books you prefer to read. commit to your goal. if you are forced to read an assigned book within a week’s time, prepare yourself by truly committing to the goal. always remind yourself of what depends on your completion of the book (a grade, a report, a presentation, etc.). , this is especially helpful if you have an assignment due date or if you consider yourself a weak-willed individual. having a routine in place will help you to stick with reading and help you reach your goal. learning your reading speed will help you determine how many hours it will take you

area around it may indicate that you have a shoulder injury.you might notice pain at all times or just when you move or apply pressure to the affected area. pay attention to how your shoulder feels at rest and when you move it. joint separations are graded from mild (grade one) to severe (grade three). grade one is a sprain, grade two is a partial separation, and grade three is a full separation. a grade one ac separation might just feel sore, while a grade three separation might cause intense pain.grades one through three are the most common classifications, but there are actually three more grades: four, five, and six. these are rare and usually involve tearing of the deltoid and/or trapezius muscles.along with pain, you might also notice some swelling in your shoulder if you have a grade two or grade three ac separation.; , as you move your shoulder joint around, it should be silent. if you hear any popping sounds, it may mean that you have injured your ac joint. gently rotate

is a symptom of a separated ac joint.your clavicle is the bone that connects your breastbone to your shoulder. place your hand on your clavicle and gently push it to see if it moves or remains stationary. your clavicle should not move when you press it. movement in your clavicle is also more common with a grade three ac separation and indicates that you need to see a doctor as soon as possible. , try to rotate your injured shoulder in all different directions. not being able to move your injured shoulder in the same ways as you can move your other shoulder may be a sign of a separated ac joint. try moving your shoulder in the following ways: lift your shoulder up. push your shoulder down. pull your shoulder across your body. pull your shoulder out to the side. pull your shoulder back and stretch it behind your head. , cold or numbing sensations in your extremities or fingers can also be a sign that you have suffered a shoulder injury. apply some gentle pressure to

recommended that you soak the beans before cooking them. doing so softens the beans and also removes most of the water-soluble components responsible for digestive upset. note that with adzuki beans, however, you can often skip the soaking process without suffering adverse reactions. soaking will make the beans slightly easier to digest, but it is not absolutely essential. you can soak the beans anywhere from 1 hour to overnight.; , drain the water by pouring the contents of the pot through a colander. rinse the adzuki beans several times under running water before returning them to the pot and adding fresh water. the water will need to cover the beans by about 2 inches (5 cm). fill the stockpot with cold water so that the beans cook more evenly. , if you want to add bacon to the beans, you can do so at this point. cut the bacon into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces and place it directly into the pot of water and beans.bacon gives the adzuki beans a smoky, salty flavor. as such, this works well if you intend to eat the beans on their own or want to add them to a hearty dish, like chili. it may not work so well if you intend to use them in a sweeter or milder dish. , cover the stockpot and bring the water up to a boil over high heat. , as soon as the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium and let the beans continue to simmer until they become tender enough to pierce with a fork. if you soaked the adzuki beans beforehand, this should only take about 60 minutes. if you did not soak the beans or soaked them for less than an hour, you might need to wait closer to 90 minutes. tilt the lid slightly as the beans simmer so that steam can escape, thereby avoiding a build-up of pressure. periodically skim off excess foam that rises to the top of the water as the beans cook. if necessary, add more water if too much of it seems to escape during the cooking process. , the beans can be served or added to recipes as they are, but if you want something a little more flavorful, you can add salt, black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, or your other favorite bean seasonings after turning off the heat and draining the beans. you should drain the beans before adding your seasonings to ensure that the seasonings stick to the beans and do not get lost or diluted in the water. , drain the beans, if you have not done so in the seasoning step, and serve the beans while still hot. you can serve adzuki beans in tortilla shells, in a bowl with a side of cornbread, or with cooked rice. the beans can also be added to", "asthma attacks are caused by triggers. triggers are different substances or events that cause your airways to become more inflamed, causing an attack. in order to write a detailed action plan, you need to be able to list all your triggers and how much they affect you. as time passes, keep a lookout for any new triggers and add them to your plan. common triggers can include: irritants from cigarette smoke, chemicals in the air, fumes from cleaning and beauty products, and air pollution allergens from animal fur, dust, mold, cockroaches, grasses, trees, and flowers sickness such as colds and other viral infections of the lungs

peak flow rate every day to check if your asthma is getting worse. talk to your doctor about getting a peak flow meter. a low measurement on a peak flow meter is an indication that your lungs are not working as well as they should be., when you start to write your action plan, you need all of the relevant information that will help take care of an attack. these relevant facts include: a list of all the medications you are taking, both long-term and short-term what your ideal peak flow measurements are, which may be used with moderate to severe asthma patients and will be determined by your doctor. names and numbers of emergency contacts, which should include a loved ones, your doctor, and your local hospital, your asthma action plan requires you to understanding your condition and know your asthma history. the plan is a written document that outlines the steps you need to take in order to deal with your asthma and stop it from getting worse. you need your doctor and respiratory therapist to help you outline the best set of steps to help treat your asthma anywhere you go. in preparation for your plan, you doctor may have you track your symptoms so you know what triggers you

medical attention.if you want a base action plan to start from, you can download one from the american lung association. , the american lung association recommends that your action plan be divided into three sections called zones. these zones reflect the severity of your asthma attack. the green zone is when you have no problem breathing, you are not coughing or wheezing, and you can go about your daily activities like normal., the second section, called the yellow zone, is the zone that you need when you are experiencing some kind of asthma symptoms but", "the shakespearean sonnet is a good place to start if you’re a novice sonneteer because it has the most regular and straightforward rhyme scheme and structure. the rhyme scheme of a shakespearean sonnet always follows this pattern: ababcdcdefefggthese letters represent the sound that appears at the end of each line. so, following this pattern of alternating rhymes, we find that the last words of the first and third lines must rhyme; the second and fourth; the fifth and seventh; the sixth and eighth; and so on, ending in a final rhyming couplet.; , iambic pentameter is a very regular meter and is one of the most common meters in english-language poetry. “pentameter” derives from the greek word pente (meaning five), and thus has five poetic \"feet.\" each foot is a unit of two syllables; thus, there are ten syllables in a line of pentameter. “iambic” means that each foot is an “iamb.” iambs are comprised of an unstressed, followed by a stressed syllable, resulting in a “ta-tum” rhythm. the word “hel-lo” is an example of an iambic foot. so a line of iambic pentameter is a line of five iambic feet, resulting in a 10-syllable rhythm of ta-tum ta-tum ta-tum ta-tum ta-tum. an example of a line of iambic pentameter is “shall i / compare/ thee to / a sum / mer's day?” (from shakespeare’s “sonnet 18”), although the majority of the lines in a shakespearean sonnet should be written in iambic pentameter, the rhythm can get plodding and predictable if you use it exclusively. by varying the stress pattern slightly at key moments, you can break up the pattern and make the poem more aurally interesting for the reader, and also use the variation to draw attention to key phrases in your poem. for example, the third line of shakespeare’s “sonnet 18” begins with a spondee, meaning two stressed syllables in a row: tum-tumafter two lines of perfect iambic pentameter, he wrote: “rough winds / do shake / the dar / ling buds / of may” this both breaks up the rhythm for a little variation and draws attention to the roughness of the rough winds being described. , a shakespearean sonnet is composed of three heroic quatrains and a heroic couplet. a heroic quatrain is a group of four lines of iambic pentameter in an abab rhyme scheme; a heroic couplet is a group of two lines of iambic pentameter in an aa rhyme scheme.in a shakespearean sonnet, the three heroic quatrains are the “abab cdcd efef” portion of the rhyme scheme the heroic couplet is the “gg” closing. you can separate these stanzas with blank lines, or leave them all together in an unbroken poem, but the sonnet should move as a function of these discrete stanzas. , although your poem should have a single focus, each stanza of the sonnet should develop the idea further. think of each quatrain as a little thought bubble, like a paragraph, in which you explore an element of the subject of your poem. each quatrain should build toward the final couplet, where", "if you aren’t certain about something your teacher said, or didn’t understand the way something was presented, make sure to raise your hand and ask for clarification. the best notes in the world can’t help you if you don’t understand what you’re taking notes on. remember that the objective is to learn, so don’t be afraid to ask questions.some professors may ask for you to hold your questions until after the lecture. make sure to write them down to help you recall what you wanted to ask when the time comes. if you aren’t comfortable speaking in front of the class, try approaching your teacher after class to clarify things you are unsure of.; , in order to take effective notes, you will need to learn to pick out the important portions of what your teacher or professor says during their lecture. disregard conversational material and focus on things your teacher places an emphasis on during class. make sure to make note of any new topic, questions you have, and anything the teacher places a large emphasis on while covering the course material.if there was assigned reading prior to the class, make note of anything covered in the lecture that differs from how it was presented in the book. your teacher likely wants you to follow the methodology taught in class. things teachers write out on the board are usually important and should be considered when note taking. make sure to record new topics, formulas needed to solve equations, and anything the teacher suggests is important. , taking great notes can help you to retain information in the first place, but studying for an exam or test should always include a thorough review of your notes. you should always go over your notes again after class, then refresh your memory by reviewing them once more before a test. you may also want to compare notes with a classmate to help ensure you both took down all of the important information.studies have shown that after a week, you can usually only recall 35% of what you learned in class. retention and recall can drop as low as 21% after two weeks. reviewing your notes or going over them with a friend can refresh your memory and help to ensure you retain more of the course material. , some people may prefer to use their laptop for note taking rather than writing by hand. if you feel as though you could write faster or take more efficient notes using a laptop computer, you should consider doing so. some teachers and professors don’t permit open laptops in their class, so make sure laptop use is permitted before you start.laptops can help you to organize your notes and even type them faster in some cases. make sure you don’t allow yourself to get distracted by using other applications on your laptop during the lecture. you may want to ensure the laptop you use to take notes in math class has a keypad to record numbers faster. , it can sometimes be hard to keep up when", "“repetition is the mother of all skills.” what that means is if you practice a task over and over again, you will get better at the task. place emphasis on conducting the task repeatedly to standard if you are weak at a specific task. this process develops your “muscle memory” to the point where focused conscience thought is not required. the action becomes a reflex or habit.; , if you want to learn how to use a vehicle, in particular, helicopters and jets, you should practice off-line. both types of aircraft can be difficult to master. don’t degrade other peoples’ on-line gaming experience, handicap your team by using a piece of valuable equipment, or lower your own global stats by practicing on a 64/64 ranked server. instead, start a \"local\" server, and join the game. the game won't start because there is only 1 player, but you can use all the equipment you want without fear of another player (in multi-player) or a bot (in single-player) getting to it first. another option is to find empty servers, or servers where the game hasn't started due to insufficient players. , you can learn a lot by watching other players. take note of successful actions and put it into your kit bag. , know where you should and should not go when moving across the map or assaulting a position. this is invaluable information to preserve your soldier’s life and to terminate the lives of enemy soldiers. , when you are prone, you accomplish two very important things. first, you are a smaller, more difficult target to hit. second, your weapon has greater stability and therefore is more accurate (a tighter shot group). you will survive longer and get more kills by going prone. you can also go prone when going down a steep hill, and you will slide down the hill instead of falling and getting injured. , never under-estimate the benefits of crawling in the prone. sure, it takes longer, but it can keep you from getting killed. the enemy can’t kill you if he is not able to detect your presence. , using crouch can provide concealment behind some vegetation and cover behind some walls. crouch will also improve your accuracy versus firing standing (off-hand). , use cover and concealment to mask your movement and position. don't just stop in the middle of a street and start firing. you won’t last long. take into consideration the enemy commander’s scan and overhead satellite viewing ability. when the enemy commander scans, he may or may not have the time to check-out your position. if he does check out your position, the concealment of a tree may place doubt as to your exact location. another consideration is artillery. concrete buildings and corrugated steel hangers and shelters will provide cover (protection) from artillery. , when you double-tap your move “forward\" key (default is w), or hit the \"sprint\" key (default is shift) you will move at a much faster pace. on the lower left corner of your screen, you will see a sprint meter that", "this is by far the easiest, most sure-fire way to get an upgrade. however, unless you fly often with the airline and have earned elite status, it's also the most expensive way to enjoy the perks of first class.; , airlines categorize their customers based on how often they fly—or more to the point, how much they spend! at 50k miles a year, you are in the middle of the \"elite\" zone, a position that makes you important to the airline. you'll be rewarded with various perks along the way—from quick check-ins, to bonus miles, to first-class upgrades. if you don't normally travel a lot for business or pleasure, consider \"mileage running.\" this is the process of finding cheap, long flights and taking them whenever possible. the destination is not important—only the distance. a good rule of thumb for determining if a mileage run is worth it is if the price-per-mile cost is $.02 or below. check out online resources such as farecompare for prices and opportunities.you might also consider whether you fly frequently enough to maintain elite status. , arrive at the airport a couple hours early, and check in using the airline's kiosk. you will be able to modify your seat assignment as available, and if there are any first-class seats available, you may be able to purchase an upgrade at a significantly reduced cost. , when there is one upgrade available and two elite flyers are requesting it, all else being equal: the one who checks in first gets it. you must have elite status with the airline for this to work. , take advantage of opportunities that arise during the normal course of travel. all airlines over-book flights, and sometimes, when they least expect it, everybody shows up for the flight. when that happens, they have to find people willing to be bumped from that flight. that could be you! if the flight is very overbooked, your bargaining position is strong. approach the gate agent, and be as genuinely charming and sympathetic as you can be. ask them if they would consider rebooking you in return for an upgrade voucher in addition to whatever other incentives they might be offering. this will be more likely to work if you don't have checked baggage, which would entail much more work on the part of the airlines in order to bump you. , some airlines have relaxed upgrade policies for full-fare coach tickets. you may also have friends who have upgrade vouchers they may be willing to sell. , if you are a regular flier, are considering doing mileage runs, and are planning a big trip that you want to enjoy in first-class style, you can also purchase miles directly from the airlines. visit your airline's website, and locate the \"purchase miles\" page, generally located in the frequent-flier part of the site. enter your account number, and how many miles you wish to purchase. , when you book directly with the airline, there is the possibility of also adding an osi (other significant information) notation to your record. based on", "the deaf community faces adversity, and as such, a variety of support groups are available. you may meet people who have recently become deaf or hard of hearing or have been like that their entire life. you’re likely to meet someone who has had a similar experience to yours. ask someone to get coffee or a bite to eat after the group to make a new friend. make this attempt with someone whom you feel you can make a connection with. however, don’t take this step until you feel like you really know this person. you may also want to set up a group function to begin with, instead of a one-on-one meeting.locate a group that matches your circumstances. many national organizations offer local support groups like the ag bell association for the deaf and hard of hearing and the american speech-language-hearing association (asha)., some establishments, such as restaurants, clubs, and theatres, may hold a night in which their activities are catered to the deaf. not only is this a great way to meet new people, but you’ll likely make a lot of friends in the process.look online to search for events like this that are happening in your area. take a friend—hearing or not—to go with you if you’re feeling shy or unconfident. , you’re sure to get in touch with people you can become friends with if you join an organization that supports the rights of the deaf or hard of hearing. you share the same beliefs and likely want the same end goal. the national association of the deaf is a good resource and place to start. you may be able to volunteer your time there and become friends with people who are well known in the deaf community., people who have recently become deaf or hard of hearing often attend american sign language (asl) classes so they can learn about this type of communication. consider attending such a class if you find yourself in the same situation. you may form a relationship and create a bond with someone who has also found themselves experiencing this significant life change.consider teaching a class if you are fluent in asl. along with educating people, you may make a new friend. , it may seem like a struggle, but deaf-hearing friendships are possible. this may be necessary if you go to a school or work in a job where you are the only person with hearing loss. either way, it's great to have friends from all walks of life.participate in a club or organization at your school like the drama club. connect with others who have the same interests, such as joining a local meetup for hikers. , many hearing people may shy away from making friends because they don't know how to communicate with you appropriately. if you take initiative to start conversations with them, they will feel more inclined to starting a friendship.send a message to someone you find interesting on social media saying \"hi.\" keep a notepad or your phone handy so you can pass \"notes\" to hearing people", "you can design a flyer digitally with tools such as photoshop or microsoft publisher. alternatively, you could design a flyer with pen, pencil, markers, etc., and then photocopy the flier at a copy shop. , it could be color in the writing, images, even the paper you print on. color draws the eye and gets attention. printing in grayscale on color paper can also be a cost-effective alternative to adding color to your flyers. a color scheme can be very effective.use a color wheel to come up with basic color harmonies. for example, you could stick to analogous colors (adjacent ones on the color wheel), like different shades of blues and greens. or, you could use complementary colors, such as red and green.a color matching the image you use in the flyer is even better. for example, if your picture shows a sunrise, you could use oranges and yellows. to make the yellow letters pop, they could be outlined in black. , flyer size depends in large part on the function of the flyer and your ability to produce flyers of a certain size. it’s easiest to print digital flyers on printer size paper (8.5 x 11 inches). so, your flyers can be that size, or you might want to cut them in half or quarters if your flyer doesn’t need to be as big (e.g. if it’s a handout). your fliers can be any size, though, and you can make larger size flyers relatively easily if you’re going to a printer that prints that size. , are you planning on hanging your flyer inside on a bulletin board or outside on a telephone pole? maybe you plan on handing out flyers at an event or in a busy part of town. maybe you’re even using the flyers for a mailing. if the flyers are to be hung outdoors, consider printing on stronger paper and with waterproof ink. , make it big, bold, and simple. in general, the headline should be no more than a few words, fit in one line across the page, and be centered. a headline can be longer, but the briefer it is, the better the chance it has to capture someone’s attention. , the lettering in the headline should be bigger than any other lettering on the flyer. you want most people to be able to read it quickly from about 10 feet (3 meters) away. you’ll usually want the headline spaced evenly across the entire width of the page. if it doesn’t quite fit or fit nicely, consider centering the text. , look at any newspaper's front-page headline; that industry figured this out a long time ago. don’t get too fancy with this font, as your primary goal here is readability. you can add flair to other parts of the flyer if it adds to your message. , you are trying to grab attention with your flyer, and convey your message in often fractions of a second. complicated messages and content will likely not make an impact. more detail can follow in the body of the", "do not try to force the other person to eat. don’t bribe your loved one to eat more, or use threats to compel behavior. sometimes, anorexia is a response to a lack of feeling control over one’s own life. engaging in a power struggle or taking control away from your loved one may only make the problem worse.don’t try to “fix” your loved one’s problem. recovery is as complex as the eating disorder. trying to “fix” your loved one on your own may do more harm than good. encourage him/her to see a mental health professional, instead. , anorexia often involves a great deal of shame and embarrassment for the person suffering from it. even if well-meaning, commenting on your loved one’s appearance, eating habits, weight, etc., can trigger his/her feelings of shame and disgust. compliments are also unhelpful. because the person is dealing with a distorted body image, s/he is unlikely to believe you. s/he may interpret even positive comments as judgment or manipulation., if your loved one comments that s/he feels “fat,” it’s important not to respond by saying things like, “you’re not fat.” this only reinforces the unhealthy idea that “fat” is something innately bad that should be feared and avoided.similarly, do not point out thin people and comment on their appearance, such as “nobody wants to hug a bony person.” you want your loved one to develop a healthy body image, not focus on fearing or diminishing one particular type of body. instead, ask your loved one where those feelings are coming from. ask what s/he thinks s/he would gain by being thin, or what s/he fears about feeling overweight. , anorexia and other eating disorders are highly complex and often co-occur with other illnesses, such as anxiety and depression. peer and media pressure may play a role, as may family and social situations. saying things such as “if you would just eat more, things would be fine” ignore the complexity of the issue your loved one is struggling with. instead, offer your support with “i”-statements: “i realize this is a tough time for you” or “eating differently can be hard, and i believe in you.” , the struggle to be “perfect” is a common factor in triggering anorexia. however, perfectionism is an unhealthy way of thinking that hampers your ability to adapt and be flexible, a crucial part of success in life.it holds you and others to an impossible, unrealistic, and ever-shifting standard.do not expect perfection from your loved one or yourself. recovering from an eating disorder may take a long time, and both of you will have times when you act in a way that you regret. acknowledge when one of you slips up, but don’t focus on it or beat yourself up for it. instead, focus on what you can do going forward to avoid similar mistakes. , however, you do not want to help promote your loved one’s behavior. anorexia may cause early death in up to 20% of its sufferers.it’s important to encourage your loved one to get help. understand that your

your credit score include:late or missed payments erroneously reported loan modifications reported as “foreclosures” closed cards reported as “closed by grantor” bad debts more than seven years old still showing on your credit report , each creditor’s address should be listed on the credit report. however, if one is not listed, then you should contact the credit reporting agency and ask for the address. , try to find whatever documents you can that support your position that the item is erroneous. for example, if the creditor claims that you missed a payment, then find cancelled checks or statements that show payment. if you requested that a credit card be closed, look for any letters from the credit card company to that effect. you may also have loan modification documents, which show that you were not foreclosed on. , open a blank word processing document to begin your letter. you should insert your address first, aligning it on the left-hand margin. after typing the address, move down two lines and enter the date.two lines underneath the date, you should enter the creditor’s address. , if you know the name of a contact person, then you can use it. otherwise, you should simply type “dear sir or madam” and add a colon afterwards., in the first paragraph, make sure to explicitly state why you are writing. for example, you can type “i am writing to dispute the following information in my file. i have highlighted the items i wish to dispute on the attached copy of my credit report.”, in the second paragraph, you can identify what items you want the creditor to investigate. also request that the creditor remove the item from your report. you can write, “the item listing ‘60 days past due’ is inaccurate because i paid my account within the 30-day period. i am requesting that you remove the item to correct the information.”, in the third paragraph, tell the creditor what documents you have enclosed that support your position. be sure to send photocopies as the creditor probably will not return originals. if you do not have any supporting documentation, then you can skip this step. sample language: “enclosed are copies of three cancelled checks that cover the period in question. please reinvestigate this matter and delete the disputed item as soon as possible.”, end the letter with “sincerely,” and then space down three lines before typing your",

time, you may find it useful to look at a restaurant’s website for a menu and prices. be sure to ask a friend or your favorite bartender; word of mouth is the strongest praise available and a good place to start.; , companies like yelp, google reviews, and trip advisor offer a great resource to those who are trying to find the best restaurant. there are a number of signs to look out for on these websites on order to determine the quality of restaurant.look out for the number of stars on the review. any restaurant worth its salt will have at least three and a half stars, but ideally you should look out for four or above. read a sample of reviews to see what the pros and cons of a restaurant. reviews offer a great way to see what the best dishes as photos are often included with the reviews. be sure to check the dates of the reviews. some restaurants have changes in management so the content of the reviews may change depending on the date. , for example, if you are a vegetarian, have nut allergies, or have celiac's disease it's crucial to carefully read over the menu to see if there will be an adequate number of options. also consider calling the restaurant to see if they have any dietary substitutions that aren't listed on the menu. , while few restaurants will outright refuse you for being underdressed, it's still important to dress the part if you're eating at an upscale establishment. check out the restaurant's website to see what kind of dress code to expect. jacket required. this is generally the highest dress code restaurants will require. this means the man is expected to wear a formal jacket such as a sports coat or blazer, while a woman should wear the equivalent such as a gowns, dresses, or even pantsuits. formal attire. for restaurants requiring formal attire, this dress code can be slightly more varied than a jacket required code. women could wear cocktail dresses or more comfortable long dresses. men should still wear something like a sport coat, but nice slacks and a tucked in button-down shirt would generally be acceptable. formal-casual. many restaurants will specify something in-between the fanciest and the most low-key establishments. examples of formal-casual or casual elegant could be turtlenecks, nice sweaters, a simple black dress, button-down shirt with a light sports coat, darker colors, leather shoes, or jewelry. casual. while casual is the most relaxed requirement for dress code, it doesn't mean you should wear sweaty, ripped clothing. something as simple as a fresh t-shirt and a clean pair of jeans with sneakers is acceptable. remember to keep up basic hygiene too. casual doesn't mean you can spread body odor through the restaurant. , when you have decided on a place, make a reservation—even", "fin rot usually affects a fish’s tail fin, but can also affect other fins, such as the dorsal and pectoral fins.in the early stages of fin rot, the edge of the fin will look ragged or shredded, due to the breakdown of the fin’s protective membrane.as the disease progresses, an increasing amount of the fin will be destroyed. as more of the fin erodes away, the fin may start to resemble a semicircular bite shape.if fin rot becomes severe, the fin will erode to the point of being only a stump.a hole in the affected fin usually indicates a fungal infection, which sometimes occurs simultaneously with fin rot.be aware that you may not be able to detect fin rot until the disease is fairly advanced.; , fins affected by fin rot become discolored. if your fish has fin rot, the edges of his fins will have an uneven, fuzzy white lining—this is a very common sign of fin rot.his fins will also develop red streaks from inflammation and bleeding.the affected areas may also have white dots,which could be indicative of a fungal infection. , in its most severe stages, fin rot can affect other parts of your fish’s body. for example, your fish may develop abdominal swelling.you may also notice ulcers and lesions on different parts of your fish’s body.fin rot is a bacterial disease. when the fins become damaged, the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through the damaged area and spread the disease throughout your fish’s body., although the physical appearance of the fins is the easiest way to identify fin rot, your fish’s behavior can also give you important clues. he may become listless. he may also start rubbing against the tank’s walls or on the tank’s decorations to try to relieve his discomfort—this could actually make the disease worse by further damaging his fins.these behaviors are not specific to fin rot, but can help confirm the diagnosis if his fin damage is characteristic of this disease. , fin rot is caused by opportunistic bacteria (aeromonas, pseudomonas, flexibacter).opportunistic bacteria are usually harmless, but can cause disease under certain conditions. the opportunistic bacteria are likely already in your fish’s tank,but will not cause disease when your fish is healthy and his tank's water quality is good. other bacteria linked to fin rot are pseudomonas species and myxobacteria. , opportunistic bacteria will cause disease in your fish when some underlying condition weakens his body's defenses. poor water quality is the most common underlying condition with fin rot.for example, ammonia accumulation in your fish's tank can damage his fins, creating an entry point for the bacterianitrate—what ammonia is broken down to during the nitrogen cycle—can also accumulate in the tank and damage your fish's fins.decaying live plants and leftover food can increase ammonia and nitrate levels., stress is another common underlying condition. it weakens your fish’s immune system, which reduces his ability to fight off infection.your fish can become stressed for a number of reasons, including bullying by other fish, overcrowding, and improper human handling.water that is too cold, as well as water", "it may seem

exactly what, when or how: ~ state that scientific theories postulate that the known universe did in fact have a beginning with what is called as “the big bang”. it makes no logical sense for anyone to assert that \"absolutely nothing\" could have produced that initiating bang or anything else: \"something existed\" and \"caused that\" -- producing those things that we know of as having a beginning. , about: there was a \"beginning of things\", there was an outline of \"from-simple-to-complex-development\" in the creation of earth and life in a genesis account of creation. explains our universe far \"in advance of humanity having theories/developed or technology\" to try to form such concepts and verify scientific assertions. for instance, the bible says: “he stretches out the north over 'empty' space, and 'hangs the earth on nothing'.” (job 26:7) how would the writer four thousand years in the past (2000bc) have known that the earth is \"suspended on nothing\" -- not attached to anything, but mountains were called pillars of heaven in the poetry of job 26:11, \"the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his threatening.\", ie: mountains \"tremble and are astonished\"

interdependence/relationships and amazing elegance pervading the entire universe suggest a planner, maker, superhuman architect having unlimited knowledge and power. the minds of human beings are taking time and, perhaps, eternity to discover what the originating mind (divine mind) actually accomplished in creating the universe and all it contains. the bible says that god created mankind in his image (genesis 1: 26-27), and it is logical to realize that the human mind is able to increasingly succeed, make progress, in understanding the universe because the human mind has a resemblance of the divine mind. , jesus was recorded to have been born in bethlehem (micah 5:2) of the tribe of judah (genesis 49:10), and to have visited the temple (malachi 3:1) and to have risen from the dead (isaiah 53:11). historical sources and archaeological evidence establish the legitimacy of jesus of nazareth as an actual person to an extent comparable to that of any other notable historical figure. the books called the gospels document the life and teachings of jesus and the existence and expansion of christianity as a major religion showing christ's purpose to create free access to the all

it is not your responsibility to educate others about homeschooling, you may be asked questions from well-meaning individuals, friends, and family members. whether you are just beginning to homeschool your children or you have been homeschooling for years, you will likely find yourself having to explain your decision to others. you may decide to homeschool your child based on personal preference, religious reasons, or if you find the public schools in your area to be unsatisfactory. it can be as easy to share your reason as, \"yes, my family decided that we weren't happy with the quality of education that our kids were getting at the local elementary school so we've decided to homeschool them.\" understand that many people are curious about homeschooling because they are less familiar with homeschooling than they are with traditional public or private schooling. everyone has different reasons to homeschool. your decision to homeschool your children may be based on a very different set of circumstances or experiences than another parent’s decision.; , look for homeschooling groups or support systems in your area to feel more connected with the homeschooling community and use them as a resource. support groups are a helpful way to meet other parents who have gone through the homeschooling process before and who have useful advice for new homeschoolers.other homeschooling parents can share ways that they've confronted misconceptions about homeschooling before, which can prepare you for whenever you may face them. homeschooling groups are also valuable resources if you need advice on practical homeschooling matters, such as selecting a curriculum. finding a homeschool support group in your area has been made easy by organizations like the home school legal defense association (hslda), a homeschool advocacy group, which has sites that allow you to search for groups in your zip code., while you do not need to justify your decision to homeschool to others, you should listen to the opinions of others when you engage in conversations with them. when you share your decision with people that you care about, be open to hearing the opinions of others. while their opinions may not change your decision, their support can be invaluable to your homeschooling experience. if you receive unwanted or unsolicited advice from others about your decision to homeschool, feel free to steer the conversation away from homeschooling or end the conversation. , there is a time and place for explanation. if you run into a hostile individual who is rude or refuses to listen to your reasoning, you must know when to walk away from a situation. there may be individuals who feel strongly against your decision to homeschool and they will have their reasons for reaching that conclusion. if they cannot be respectful of your decision, you do not have to engage with them on the subject of homeschooling anymore. use reason and rationality to explain your decision, even when you're confronted with an emotional response. a simple answer like, \"this is the best decision for my family and if you cannot respect that, i don't think it's helpful for either", "environmental enrichment is very important to your cockatiel’s health and well-being. the happier he feels in his environment, the more fun you will have with him. for the times when you are away from home, leaving the television or radio on for him will keep him mentally and visually stimulated until you get home.channels that your bird might enjoy are the travel channel and discovery channel.animal planet is another good channel for your bird to watch. other than the television or radio, you could also play a cd with bird or nature sounds., as with other pets, cockatiels can become bored when playing with the same toys. giving your cockatiel a variety of toys (e.g., wooden toys, puzzler toys) will provide him with good physical and mental exercise. you do not have to spend a fortune on toys, though—rotating out the toys every few days will give him what seems like an endless array of toys from which to choose.cockatiels especially like toys they can shred and destroy. a balled-up piece of newspaper or notebook paper is perfect for your cockatiel and will save you money.cockatiels have a natural instinct to chew.select chew toys made of either wood or leather.chew toys have the added benefit of keeping your cockatiel’s beak trimmed down.foraging toys encourage your cockatiel to exhibit his natural foraging behavior. by requiring him to put in extra effort to get his food, foraging toys also provide good mental stimulation and physical exercise.rope preening toys are also available that will satisfy your cockatiel’s natural urge to preen and prevent him from feather picking and self-mutilation.comfort toys (e.g., snuggle perches) are toys that your cockatiel could snuggle up against, especially if he does not have a cage mate.exercise toys, such as swings and bungees, will provide your cockatiel with plenty of physical exercise., this will give your cockatiel a change of scenery, which would keep him visually stimulated. select a new location that is on the periphery of activity, rather than in the center of it. this would give your bird a chance to observe the different activity, but also have some peace and quiet.determine if your bird will be able to tolerate a change of scenery. if your bird is older or timid, a change in location could cause him to start feather picking., since cockatiels are such social animals, your cockatiel may be happier if he has a cage mate with whom he can interact.if you spend a lot of time away from home, providing your cockatiel with a cage mate will keep him entertained and busy while you are not home. make sure that the new bird is well socialized and friendly.be mindful that you will need to have frequent interaction with both birds.having two birds in the same cage could have its downsides. for example, the birds could start to exhibit aggressive behavior. also, when the birds reach reproductive maturity, they may begin to start feather picking because of hormonal stress.if your bird is older and has become accustomed to the solitary life, giving him a cage mate", "there are near millions of books out there in the world and can be found in many libraries, bookstores, and even online. choose a book that is age-appropriate for your listener and a book you know they'll enjoy from their passions, interests, hobbies, or favorite type of story such as fairy tales, action plots, romantic stories, horror books, etc. avoid books that wouldn't be suitable for them. for example, reading a kid-themed fairy tale to an adult probably wouldn't be a good idea. reading a complicated algebra book wouldn't be a smart choice for a five year old child. ; , read the story aloud and then translate the story into sign language using your hands. make sure that the listener can see you clearly and that your hands are visible in sight. if the book has images or illustrations, lift the book so they're able to see them. use one hand for signing and the other book for holding onto the book. if you need both hands to sign, consider placing the book against any object so the book can hold itself. another method is having the listener can hold the book and being next to them to read and sign. it's unnecessary to mouth the words of the story. most deaf and hard of hearing adults and teenagers can read lips and follow along as you sign. for a child who has a hearing impairment, mouthing the words will prevent them for learning how to read lips from other people. avoid wearing any excessive jewelry on your hands or arms while you sign as this can be distracting and bothersome to the person when they try to enjoy the story. keep a consistent pace while you read. don't try to rush through reading or signing. the more important thing is to sign each letter at a consistent rhythm, but not bouncing it, so that the person can easily distinguish a pause. it's better to go slow and steady than to rush and suddenly pause when you can't remember a sign - the reader may misinterpret this as the beginning of a new word. , ensure that the book is easy to see so the listener can see the written words, images, illustrations, diagrams, graphs, bullet points, and/or other added information into the book. it may help to have a pointer tool to show important information clearly. this can be useful if you're reading to a class or a group of hearing impaired people, or if you're trying to present information to them. , just like a hearing person, there will be some parts of a story the person may not understand clearly. whenever a new action takes place in the story, pause for a minute and try to summarize what's going on in your own words by using sign language. to help know their understanding of the story so far, you can ask questions such as \"what do you think of character so far? she seems to be pretty lonely, huh?\" you can also have them predict what will happen", "in order to buy a hotel, you'll need to put together as much money as you can for a down payment. in addition, you'll need money to close the sale and run the hotel until it begins returning profits to you. how much you'll need for each of these expenses will depend on the value of the property and your business model. start by compiling money from your savings and investment accounts. don't worry if you don't have a lot of money saved in those accounts; there are plenty of other sources of financing you can use.you can also take out a home equity line of credit (heloc), take out a second mortgage, use a personal credit card, or ask for loans from friends and family to get more startup money.for example, imagine that you have saved up $47,500 in various accounts. in addition, you are able to take out a second mortgage for $100,000. finally, you secure a $20,000 loan from a friend. this would give you $167,500 total to invest in your hotel.; , you may also be able to get investment money out of your retirement account. however, this will incur penalties depending on your age and the type of account. for example, any money you take out of an ira will be taxed as income (at your regular income tax rate) and, if you are under 59.5 years of age, will also suffer a 10 percent penalty.you should also take into consideration that if your hotel fails, you will have little or no money left in your retirement account to use later in life. imagine that you are 35 years and decide to take some money out an ira to add to your hotel investment amount. you decide to take out $50,000. this withdrawal would be penalized for 10 percent of its value, or $5,000, and taxed at your income tax rate. assuming an income tax rate of 25 percent, you would be left with $32,500 ($50,000*(1-(0.10 + 0.25)))after the penalty and taxes. this would give you a total investable amount of $200,000 ($167,500 from earlier plus the $32,500 from the ira). , you will be able to increase your investment amount if you can find other partners to go in with you. ask friends and family if they are willing to make a more sizable investment in your business in exchange for equity (a share of the business's ownership and profits). you may also be able to find partners in local investment clubs or online. , a good rule of thumb is to set aside 25 percent of your investment money to pay for other costs. these costs include closing costs with the seller, legal costs (for the purchase contract), and working capital used to begin running the hotel. subtract this money from your investment amount and use the remainder to make a down payment.for the previous example, this means that you would set aside $50,000 (0.25*$200,000). this leaves you with $150,000 for a down payment. , your price range will depend on how much a down", "one of the main causes of nausea is simply having an illness. a flu bug, stomach ailment, or other illnesses can be a major cause of nausea. /images/thumb/5/5a/cure-nausea-step-16-version-6.jpg/v4-550px-cure-nausea-step-16-version-6.jpg

narrow down why the nausea is happening. was it something you ate that turned bad? food poisoning is surprisingly common. check with other members of your household--if all of your roommates have stomachaches after eating dinner last night, it may be due to food poisoning. if you keep having issues more than a couple of days, it is possible that you may have a gastro-intestinal issue that goes beyond a \"stomach bug\". there are a lot of medical reasons nausea happens, from simple to severe. a trip to your general practitioner may be in order. severe and prolonged nausea may even be a reason to go to the er (as discussed more in-depth below.) , if you have frequent bouts of nausea, keep a journal for a couple weeks to see if you can find a pattern that points to the culprit. if you suspect food intolerance or other reactions, avoid or limit the food and talk to your doctor. /images/thumb/9/97/cure-nausea-step-17-version-6.jpg/v4-550px-cure-nausea-step-17-version-6.jpg /images/thumb/9/97/cure-nausea-step-17-version-6.jpg/v4-300px-cure-nausea-step-17-version-6.jpg lactose intolerance is a common cause of nausea. the ability to digest milk comfortably as an adult is mostly limited to people of european descent, and even then many are lactose-intolerant. use over-the-counter medications like lactaid or dairy ease to help you digest dairy items, or stick with milk products in which are processed by enzymes, such as yogurt and cheese. food sensitivities or even allergies can be another issue. if you notice that you feel queasy shortly after eating strawberries or foods with strawberry, this may be an indicator of this problem. food sensitivity and intolerance can only be definitively diagnosed by a qualified medical specialist. it has become trendy in some regions for people to self-identify as \"gluten intolerant\" and the like without any sort of medical testing. be careful of such fads. there are some people who react horribly to gluten. but sometimes the \"cure\" is due to a placebo effect or simply a person feeling better after a period of time, and ascribing the \"cure\" to the diet change when in fact it is unclear that it was the diet change, or the fact the body simply healed. , before introducing more drugs into your system to treat the nausea, you should first make sure that the source itself isn’t one of the medications you’re already on. many drugs, like codeine or hydrocodone, can cause nausea and vomiting.if you suffer from ongoing nausea, talk to your doctor about whether any of your medications list it as a side effect. he or she may be able to suggest an alternate medication or a lower dosage. /images/thumb/9/90/cure-nausea-step-18-version-6.jpg/v4-550px-cure-nausea-step-18-version-6.jpg

the wet ingredients. turn off the mixer as soon as the dry ingredients are incorporated. if you mix the dough too long, your cookies will be hard and tough.avoid mixing the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients on a medium or high speed. mixing on low ensures that you don't over mix the dough and it keeps the dry ingredients from being beaten out of the bowl. , add 1/3 cups (30 g) of

across the guitar, can guide you throw 90% of the songs thrown your way. if a song is in the key of c-major, you have the entire c-major scale at your disposal. the following scale is for a-major, but you simply start it on whatever note you want to put it in the key of this note. bolded notes are the roots, or the two a notes. g|-----5----6---7---| d|-----5----6---7---| a|--4--5--------7---| e|------5--------7---|, the minor scale generally has a \"darker\" or more \"moody tone to it. the a-minor scale located below is a good fit for songs in a-minor. again, bolded notes indicate root notes. g|--4--5-------7------| d|------5-------7------| a|------5-------7--8--| e|------5-------7--8--|, this handy trick will double the number of notes at your disposal when playing songs, though it is important to note that they still have different feels. to find the notes, take the major scale in the key you're playing, for example, the a major shown above. if you start a minor scale on the second note of the major scale, in this case the 7th fret b, all of these notes will fit in your song as well! otherwise put, a song in a-major can use either the a-major scale or the b-minor scale. this relationship holds up and down the fretboard. , for example, you could play just a, e, and d if the chords are a7, e7, and d7. but you could also play some of those 7th notes, which simply mean the 7th note in the associated scale. so, if the guitarist is playing an a7, you can also hit the 7th not in the a-major scale (2nd string, 6th fret) to sound amazing. if you're struggling with the numbers, just ask the guitarist to show you the chord. all the notes he's playing on his top four strings will match the notes on your four strings., many bassists can play 10 notes and sound good, but only the best players can play one note and make it sound amazing. bass is a very physical instrument, and your ability to handle and manipulate the strings is how you wring emotion and power out of every note: vibrato: keeping your finger on the string, shake your hand up and down. you should hear the note \"waving\" based on how high or far you shake the string. bends: with your finger on the fret, use 2-3 fingers to push the string up the neck. you should hear the note's pitch change as you bend the string. you can also pull the string downward, too. slides: play a note and, without taking your hand off the string, slide down to the next note you want to play, fluidly transitioning down. hammer-ons: instead of plucking a note, slam your finger down on the string at the fret you want, sounding it out with just this hand. pull-offs: when removing your finger from a fret, use your fretting hand to pluck the string instead of coming straight off., if you stick", "a warm,

mixture into the sugar mixture, and beat well until combined. stir in half of the evaporated milk. repeat with the remaining flour mixture and evaporated milk., gently fold the sour cream into the batter using a rubber spatula. be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl., check the cake for doneness after 25 minutes be poking a toothpick into the center. if the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is ready. if the toothpick has crumbs on it, bake the cake for 5 to 10 more minutes., allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes first, then carefully flip it over onto another sheet of parchment paper. peel away the parchment paper from the bottom (if necessary), and discard it. , you can do this using a cake splitting tool, a long knife, or a piece of thread. if you are using a pre-baked sheet cake, check the thickness; you may have to split it into thirds instead. if you are using a pre-baked pound cake, cut it into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) thick slices. , keep the top half of the cake on the cardboard, and set it aside for now. if you don't have any thin cardboard on hand, you can also use a thin cutting matt instead., you can also use a different type of jam, such as strawberry or blueberry. you could also use lemon curd. try to use something tart or sour tasting; this will help balance out the overall sweetness. if you split your pre-baked sheet cake into thirds, repeat this step for the middle layer. if you are using a pound cake cut into thin slices, coat only half of the slices; reserve the other half for the top. , you don't absolutely have to do this, but there is nothing wrong with extra frosty goodness. make sure that the frosting goes from edge to edge, corner to corner. do not use your icing for this step; use buttercream frosting instead. cream cheese buttercream or vanilla buttercream work especially well. you can use homemade buttercream or you can use store-bought buttercream. if you split your pre-baked sheet cake into thirds, repeat this step for the middle layer.", "there are two main parts that make up the device: the leads, which are thin wire electrodes attached to your heart that monitor the rhythm, and the generator (often referred to as the actual icd), which provides and delivers the electricity during a shock. most icds also have a pacemaker function, as well. the electrodes are attached to your heart, either in one or both ventricles, and continuously monitor the electrical impulses of the heart. when it detects a potentially life-threatening rhythm (arrhythmia), the icd will provide one of three possible treatments: cardioversion: giving a shock at a specific time during the cardiac cycle to try to convert the arrhythmia to a normal sinus rhythm (nsr). defibrillation: shocking a large mass of the heart muscle to depolarize it, reset the cells (therefore, terminating the arrhythmia), and allow the sa node to reestablish nsr. this procedure is often depicted in the media with paddles/pads and the patient violently jerking. pacing: using the built-in pacemaker, a series of short bursts of electricity are given in time with the heartbeat to slow it down. ; , people who survive cardiac arrests, have been diagnosed with an arrhythmia, and are at a high risk of sudden cardiac death are often candidates for an icd implantation. survivors of heart attacks may also get icds. the two arrhythmias that icds treat originate from the ventricles of the heart. these are: ventricular tachycardia (v-tach/vt): an abnormally fast heart rate (over 100 beats per minute). this is treated with cardioversion if a pulse is found. however, if left untreated, it could degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (see below). ventricular fibrillation (v-fib/vf): the heart muscle is uncontrollably contracting, making the heart quiver rather than pump blood. it is an extremely dangerous arrhythmia because blood flow to the brain is stopped, depriving it from oxygen. this is treated with defibrillation. however, if left untreated for more than a few seconds, it's likely to degenerate into asystole (\"flatline\"); brain damage and even death occurs if this continues for more than 5 minutes. before the procedure, make sure that you fully understand your condition and the reason why an icd is needed. ask your doctors, read pamphlets, or even talk to other patients who have icds. , do all such actions with your other hand. , although your lifestyle will remain unchanged, there are a few considerations you'll have to make. for example, you may have to adjust your seat belt shoulder harness if the icd was implanted in your upper chest. if you find an item of clothing creates pressure around your upper chest, you may have to stop wearing it. adjust your lifestyle according to such things becoming apparent to you when going about your normal activities. , when you're having any procedure done, tell your doctor, dentist, or other health care professional about your icd. since it's made of metal, the icd may set off metal detectors and other security devices found in airports and other places. show your card to security personnel––keep it

you'll be gone.double check the date of your procedure. have your doctor verify how long the recovery will be, and how much time you'll need off work. make sure your sick leave falls within the appropriate restrictions of your company's policy. , business letters follow a specific format. a medical leave letter is not different. before writing your letter, make sure it is formatted correctly.write down your company's address at the top of the letter. below this, write the date in the format month, date, and year. for example, \"june 5th, 2016.\" when you begin the letter, start with a salutation that begins with \"dear.\" then, write your boss's name using his or her preferred personal title (e.g., mr., mrs., etc.). , your introductory paragraph need not be long. you simply need to write the reason for writing the letter, why you need a leave of absence, and the dates you'll be absent from work. as your boss is likely busy, keep this letter brief and to the point.you can begin with something like, \"i am writing this letter to ask for a leave of absence from work for medical reasons. according to company policy, i am entitled to 10 days of medical absence a year.\" from there, state the medical concerns and the dates when you'll be absent. for example, \"i am having my gallbladder removed. my surgery is on thursday the 16th, and i will require 7 days of recovery. i should be back to work by the following thursday, the 23rd.\" , if you have an unusual medical condition, it may be necessary to explain. something like maternity leave is largely self-explanatory, but more unusual reasons for medical leave may require some explanation. this can help your boss see why your leave is necessary. you do not need to provide a lot of details, but a", "facial cleanser is important for great skin. ditch the bar of soap and get a good quality face wash to start your makeup routine. fill your bathroom basin with lukewarm water and splash some on your face (this is also great for waking you up in the morning) and then squeeze pea size amounts of facial wash on to your hand and massage it into your face with circular motions and then rinse it off with the water and pat your face dry with a towel.; , get a little cotton pad and put a little bit of the toner onto it and then wipe it all over your face. this leaves your face cool and refreshed while evening out your complexion and removing any dirt your cleanser has missed. , find a moisturiser that's good for your skin type. most skin care brands make a moisturiser for all types of skin. dab bits of moisturiser on your cheeks, nose, chin and forehead then with the excess in your hand, rub your hands together with circular motions and massage the moisturiser on to your skin. sometimes you might want to apply a cream at night. to do this, get a little bit on your ring finger and pat it under your eye. , this will help your make-up to stay on all day. just apply it like you would apply your moisturiser. , find a foundation that matches your skin tone perfectly. if you can't, then go for a shade lighter. put just little onto the back of your hand, then with a foundation brush start applying it around the nose than work outwards, only use a little because it's easier to apply more than to remove it. make sure it is properly blended so that it does not look like you're wearing anything on your face. , find one that brightens for under your eyes. you can either use a brush or your finger. if you're using a brush, put a little concealer on your hand then dab the brush in it and use light feathery strokes to apply it under your eyes, around your nose and on any blemishes. if you are using your finger do the exact same thing but try to pat it in as that will give better coverage. , pressed powder usually gives a bit more coverage than loose powder. use a big fluffy brush and apply just a little on your face to set your make-up. , blusher gives you a rosy glow on your cheeks. bronzer gives you defined cheekbones and a sun-kissed glow. apply it with a fluffy angled brush; either apply it where the sun would normally hit (your cheeks, forehead, and nose) or apply it in the hollows of your cheekbones to give yourself a more sculptured face. for blush, you can either apply it on the apples of your cheeks or just below your cheekbones all the way up to your hairline. , any color of eyeshadow that is flattering for your skin and eyes will do. if you choose", "some of the early game resources, especially seeds, grass, berries, mushrooms, and rabbits, are easily renewable without difficulty. bigger, more substantial and important resources (like meat, pig skins, silk, and beefalo fur) can be a bit more difficult to farm, but are definitely worth it. some are only available in certain places, like monster meat, gems cave bananas, tentacle spikes, fish, and frog legs. so before everything else, consider what you want to farm or what you consider to be most important to farm, since this will determine where your base camp will be. at most, a few “food” structures, some way to get manure, and some other surface resources (like saplings and grass tufts) would be enough to ensure your continued, self-sustaining survival for several weeks at a time, even in winter. more advanced builds include sustainable farming in rarer or more uncommon in hazardous places, such as marshes, caves and ruins, and it’s only advisable if the player prepares themselves to farm there with a clear safety net in close reach, like a touch stone or a meat effigy.; , before getting hyped up to make a sprawling, complicated farm, consider first if your materials are easily renewable at this point. for example, bees and honey are infinitely renewable as long as there’s a hive or a bee box, but honeycomb, which you get from destroying bee hives, are not. you can dig up saplings, berry bushes, and grass tufts and replant them, but while their resources are renewable every 4 days, the objects themselves are not. gold is infinitely renewable if you go down the caverns and wait for an earthquake, or find a pig king to give meat to, but most gravedigger items, like gnomes, gears, and hardened rubber bungs are not renewable. the only renewable items you get from digging up graves are gems, life giving amulets, and nightmare fuel, since they can be found and made elsewhere. checking the wiki for the complete list is advisable for the new or unsure players, but generally speaking, if it’s a treasure, or if you can’t plant it or raise it, you usually can’t renew it. thulecite and gems (green, yellow, or orange) are very rare resources in the ruins and aren’t reliably renewed. however, in reign of giants, they have a chance to be found in tumbleweeds, making them renewable. same with the most gravedigger items and fireflies. , the best area to camp in is a grasslands with all the other biomes within a few seconds to a minute away from you. this will give you a wide area to place your base in, and the grasslands also provide you with some easy resources you can relocate to your camp with a shovel. if not, look for places with a concentration of your prefered resources. for example, if you want to farm fish and frog legs, scout out a grassland area full of ponds. if you want to farm beefalo for their fur, meat, and manure, check out a savannah full of them. if you make a", "partners to play canasta can be chosen and the dealer determined by drawing cards from a spread deck as in contract bridge, with the 2 highest draws and 2 lowest draws partnering, and the highest draw choosing the dealer. , you will be working with 2 decks (both with jokers). the remaining 64 cards become the draw pile, or stock. , this card forms the discard pile, or pack. players may, in turn, draw the top card from either the stock or the pack. if a player takes the top card from the discard pile, he also takes the cards underneath it. throughout the game, you see cards come and go that you want. you'll have to determine whether taking the whole pile is worth the few cards you want. if the card turned over is a red 3 (3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds) or a wild card (joker or deuce), the discard pile cannot be taken (it's \"frozen\"). , a turn consists of drawing a card from the draw pile or taking the discard pile, attempting to create or add to an existing meld and discarding a card (unless the player has no cards left after melding). as discussed previously, a meld consists of 3 or more cards of the same rank (e.g., all kings, all jacks, all 10s). no more than 3 of the cards in a meld can be wild cards (jokers or deuces), and wild cards cannot be melded by themselves. a meld of 7 or more cards is a canasta; each team must complete at least 1 canasta before its players have gotten rid of all the cards in their hands (gone out). red 3s (3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds) cannot be included in a meld, and black 3s (3 of spades, 3 of clubs) can only be melded by themselves  but only if this permits the player to go out. players can add only to their own or their partner's melds, not to an opponent's meld. a player can take the discard pile instead of drawing a card from the discard pile only if he or she can use the pile's top card in a new or existing meld in that turn. a player can prevent the next player from taking the discard pile by discarding a black 3 or wild card to end his or her turn. , each card has a point value, as described below. the first meld must be 50 points. as the scores progress, the first meld's value increases. if a team's total score is from 0 to 1,495 points, their initial meld must be worth at least 50 points. if their total is from 1,500 to 2,995, it must be worth at least 90. if their total is over 3,000, it must be worth at least 120. (however, if the team has a negative score, the minimum is reduced to 15.) only the top card from the discard pile, if it is taken to make the initial meld, may be counted toward making the minimum. until a", "tsh stands for \"thyroid stimulating hormone,\" which is created by the pituitary gland and stimulates the thyroid to create and release hormones t4 and t3. tsh can be thought of as the metaphorical \"engine\" of the thyroid gland, in that it determines the amount of thyroid hormone that is synthesized and then released from the thyroid into the body. a normal value for tsh is between 0.4 – 4.0 miu/l.if your tsh is in this range, that is a good sign; however, a normal tsh value does not completely rule out thyroid problems. tsh values on the high end of normal can indicate potential thyroid problems that are evolving. most thyroid problems require two or more tests to detect and diagnose, given the complex interplay of the various hormones that contribute to thyroid function. your doctor may order more tests, even if your tsh is normal, if he still suspects that you may have a thyroid problem.; , if your thyroid is underactive, then it is not releasing enough much t4 and t3, and so your pituitary gland will release more tsh to try and compensate. thus, a high tsh may be a sign of hypothyroidism (a condition in which your thyroid gland is producing insufficient amounts of hormones). you will need further testing, however, to further investigate and to confirm such a diagnosis. , tell your doctor if you are experiencing any of the following signs or symptoms, which may be suspicious for hypothyroidism: increased cold sensitivity fatigue unexplained weight gain unusually dry skin constipation muscle aches and stiffness joint pain and swelling depression and/or other mood changes a slower than normal heart rate thinning hair changes to your menstrual cycle slowed thinking or speaking , as such, a low tsh may be an indication of hyperthyroidism (excess production of thyroid hormone). again, further blood tests will be required to confirm such a diagnosis. a tsh reading alone can point your physician down a certain path, but in itself it is usually not diagnostic. , tell your doctor if you are experiencing any of the following signs or symptoms that may be indicative of hyperthyroidism: a faster than normal heart rate unexplained weight loss increased appetite sweating a tremor, often in your hands anxiety, irritability, and/or other mood changes fatigue more frequent bowel movements an enlarged thyroid gland (which can be felt in your neck, and is called a \"goiter\") trouble sleeping eyes that bulge or protrude more than they normally do (this sign is present in a certain type of hyperthyroidism called grave's disease — specifically, the eye abnormality is called \"grave's ophthalmopathy\") , ongoing monitoring can also ensure that your tsh level is within the target range. the treatment for hypothyroid and hyperthyroid conditions are very different. the target range for thyroid treatment is normally a tsh between 0.4.–4.0 miu/l, although this may vary depending upon the type of thyroid disorder you have. you will likely receive more frequent monitoring at the start of your treatment, until you settle into a routine where your tsh becomes quite consistent (at", "most children do not whine to annoy or anger you. they may be feeling tired, hungry, stressed, or uncomfortable, or they may just want attention. stopping to put yourself in your child’s shoes may help you understand the causes of the whining, and then you will be better able to take preventative measures.; , fatigue can contribute to a number of undesirable behaviors, including whining. aim for an appropriate amount of sleep each night, and consider an earlier bedtime if you notice a lot of crankiness and whining. if your child is preschool-aged or younger, make sure he or she gets an afternoon nap; if your child is elementary-school-aged, give him or her a chance to rest and relax after school. children’s individual sleep needs vary, but in general, toddlers between one and three years of age need a total of twelve to fourteen hours a day (including naptime). three to six year olds need ten to twelve hours a day, and seven to twelve year olds still need ten to eleven hours. , hunger makes children uncomfortable and cranky, and it tends to trigger bad behaviors like whining. many children need small, nutritious snacks between meals, so don’t expect your child to last from lunch to dinner with nothing to eat. for best results, offer a combination of protein, whole grains, and produce: a few whole-grain crackers with peanut butter and a banana, for example. , children tend to whine when you tell them to do something they do not want to do. minimize this problem by offering a warning in advance, rather than suddenly springing something unpleasant on your child. say, “we’ll have to leave the playground in ten minutes” or “you’ll have to get ready for bed after one more story.” when children know what to expect, they are generally better able to adjust. , children often struggle to tolerate being bored; they then whine because they want attention and don’t know how to cope with boredom. if you have a whiny child, try to offer plenty of engaging age-appropriate activities. whenever possible, some of these activities should take place outdoors, where children can burn excess energy more easily. if you are noticing issues related to boredom, whining, and decreased attention spans, consider eliminating (or at least minimizing) the time your child spends watching television or playing with electronic devices. these activities may occupy your child and prevent whining in the short term, but they may exacerbate the problem in the long term, leaving your child unable to occupy himself without cartoons or video games. , when children feel ignored, they often whine to get your attention. you may be able to prevent this by spending quality time with your child, even just in small moments, throughout the day. parents are so busy that doing so can be difficult, but try: sitting with your child and having a conversation while he or she eats breakfast stopping for a moment to admire your child’s drawing, block tower, or other creative project taking a ten-minute break from whatever you are doing", "each form has its own organizational structure. you will base your debate outline on that structure. there are two common forms used in schools and competitions. other forms are simply varieties of these two, changing the amount of time available and the organization of different segments. team debates are one of the most common debate forms. in the first half of the debate, each team has two segments to present arguments for their side. in the second half of the debate, each team has two segments to rebut arguments presented in the first half. lincoln-douglas debates are set up to allow one side to present their arguments, and then the other team to cross-examine them. the second team then presents their arguments and has the first team cross-examine them. finally, each team has an opportunity for a final rebuttal.; , whatever form your debate takes, you will have the opportunity to present your side of the issue. gather all of your research and look for common arguments. on a piece of paper, list different pieces of evidence under each line of argument. this can include quotes, examples, cases, facts, and statistics. be sure to note all bibliographical information on your notes. use the best research at your disposal, not just the first entries on google, in order to find solid evidence. visit the library and look for peer-reviewed journals for a good selection of research. for every supporting piece of evidence you find for your case, try to find another piece of evidence to counter it. this will help you build your argument later. it is better to include more points than you think you will need, than not doing enough research and lacking evidence. , while the order of your material will be determined by your debate form, the format for your debate outline should follow the basic guidelines for outlining. if you are doing your debate for a class, you were likely presented with a rubric which you should be making sure you are following. subdivide information. main headings will probably consist of arguments, while subheadings will contain different pieces of supporting evidence. use correct symbols. each level of the outline has a particular symbol to use. the main headings will use roman numerals (i, ii, iii, iv). subheadings use capital letters (a, b, c). sub-sub headings use arabic numerals (1, 2, 3). keep these consistent throughout your outline. indent each level. indentation helps you follow the line of argument and keeps your outline organized. , your case is your primary argument: the value you are trying to uphold through a variety of evidence. start the outline of your debate by compiling a list of evidence that supports your case. order it so that the most influential and powerful evidence is the first to be presented, mediocre evidence is in the middle, and a final powerful piece is at the end.if you have a fairly lengthy debate planned, break up your case evidence into categorical sections. for example, you could have legal, moral, and economic support for your case. aim", "depending on where you live, there may be many karate teachers or very few near you. in rural areas, it may be difficult to find someone proficient enough in this martial art to sufficiently guide you. if you live in a highly populated area, you may have to pick a good teacher from among many. the most important part of this process is to find a teacher that works well to motivate your development and who is capable of teaching you advanced skills. a karate teacher can be called “senpai”, “sensei”, “renshi”, “shihan”, “kyoshi”, or “hanshi”. senpai is used for anyone who is your senior. sensei gets used for any teacher. renshi is a title that is independent of rank, and is commonly used to refer to teachers.shihan designates an expert teacher, but has little meaning outside of its organizational meaning.kyoshi is used for a person in the 7th and 8th dan. hanshi refers to a master teacher, one who instructs instructors. this title means they have attained the 9th or 10th dan. ; , you'll never make it as a karate teacher if you haven't mastered your skill. anyone can buy a black belt and pretend. it is another thing altogether to earn it. karate practitioners are considered to be proficient once they've earned a black belt. this is called the 1st dan. it requires a person to be 15 years old and have undergone three years of training. kyus are the lower levels in karate. these represent students who have not yet attained the first dan. a person who holds a kyu rank is called a mudansha. kyu rank color belts start with white and end with brown. dans are the levels of mastery. there are ten. however, only the first 8 are attainable without recognition from an international governing body (there are many, and they correspond to the style of karate you choose). a person who holds the dan rank is called a yudansha. this is commonly what people mean when they say, “i have a black belt in karate.”, you must continually work to hone your skills. if you do not practice, you will not be very good. no one will want to learn karate from a teacher that performs poorly. by practicing regularly, you make sure your skills are sharp for your students., there are some differences between the major styles of karate, however the major difference is the location where they were practiced. each one is named after a city. there is no way to determine which style of karate is best for any individual. in order to figure out which one you like best, try them all. shuri-te is from shuri in okinawa. naha-te is from naha in okinawa. tomari-te is from tomari in okinawa. shotokan is practiced more commonly on mainland japan. , this will earn you notoriety and titles. there are two major components of typical karate exhibitions: kata and kumitejiai. by competing in one or both of these categories, you will enhance your skills and standing within the community. find out about", "not all bird species are appropriate as pets and not all bird temperaments or care needs will suit what you're able to provide. it is very important to learn as much as you can about the species of birds that interest you, well before deciding which bird you will choose. the bird must match your lifestyle, interests and ability to take good care of it for the time it lives (which can a very long time for some birds). you must be willing to interact with the bird and provide daily interaction, as well as supervising time outside of the cage, where possible. don't buy a bird on impulse. you need the time to research the bird's needs and longevity before bringing one home. check out books on birds or read online articles on bird species and specific bird requirements, to learn more about the different types of bird species.; , parrots, cockatiels and cockatoos, or parakeets tend to be some of the most popular types of birds owned as pets. other good pet species include: canaries, finches, lovebirds, doves and pigeons. the more exotic or less common the bird type, the more consideration you need to give as to whether it is one you can provide appropriate care for. , some birds, such as parrots, live long lives, so this should be a consideration when purchasing a parrot. arrangements may have to be made to care for parrot after the owner dies; in some cases, you might consider taking on the responsibility of caring for a bird in such a predicament rather than getting a young one. , some birds will be able to share housing, while others might not get along; indeed, \"cage mate trauma\" is commonplace and can depend on such issues as personalities, size differences, gender and species.although it will depend on the species, you might be able to house two boys or two girls or a boy and girl. if they fight, you'll need to separate them. do plenty of research beforehand and ask questions of the breeder or retailer; you could even talk to bird keepers at your local zoo or wildlife refuge for advice. there are often special methods needed for introducing a new bird to a cage with an existing bird. talk to a veterinarian or bird expert for advice. , the cage required will vary by type of bird; as such, be guided by the species you're choosing. that said, some fairly standard requirements include: the cage size should be sufficient for the bird to stretch its wings from side to side. for some birds, being able to fly short distances within the cage may be an important part of ensuring it has a healthy living space. at a minimum, large birds should only be housed in a cage that is one and a half times the height of the bird's wingspan (depth, width and height).the cage bars should not be too small; the bird's talons might get caught on or in them if the bar wires or lengths are too small. equally,", "keep your phone out of sight. even if it's just your mom texting what you want for dinner or your friend asking to meet up after class, once you see your screen light up, your concentration is broken.it’s too easy to get lost in facebook updates and game notifications. put your phone in your bag and only check it on your breaks. even if you just glance at your phone to see your friend’s message, “what are we doing tonight?”, you’re going to start thinking about your plans and miss what your teacher is saying. , as you know, summer school is a condensed version of a class that is normally a semester or even a year long. your teacher will be cramming a ton of information into each class—in some cases, missing one day can be equivalent to several days, a week, or even two weeks of school.your school probably has a policy that if you miss a certain number of days, the course won’t count, and you’ll have wasted your time (and money—they probably won’t refund the cost of the class, either). make sure you arrive on time to your classes as well. some schools will count excessive tardies as absences (so being late four times might count as an absence). too many tardies or absences and you may lose credit for the course. , if you already know people in your class, that’s great! otherwise, try introducing yourself to the person sitting next to you and ask to exchange numbers. now you have someone to contact when you’re confused about homework or due dates, a possible study buddy, and maybe even a friend you’ll keep after school is over.if you make friends in your class, it’s going to make it a little easier to get through the day. you’ll have someone to commiserate with during lunch and an automatic partner on any group work. , when you’re trying to focus, the last thing you need to be worrying about is hunger pangs or a lack of energy. bring some “brain food” to class so you can stay focused. bring some squares of dark chocolate, which provides energy in the form of caffeine and antioxidants that increase brain function.walnuts or other foods with omega 3’s improve concentration and help your brain process information.blueberries can improve your short term memory. bring these for snack or to eat at lunch.make sure you stay hydrated, too. dehydration can affect your concentration and memory and can make you tired and moody, too., it may count toward your grade, for one thing, but participating in class can also make lectures more interesting. if you are participating in class, you must listen and think critically about the material. it will keep you alert and engaged.studies show that by hearing, seeing, and participating, you are more likely to remember and understand the material than if you are passive.don’t be afraid of answering incorrectly. it’s better to get something wrong when your teacher can help guide you toward the right answer than getting it wrong on a test.", "contact emergency services. that way, even if you have to deliver the baby yourself, help will arrive soon if you experience complications. the dispatcher should also be able to either talk you through the delivery or connect you to someone who can. if the mother has a doctor or midwife, call that person too. the medical professional can often stay on the phone and help guide you through the process.; , the first stage of labor is called the “latent” stage, where the body is getting ready to deliver by dilating the cervix. it can take a long time, especially if this is the woman's first child.the second, or “active” stage occurs when the cervix has completely dilated.women may not experience as much pain or discomfort during this stage as later stages. if the woman is fully dilated and you can see the baby's head crowning, she's in stage two. wash your hands, skip to the next section and get ready to catch the baby. unless you have been trained to do so, don't try to examine the cervix. just watch to see if the head begins to appear. , time the contractions from the beginning of one to the beginning of the next, and note how long they last. the further along labor is, the more regular, stronger, and closer together contractions become.here's what you need to know about contractions: contractions that are 10 minutes apart or less are a sign that the mother has entered labor.physicians recommend that you contact the hospital when contractions are 5 minutes apart and last 60 seconds, and this activity has been going for an hour.if this is the case, you probably have time to make it to the hospital if you live close to one. first-time mothers are likely to give birth when contractions are three to five minutes apart and last 40 to 90 seconds, increasing in strength and frequency for at least an hour.if the contractions are two minutes or less apart, buckle down and get ready to deliver the baby, especially if the mother's had other children and they were fast labors. also, if the mother feels like she's going to have a bowel movement, the baby is probably moving through the birth canal, creating pressure on the rectum, and is on its way out. if the baby is preterm, you should contact the mother's physician and emergency services at any signs of labor. , remove any jewelry, such as rings or watches. wash your hands thoroughly with antimicrobial soap and warm water. scrub your arms all the way up to your elbows. if you have the time, wash your hands for five minutes; if you don’t have time for that, wash them thoroughly for at least one minute.remember to scrub in between your fingers and under your nails. use a nail brush or even a toothbrush to clean under your nails.wear sterile gloves if available. don’t wear things like dishwashing gloves, which are likely loaded with bacteria. to finish (or if you don't have access to soap and water), use", "look at this sentence: \"the thief smashed the window.\" the red section, \"the thief,\" is the subject of the sentence, or the one doing the action. the purple section, \"smashed,\" is the verb, or action. the blue section, \"the window,\" is the object: something is happening to it. keep reading for more explanation, and look back at this example sentence to follow along. , in an active sentence, the subject is whatever does something. it can be a person, a place, a thing, or even an idea. here are some examples, with the subject in red: every morning, the sun rises. the tall woman will brush her teeth. your bravery saved the town. , in active sentences, the verb describes what the subject does. it can also describe what the subject did in the past, or will do in the future. here are some examples, with the verb colored purple: the tree grew very tall. my enemy is planning his attack. , in many active sentence, but not all of them, an action is done to something else. here are examples, with the object colored blue: the dog ate the meat. the explorers discovered a new river. , if you're not sure whether something is the subject or object, find yourself the verb and ask yourself \"what is (verb)-ing?\" to find the subject.ask \"what is being (verb)ed?\" to find the object. here's an example of a tricky sentence, step by step: \"everything in the world irritates her.\" find the verb. the only word that describes an action is \"irritates\", so \"irritates\" must be the verb. find the subject. what is irritating? \"everything in the world\" is irritating, so the entire phrase \"everything in the world\" is the subject. find the object. what is being irritated? the person described as \"her\" is being irritated, so \"her\" is the object. , \"the ball is thrown by the athlete.\" in this passive sentence, the subject is \"the ball\". the verb, \"was thrown\", describes what happened to the ball. the agent, the thing that did the action, is \"the athlete\"., the subject of a passive sentence is having something done to it. this can be any noun: a person, place, thing, or idea. here are some examples, with the subject written in red: this essay was written last year. the delicious dinner was cooked by a professional cook. elephants are protected from hunters by international law. , in a passive sentence, something happens to the subject. the verb is the action that happens. it begins with a \"to be\" verb (for example, \"is,\" \"was,\" \"were,\" \"has been,\" \"will have been\"), then a verb in a past tense.here are some examples with the verb colored purple: the city was destroyed by the meteor. all the ice cream had been eaten already. the music was played beautifully. , many passive sentences do not include the agent at all. if an agent is present, it describes what did the action. it usually comes at the end of the sentence, after the word \"by.\" here are some examples, with the", "you should check for the signs of a broken leg before administering any first aid. this can help you figure if your cat needs to see your vet or if there may be another issue. signs your kitten may have a broken leg include: reluctance to put weight on the leg limping swelling pain or tenderness limb deformity or unusual bends in the leg rapid breathing broken skin and/ or a visible bonenot eating or grooming crying, howling, moaning, or growling; , no matter how sweet your kitten is, it may bite or scratch you because of the injury. take great care when examining your kitten’s leg to minimize the risk of biting or scratching.maintain a safe distance between the kitten’s mouth and your face. avoid attempting to hug it. examine the leg slowly, carefully, and as gently as possible. reassure your kitten in a soft voice. stop looking for signs if your kitten becomes agitated. , once you’ve checked your kitten’s leg, call your vet’s office. explain to the office staff that your kitten may have a broken leg to get an appointment as soon as possible. if your vet isn’t available, take your kitten to an emergency clinic to ensure it gets prompt care.calling ahead can also alert the vet that you are coming so they can prepare to treat your kitten as quickly as possible. give as much information as possible about your kitten’s symptoms. ask any questions you have, such as what type of first aid to provide and the best way to transport kitten to the office. , before you take your kitten to the vet, stabilize its leg with a splint or bandage. this can reduce the risk of further injury or pain. only stabilize the leg if your kitten allows it.place a towel or blanket gently over your kitten’s head to prevent it from biting. make a splint with items such as the cardboard center of paper towel or toilet rolls, rolled up newspaper, or towels.put the splint next to the broken area. use a bandage, pantyhose, or surgical tape to keep the splint in place. add padding around the splint to reduce your kitten’s discomfort. avoid pushing any exposed bone back through the broken skin. in this case, place some sterile gauze or a sanitary napkin over the area and then splint it. , the only way to safely treat a kitten’s broken leg is with veterinary care. after you’ve stabilized the leg and informed the vet that you are coming, take your kitten to the office for treatment.wrap your kitten in a thick towel or place it on a rigid surface for the car ride.this can minimize your kitten’s discomfort the risk of further injury.place your kitten in a crate, carrier, or open box to keep it from moving around the car. put it in the back passenger side seat so that you can watch your kitten through your rearview mirror. use a seat belt around the front of the crate or carrier to secure it., you’ll need to seek prompt veterinary care", "your hair will curl most effectively if it's dry. if it's soaking wet, you'll just end up damaging your hair and the curling process won't work. it can be just a little bit damp as well. ; , you need an ordinary duel-sided flat iron to curl your hair. a 1 inch (2.5 cm) iron will be perfect for the job. just give it a minute or two to fully heat up. if it has settings, pick a setting in the middle so the iron curls your hair the right amount -- if the setting is too high, your curls may end up looking a little bit dented. , sectioning your hair can help you isolate parts of your hair. this can make it a bit easier to curl your hair, especially if there's a lot of it, but it can take longer. if you're sectioning your hair, you'll need to clip or pin back the top part of your hair so you can reach the bottom strands first. if you're not, then you can start with any of your strands. as you curl more hair, you'll be sectioning less and less of it. , you can start about 3-4 inches (7.6-10.1 cm) down your hair. if you curl it from the very top, your hair will look too poofy. , once the hair is in your iron, just fold it backward, away from your face, and hold the position for a few seconds. , now, either glide the iron down your hair or just release it and move it down 2-3 inches (5 - 7.6 cm) before you fold it forward, in the opposite direction that you folded it the last time. , continue moving the iron down and moving it forward and backward until you approach the bottom of the strand. you can leave a 2-3 inches (5 - 7.6 cm) of hair untouched at the bottom to create a natural and flowing look. , just repeat this process on all of the 1-2 inch (2.5 - 5 cm) strands of your hair until you've created beach waves on all of the strands. if you've sectioned off your hair with a clip or tie, just take more chunks of hair out of the clip until they're all down. to avoid having all of your curls clump together, you can alternate between starting by moving the iron forward first and backward first as you make your way along the strands. that way, each strand will be curled in the opposite direction. you also don't have to start curling each strand in the exact same place. when you reach the outer parts of your hair, you can clip the top part of the hair you're not ironing to the side -- so if you're curling the top-most right strand, you can clip the top left strands to the side of your head so they don't get in the way. , look at the sides of your head and put up a mirror to the back of your head to make sure that", "to make an effective cleanser to clean a stainless steel grill grate, add ¼ cup (45 g) of baking soda and ¼ cup (59 ml) of water to a small bowl. mix the two together well to form a paste.it helps to mix the baking soda with warm water so the two blend more easily together.; , once you’ve mixed up the baking soda paste, use clean hands or a rag to carefully apply it to the grill grate. make sure to cover the entire surface, paying special attention to the dirtiest spots, and let the paste sit on the grate for at least 20 minutes.it’s best to remove the grate from the grill before you apply the paste. that will allow you to cover both sides so you don’t miss any spots. , if you haven’t cleaned your stainless steel grate in a while, it may need a more intense cleanser to freshen it. apply a generous coat of oven cleaner spray over both sides of the grate. place the grate inside a plastic garbage bag, and allow it to sit overnight.you can use the oven cleaner if the baking soda paste doesn't work. it's not necessary to do both unless your grate is extremely dirty and the baking soda leaves residue behind. any oven cleaner will work to clean the grate, but you may want to choose a cleanser that is designed for use on both ovens and grills. , after you’ve let the baking soda paste or the oven cleaner sit on the grate for the designated time, use a wire grill brush designed for stainless steel to scrub the entire surface. make sure to run the brush between and along the sides of the grate to remove all of the cooked-on residue.check your grill brush to make sure that it’s in good condition before using it. there shouldn’t be any bristles coming out. , once you’ve given the grate a good scrubbing with the brush, use your garden hose to spray it down with warm water. make sure to remove all of the cleanser and dirt residue, and then dry the grate with a clean towel. return it to the grill so you’re ready for the next barbecue.if the grill grate is particularly dirty, you may need to repeat the cleaning process more than once to fully remove all of the dirt and food residue. , when your stainless steel grill grate is clean, you’ll want to keep it that way. allow the grill to cool down for 5 to 10 minutes after using it, but while it’s still warm, use your grill brush to scrub the grate down to remove any food debris.to limit residue on the grate, always preheat your grill before placing food on it. that will help keep items from sticking to the grate. be sure to oil your food before placing it on the grate to help keep anything from sticking to the surface. , the flame tamers sit directly on top of the burners to form a barrier between the burners and", "having a positive work environment can also make a big difference in the way that you feel about your job. if you are not too close with your coworkers, then you might consider spending more time getting to know them. some things you can do to get to know your coworkers better include:attending social functions, such as meeting up with other teachers for happy hour or going to a barbeque at someone’s house. eating lunch with other teachers in the teacher’s lounge instead of alone in your classroom. asking other teachers questions about their lives, interests, and teaching. , your students will look to you each day to set the tone in the classroom. one way to help keep your students in good spirits is to set a positive tone for the class every day. some things you can try include:putting an inspirational quote on the board. telling a joke for the day. greeting each of your students with a smile when he or she enters your class in the morning. , sometimes you might feel like you are not making a difference, which may get you feeling down about teaching. to help yourself stay positive, try making a list of all of the ways that you are having an impact on your students’ lives. some things that you might list include:being a source of encouragement for a child whose parents rarely provide any encouragement. teaching vital skills to students that will help them to find jobs and succeed in life. providing a positive, safe space where students can share honestly and be themselves., all teachers have to be evaluated throughout their careers. these evaluations are meant to help you find ways to improve and be the best teacher you can be. try to stay open minded when you are criticized or advised to change something about your teaching.even if you are an experienced teacher, try to use your evaluations as opportunities to broaden your knowledge and become even more experienced. for example, if you are criticized for going too quickly when you lecture about something, then you might look into ways to pace yourself better keeping in mind that this will benefit your students. , if you are down on your job, then you might also find it helpful to seek out daily sources of inspiration. try setting aside 10 to 15 minutes every day before you start your day to get inspired.for example, you might read an inspirational quote every morning, journal about someone you admire and whose behavior you would like to model through your teaching, or just watch a video online that inspires you. , while it is fine to want to vent now and then, if you find that you are surrounded by negative discussions of teaching, then this could be wearing on you.to stay positive about your job, it is important to focus on the positives and avoid conversations that are just about criticizing your profession. if a conversation becomes negative, then try changing the subject. try saying something like, “yeah, that sucks. oh, i just", "the first sign of dupuytren's contracture is a change to the skin on your palms. it will cause lumps and pits to develop on the surface of the hand. these lumps and pits are tough areas and they usually form very gradually.this condition commonly affects both hands but may be more severe in one or the other.; , as the condition progresses it will impact your ability to straighten out your fingers. if your ring and pinkie finger are curling up and it is difficult to straighten them out completely, you may have dupuytren's contracture.you may also be able to feel thick cords developing under the skin between the palm and one or two of your fingers. these cords are what is causing the loss of finger function. , dupuytren's contracture does occur more often in men of northern european descent who are over the age of 40. additionally, it often runs in families, so if you have relatives with the condition you are more likely to get it.there are also other risk factors, such as smoking and diabetes. if you are a smoker or if you have diabetes you have a higher chance of getting this condition. knowing your risk factors for this condition can help you to assess whether it is likely that you have it. for example, if you have none of the risk factors for dupuytren's contracture then any symptoms that you have may be caused by a different condition. , before you see your doctor you should know what they will ask you, so that you can be prepared to answer. first, you should be able to tell your doctor about all of your symptoms and the risk factors you have for dupuytren's contracture. you should also try and remember when your symptoms started and if they have changed over time.when making the appointment to see your doctor tell the receptionist about your symptoms. this will allow the doctor to do a little research about conditions that might be causing your symptoms before meeting with you. , in most cases, a doctor can diagnose dupuytren's contracture just by looking at and feeling the hands. they will look at the surface of the palms and feel around deep into the palms.when inspecting the hands, the doctor will be feeling for the thick cords inside the hands that are causing the fingers to curl and tighten. , your doctor may have you do a tabletop test to assess the extent of your dupuytren's contracture. with this test you will simply place your palms against the top of a table to see how flat you can get your fingers.during the tabletop test, if the joint closest to your palm is curved more than 40 degrees or the joints further down the fingers are curved more than 20 degrees, then the condition is considered advanced. with fingers this curled, your doctor will likely suggest surgery., in cases of dupuytren's contracture that are not progressing very quickly and do not inhibit movement or function, it is likely that your doctor will suggest", "there are numerous activities at your local park that can provide sensory stimulation, education, and enrichment for your blind or visually impaired child. a play date at the park also is a great idea if your child has a friend without significant vision impairment.you might pull up plants and examine the roots with your child, or catch bugs. they also may have fun exploring playgrounds, swinging on swings or running their hands over the equipment to see how it's put together. if you live in the united states, you might try npr's directory of accessible playgrounds nationwide. just visit www.playgroundsforeveryone.com and type in an address to begin., because petting zoos focus on the senses of touch, smell, and hearing, they can be great places for a blind or visually impaired child to explore the world and connect with different kinds of animals.the animals at petting zoos typically are very calm and tame, and will allow your child to explore them. talk to your child about the animal they are touching, the part of that animal the child is touching, and what that animal does. when the child touches a different animal, talk about the differences between the two. , many libraries and museums have play-date type activities specifically designed for blind and visually impaired kids. these events can help your child explore their community as well as giving them the opportunity to meet other blind or visually impaired kids their age.your local library or community center may have a bulletin board where information about activities and events are posted. you also may be able to find this information on the library's website. if your city government has a community events page on its website, you also may be able to find information there. ask at local museums, especially children's museums, to find out if they have special events or specific days for blind or visually impaired kids. , if your child enjoys the water, backyard water slides, wading pools, or fountains can provide a fun activity for a play date, especially on hot days. you don't have to get fancy – often a simple garden hose is enough.keep in mind that if there are too many elements, they can get overwhelming. try to limit your water play activities to one or two things. if your child doesn't like cold water, you might try running the hose from the kitchen sink so you can use warm water. if you make a slide in the backyard, you can use other liquids on the surface, such as whipped cream, so the kids can enjoy different sensations. just make sure the liquid you use isn't too slick. , if you live in or near a more rural area, you may be able to find a working berry farm where you can take your blind or visually impaired child along with a friend. picking berries engages your child's senses of touch, hearing, and taste.this also can be an educational experience, because the child will learn where berries come from and how they are harvested. call ahead to", "an outline is a useful way to help you summarize information. your first step to understanding the chapter is to read the material. skimming means to read quickly and somewhat superficially.focus on key terms. many textbooks will put these significant words in bold print to help you quickly locate them. do not spend too much time trying to read each word. on your first read through, scan the information to get a sense of what the chapter is about. skim the chapter, reading the introduction and conclusion. also read the first sentence or two of each paragraph. you are trying to figure out what the main points of the chapter are.; , once you understand the basic concept of the chapter, it is time to prepare your outline. most outlines are formatted using a combination of numbers and letters. typically, the main points are denoted with roman numerals, and the sub points are marked with letters.for example, if you are writing an outline for a chapter about the american civil war, you want to start by organizing your outline with the main points. it might be something such as: i. the origins of the conflict ii. significant battles iii. impact on the north iv. impact on the south v. reconstruction. once you have your main points, you can add sub points. for i. the origins of the conflict, you could add a. slavery b. state's rights make sure that the points of the outline are based on the main points of the chapter. you could consider using the subheadings of the outline as your main points. , your outline will include additional components. after you have a format, you can work on writing the introduction. the introduction for your outline should be one paragraph long.the most important thing to include in your introduction is the thesis statement. the thesis is the argument, or main point, of the chapter. for example, the thesis in the chapter on the civil war might be, \"the civil war was a victory for the north because of more material resources, such as metals, and a larger population base.\" rewrite the thesis in your own words, and include it in your introduction. your introduction should also give a brief overview of the significant points in the chapter. the introduction should be at the beginning of the outline. once that is finished, you can fill in the numerals and numbers with your main points. , an effective outline will be succinct. you do not need to rewrite the entire chapter. however, you will want to add enough information to each of your points to give you a clear idea of what you are trying to comprehend.an annotation is a comment or explanation. include an annotation for each of your sub points. for example, you could annotate i. the origins of the conflict, a. slavery, by saying something like, \"the south was resistant to reforming society without 4 million slaves. this was also an ideological cause of the war. the annotations should provide enough information to be useful, but not", "people request business valuations for various purposes and each purpose will demand a different valuation process and result. the need to valuate a business might result from wanting to buy or sell a business, gift and estate tax purposes, stock liquidations and transfers, divorces, stock plans, going public, and obtaining financing. for example, if you are going through a divorce, the valuation process is often set out in statutes. while you may have to use these statutes for the purpose of valuing a business upon divorce, it may not take account of various factors that might be important if you wanted to buy or sell a business. in addition, one party to the divorce may want a higher valuation in order to get his or her \"fair share.\" in another example, if you are valuing a business to sell it to a family member, you might not be concerned with obtaining the greatest value possible. instead, your value will be based on complying with minimum tax requirements.; , before a business can be properly valuated, you need to know exactly what is at stake. if the entire business is being sold, the entire business will need to valued. if only a few pieces of real property are going to be sold, those pieces of real property will need to be valued. if you are going to offer stock options to certain employees, the value of the stock will need to be determined. , after determining why and what you are valuing, scan through the possible valuation methods to help you understand what type of information you will need to gather moving forward. while you do not need to choose your valuation method immediately, having an idea of what you want to do will help you prepare for the process. for example, if you are using a market-based method, you will need to gather information about comparable businesses in your area. if you are using income-based methods, you will need to look closely at your past and present financials in order to determine likely future income. if you are using an asset-based method, you will need to gather information about all of the assets and liabilities the business has on their balance sheet., if you are unsure how to navigate the business valuation process, or if you want professional help to get you the best valuation possible, you can hire valuation consultants, appraisers, business brokers, and lawyers. all of these professionals will help you gather and analyze data, make strategic decisions that can influence value, and actually valuate the business. valuation consultants will go through the entire process by your side. they will help you determine the what and why, select an appraiser, interact with the appraiser, gather documents, and analyze those documents.appraisers will actually valuate the business. business brokers will help you sell your business if that is why you want the business valued. reputable brokers will have connections in your market and can help you sell your business quickly and for a fair price.lawyers will help you comply with any legal", "it’s important to understand the two forms of fiber, and which foods contain soluble or insoluble fiber.soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like material, which can lower your cholesterol and blood glucose levels. it also slows down your digestion and is more likely to cause gas. it is found in foods like oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables. consume more water to help absorb soluble fiber. this is important when taking any fiber supplement as well. insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water. it promotes movement in your digestive tract, so it accelerates your digestion. as a result, it causes you to have less gas than soluble fiber. insoluble fiber is found in foods such as whole wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts, green beans, and potatoes.; , it’s important to balance your fiber consumption so you eat both insoluble and soluble fiber sources. this will help you stay healthy and get enough fiber in your diet.but to cut down on gas, try substituting certain soluble fiber foods with insoluble fiber foods.for example, oat bran contains mostly soluble fiber, and wheat bran contains more insoluble fiber. so, regular wheat bran cereal or bran muffins may cause less gas than oat bran cereal or oat bran muffins., beans are known to be major sources of gas, but dried beans may cause less gas, post meal. soaking the dried beans overnight before you eat them can lessen the impact of beans on your digestive system. , these foods are great sources of fiber, but they can cause gas and bloating. if possible, limit your consumption of these foods to once a month, or substitute these foods for other vegetables that are less gas-inducing.leafy green vegetables like spinach, collard greens, and lettuce are mostly packed with insoluble fiber, so they are a good source of nutrients and should cause less gas. avoid raw vegetables, as they are harder for your body to break down and can lead to gas. steam or cook vegetables before you eat them., the bacteria in your stomach and small intestine need time to catch up with your fiber consumption. adding too much fiber too quickly can cause gas, bloating, cramps, and diarrhea. increase your fiber intake about 5 grams (0.2 oz) per a day, over a period of 1-2 weeks, to allow your body time to adjust.you may experience bloating and gas at the beginning of your fiber intake. but over time, your body will adjust to the fiber and you should see a reduction in bloating and gas.remember to increase fiber with water at the same time. increase water intake anytime you add fiber to your diet to prevent constipation. , the recommended fiber intake for older children, adolescents, and adults is no more than 35 grams (1.2 oz) of fiber a day.younger children will not be able to eat enough calories to achieve this amount of fiber in their daily diet. but you should introduce whole grains, fresh fruits, and leafy greens to your child’s diet so they can build", "in order to have any chance at all of surviving to \"tell the tale,\" you must understand that your attitude is the single most important ally that you are likely to have. above all, your will to live and to \"beat the odds\" will sustain you even when your situation seems utterly hopeless. this basic principle holds true for every situation in which a person is forced to live in a dangerous or outright hostile environment. it doesn't matter if you're in a combat zone, lost in the jungle, or if you've crashed your plane into the side of a mountain or find yourself in an abusive relationship, sheer determination is what separates the survivors from the \"statistics\".; , a warm, dry place not only keeps you out of the elements and gives you a somewhat secure place in which to plan your next move, but also provides many psychological benefits. , it is imperative that you remain calm and think! if you let panic overrule common sense and critical thinking, then you set yourself up for a series of mistakes in a situation that leaves little room for error. , take stock of yourself and your surroundings. surviving for a long period of time in adverse conditions means conserving your resources and knowing where and how to gather more. resources can also include allies (anyone available to you who is trustworthy and willing to help). don't isolate yourself, accept assistance from allies if it is available. this applies especially if the \"enemy\" is a human or large animal. , in most survival scenarios the elements (i.e. heat, cold, predators, terrain, etc.), along with hunger and thirst are the antagonists. in other cases, such as combat or an abusive relationship, the \"enemy\" is an actual person or group. in all cases you must learn as much as you can about what or whom you are dealing with. , this is the tricky part because of the danger inherent in both of these courses of action. if you are relatively sure that someone at least has some idea of where you are then you might want to stay put so you will be easier to find. if you are unsure, then your best course of action might be to strike out on your own and move toward a location that will offer you the best chance of being rescued. you can literally \"what if\" yourself to death about this so trust your instincts and make a decision. right or wrong, at least you will be doing something to save your own life. , there are many ways to do this. one way is to come up with three workable plans incorporating the information and resources gathered in steps three through six and then work through a list of pros and cons for each plan. pick the most feasible of the three and file the other two away as back-up plans. however, it is vitally important that you remember to remain flexible! no matter how good your plan is, it is likely that you", "shading is what makes a drawing pop and prevents it from feeling flat. a big part of the illusion of three-dimensions in good drawings is the shading. but shading is tough to master, especially when you are trying to shade something from your imagination or memory. shading can imply lines as well. think about the two small ridges between your nose and upper lip. while you could draw lines for them, that would make them unrealistically pronounced. try shading them in instead, darkening the areas around them lightly to make them “appear” in the middle of the dark patches. , shadows are created because they are exposed to less light then other parts of the scene. where the light is coming from, what type of light it is, and even the time of day will all affect your shadows. shadows are created on opposite sides of the light. for example, if you place a ball down and shine a light on it from the right, the left side of the ball will appear darker. this is where you would shade if you were drawing the ball. , the edge of the shadow is how quickly it disappears. think of trying to make a shadow puppet—when your hand is close to the light and the wall, there is a hard edge where your shadow and the light meet; but when your hand is farther away you shadow softly fades into the light. note however, the all shadows have a slightly soft edge. the difference between shading and contour drawing is the fading at the edges.direct light, like spotlights and clear, sunny days, creates dramatic shadows with hard edges. indirect light, light far away lights, multiple lights, or cloudy days, create softer, muted shadows with faded edges. , make soft, gentle lines around the edges of your shadows before starting them so that you know where you are going to. map out the highlights: where is the light the strongest? is there any glare? sketch out the shading: where does the shadow on each object start and stop? contour any hard shadows. are there any dark shapes created by the light, like a person’s shadow in the sun? , shading is the art of gradually changing the amount of light from one area to the other. start lightly, shading in the entire object with your lightest pencil strokes. keep going over the drawing by filling in the darker areas slowly, one shade at a time. , this is the best way to make realistic, gradual shadows on any drawing. using a tissue, your finger, or light marks with your pencil, blend the darker areas into the lighter ones by rubbing from dark to light. most pencils will blend only slightly, while drawing with charcoal allows you to dramatically blend your shadows with your fingers. , set up a basic “still life” to practice shading. simply place several common, easy to draw objects (a ball, small boxes, water bottles, etc.) under a bright light and turn it on. draw the contours of the objects, then", "pull back the section of hair at the very top of your head. you can pull it straight back or leave a part if you prefer. tie it into a ponytail. because you will be working with multiple ponytails and it can get a bit confusing, this will be referred to as ponytail #1. ; , grab the entire ponytail and bring it toward your face. it will be hanging right in front of your eyes, but don’t worry – it’s only temporary! clip your ponytail here so that you can work with the rest of your hair without it getting in the way. , grab hair on either side of the first section. bring it towards the back, securing it with a hair elastic into ponytail #2. it should be directly below the base of ponytail #1., split the ponytail right down the middle so that you have a left and right section. pull ponytail #2 straight through the two sections of ponytail #1 so that it’s going toward your face. just like you did with ponytail #1, secure ponytail #2 toward your face with a hair clip so that it is out of the way., section more hair from the sides, bringing it to the back of your head. this time, include all of the hair from ponytail #1 as well. use a hair tie to create ponytail #3, right below the base of ponytail #2. , just like you did before, divide this ponytail into two equal sections of hair. take ponytail #3 up through those two sections and clip it forwards again. now, you will probably start seeing the pattern you use to create this “braid.” , again, gather your hair from the sides of your head and pull it to the back. include the hair of ponytail #2. secure this ponytail with another clear elastic. once that ponytail is secured, unclip ponytail #3 from the top of your head. split ponytail #3 into two sections, bring ponytail #4 up through the middle, and clip it to the top of your head. , once you’ve reached your neck, secure all of the hair (except the clipped up section) into a low ponytail. let down the clipped section so that you’re left with two ponytails, which will be used to create the tail part of your braid., after you’ve “braided” to the nape of your neck and secured your hair into low ponytails, you want to go back and create the volume that makes this braid so big. gently pull on the loops of hair you created when you split each ponytail into two sections. you want to loosen them carefully so they aren’t pulled tightly against your head. , after you’ve pulled on the loops in order to loosen up the strands of hair, gently pull them outwards to add volume. in other words, the loops should be loosened up so that you can pull them wide. the larger your loops become, the thicker and more voluminous your hair will look in this braid. , this step is", "to make a versatile disinfectant with vinegar, simply mix equal parts white vinegar and water and store the mixture in a spray bottle. you can use this mixture to clean:telephones, doorknobs, and other surfaces: spray on and wipe off mirrors and glass: spray on and wipe dry with a rubber squeegee blade freezer and refrigerator: soak a cloth with the solution and wipe the surface to clean and remove odors microwave: fill a small bowl with the solution and microwave on high for two minutes, then wipe down the inside of the microwave; , this all-purpose cleaner recipe is more diluted than the disinfectant, but it’s still great for many cleaning jobs around the house. just spray the cleaner on and wipe down things like counters, walls, toys, tables, blinds, and other surfaces. to make the cleaner, combine:3 cups (705 ml) of water 1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lemon juice 10 drops lemon essential oil , a basic floor cleaner is more diluted than all-purpose cleaners and disinfectants. make this cleaner as necessary when it’s time to clean the floors. this solution can also be used on counters, tiles, and for other minor cleaning needs around the house. in a large bucket, combine ½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar and ½ gallon (1.9 l) of warm water.soak a mop or sponge in the solution, wring out the excess, and wipe the floor. allow the floor to air dry. , mattresses are difficult to clean because they can’t go in the washing machine, can't be taken to the dry cleaner, and are too large and unwieldy to wash in the normal ways. but you can make an odor-killing disinfectant with vinegar: in a spray bottle, combine 1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar, ¼ cup (59 ml) of rubbing alcohol, and 10 drops of tea tree oil.remove the sheets from the mattress and spray the solution over the entire mattress. let the mattress air dry throughout the day. , polishing tarnished metals with cleaner is a smelly job that requires care because commercial metal cleaners are strong chemical solutions. you can make your own polish for copper, pewter, and brass instead. to make and use this paste:combine 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, ½ cup (118 ml) of vinegar, and enough flour to make a paste apply the paste to the tarnished metal with an old toothbrush or jewelry brush leave the paste on the metal for about 15 minutes rinse under warm water buff the metal with a dry microfiber cloth , a vinegar-based stain remover can be used to remove stains and tough dirt from carpets, clothes, upholstery, drapes, and even dishware. simply spray the cleaner on the affected surface, let it soak for two minutes, and then blot the area with a cloth. to make a stain remover for fabrics, combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid laundry soap, and 1 cup (235 ml) of warm water in a spray bottle.to make a stain remover for hard surfaces, combine", "before you begin studying, it is important to identify what your goals are. set a target grade for each exam and think about what you will need to do to achieve that grade. be realistic; consider how well you've been doing all year, how good your understanding of the material is and window of time you have to study. don't set your goals too low either. try to push yourself and set your mind to achieving your full potential.; , making an effective and realistic study plan is a vital component of doing well in your finals. by planning out your study, you can ensure that you will have all the necessary materials covered by the time the exams roll around, thus minimizing stress and maximizing productivity. here are some things you will need to consider: create a time chart of your current activities. factor in classes, work, time spent with family and friends, etc. this will allow you to see how much free time you have available for study. develop a study schedule that works with your timetable. use time between classes, commute time and any other free time to slot in some extra study. keep in mind that an hour of study every day will be more productive than a 5-hour block once a week. determine your study goals. you shouldn't just write vague guidelines like \"study biology\" -- your study plan needs to be specific. break down your study material into specific topics and tasks and fill these into your study schedule. give 20-minute slots to small, bite-size chunks of information and commit to the idea that you will know that information inside out by the end of those 20 minutes. stick to your schedule. a study schedule is no good if you don't stick to it. that's why it needs to be realistic. factor in breaks and potential distraction when planning, so there will be no excuses when the time comes. if it helps, think of the study schedule like a job. you have no option but to do it. consider that studying for a certain subject might take longer than you thought, so put in some extra time into your schedule. , this may seem like a bit of a no-brainer, but the earlier you start studying, the more prepared you'll be come exam time. starting early ensures that you will have time to cover all the necessary material, time to do practice exams and maybe even time to do some extra reading, which will give you an edge on the day. by beginning to study well in advance, you will also feel less stressed out and anxious and have more confidence in yourself. ideally, you should make studying part of your weekly routine throughout the school year, not just coming up to exams. you should prepare for classes by doing the required readings, along with some extra reading around the topic under discussion. engage with your professors, ask questions about anything you don't understand and take extensive notes, as these will be an invaluable study tool", "\"one way to diminish the chances of pregnancy without using a condom is to try the withdrawal method. this method consists of the man removing his penis just prior to ejaculation, so that the sperm do not have a chance to travel up the woman's vagina in a way that may lead to pregnancy. the challenge with this method is that some sperm may leak out prematurely (prior to ejaculation and thus prior to withdrawal of the man's penis), which is what makes this method only 78% effective at preventing pregnancy. ,\"technically, there are only a few days each month when a woman can actually become pregnant. most women have a 28 day cycle, which starts on the first day of her period. on average, ovulation occurs on day 14, but a woman can be fertile for several days before and after ovulating. if a woman has sex significantly before or after her most fertile days, her chances of becoming pregnant are much lower. the downside to the calendar method is that not all women have exactly 28 day cycles. there is quite a bit of variability between women, and one woman may even find that her own menstrual cycles are not completely consistent from month to month. it is for this reason that this method is only 76% effective at preventing pregnancy, without the use of a condom. if your cycle is consistently more or less than 28 days, subtract 14 days from the end of your cycle and consider this the start of your most fertile few days. the second half of a woman's menstrual cycle (following ovulation) tends to be much more consistent than the first half of the cycle (prior to ovulation). , you can then avoid having sex on those days when the woman's fertility is high. with the \"basal body temperature\" method, a woman measures her temperature first thing in the morning and before eating every day. it will rise 0.4-1.0 degrees fahrenheit following ovulation. therefore, it is advisable to use a condom, a spermicide, or another non-hormonal form of birth control from the first day following the woman's period to three days after her basal body temperature has risen. with the \"cervical mucus\" method, the woman observes the characteristics of her cervical mucus discharge. there is typically no mucus discharge immediately following a period, mild and sticky secretions in the days after that, greatly increased mucus secretions that are more wet and clear in the days surrounding ovulation, and no noticeable secretions following the end of her \"fertile period\" all the way until the beginning of the woman's next menstrual cycle. therefore, during days when cervical mucus is abundant, clear and wet, it is important to avoid sexual intercourse as this is when a woman's fertility is at its peak., both the withdrawal method as well as the calendar method are significantly less effective than the medical methods of contraception. it is important not to rely on these techniques if you are truly seeking to avoid a pregnancy. here's why: if you are a man", "sometimes livestock wander onto a road and collide with traveling vehicles. these kinds of accidents can cause serious damage. if your livestock injures someone in this manner, then you can expect to be sued. accordingly, you should meet with a lawyer as soon as possible. don’t wait until the lawsuit is filed. you can get a referral to an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.once you have a referral, you can schedule a consultation. many lawyers now offer free or reduced-fee consultations. take relevant documents, such as police reports and photographs, to the attorney. , you should also think about hiring the lawyer to represent you. if costs are a concern, then discuss different billing arrangements with the lawyer. for example, she might be willing to represent you for a flat fee instead of the usual billable hour. also, the lawyer might be willing to do only the work that you give her. this is called “limited scope representation.” for example, you might handle all of the pre-trial work yourself but hire a lawyer to represent you at trial. ask the lawyer during your consultation if he or she offers this service. , if you run a farm, then you should be carrying insurance to cover accidents caused by your livestock. take out your policy and find the contact number. you shouldn’t delay contacting your insurer. your policy usually contains a deadline for reporting claims. you should report them as soon as possible. , once a lawsuit is filed, the plaintiff will send you a copy of the complaint and the summons. go through each document carefully to see what facts the plaintiff alleges in support of the lawsuit. you will probably be sued for “negligence.”negligence means that you were not reasonably careful in how you penned up the animal. this is a fact-specific inquiry. the jury will need to look at how you restrained your livestock—with a fence, by keeping them in a locked barn, etc.—and whether these actions were reasonable. , you can defend against a negligence claim by arguing that you were sufficiently reasonable in the care you took to restrain the animal. for example: the fences you installed were in good working condition and were sufficiently high to keep the animal from escaping. the day of the accident, the fence might have failed because of damage caused by a storm. you weren’t responsible for the animal escaping. instead, someone else (like a vandal), broke the fence or otherwise released the animal.the injured person helped cause the injury. for example, if someone sneaks onto your property and frees an animal, then he is responsible if the animal then stomps on him. , you will need to draft an answer and file it with the court before the deadline stated in the summons. you should get an answer form from the court where the lawsuit has been filed. , if you have an attorney, then the attorney can represent you. a trial typically consists of jury selection, the presentation of witnesses and evidence, and opening and closing", "go to the home screen on your phone or tablet and look for the icon of your device’s photo app. on iphones, this app will simply be called “photos,” though on other operating systems it might be labelled “pictures” or “gallery.” tap the icon once to launch the app.on iphones, the “photos” app is normally on the first page of the home screen. for non-iphone users, your photo manager app may appear among your other app icons or in a scrolling bar at the bottom of the screen. inside your photo app, you’ll find all of the photos you’ve taken or saved, along with the various subfolders they’ve been grouped into—selfies, panoramas, instagram photos, etc.; , sort through your stored photos to find the ones you want to remove from your device. you can either browse your entire gallery (known as the “camera roll” on iphones) to see them all laid out in one place or explore different subfolders if you have them separated. tap a photo to select and enlarge it.selecting a photo will also allow you to find out more about it, such as the file size and type and the date it was taken or saved. , once the photo is displayed on the screen, look for the delete option in the upper or lower righthand corner. on most devices, this appears as an icon in the form of a trash can. tap this icon to select the photo for deletion.most devices will ask you to confirm whether or not you want to delete the photo. simply choose “delete” to move forward with the process, or “cancel” if you’ve changed your mind. choosing to delete a photo doesn’t actually remove it from your phone. instead, it sends it to a “recently deleted” folder, where it can be either be recovered or permanently erased. , if you’re trying to delete several pictures at once, you can save time by batching them together. pull up your photo manager app so that you’re looking at an overview of all your pictures. hit the trash icon or “select” option on your screen, then tap each photo you want to remove individually. after you’ve finished selecting the photos, your phone will erase all of them at the same time.this function is useful if you want to hand pick which photos stay or go, or you’re trying to destroy all evidence of a bad selfie session. be careful not to accidentally select a photo you want to keep. , deleting a picture only removes it from your photo gallery. to erase it from your device once and for all, go back to the main screen of your photo app and look for the “recently deleted” folder. all the photos you’ve deleted will remain here for a certain amount of time before they’re erased automatically. to speed up this process, tap the “select” option and either choose which photos you want to delete permanently or hit “delete all” to clear the photos out of your storage.it’s impossible to recover a photo after it’s been erased from", "writing a good philosophy paper takes time and careful planning, so make sure that you begin working on the assignment as soon as possible. philosophy papers require skillful argument and rational thought, which takes time to develop.try to begin developing your ideas for your philosophy paper as soon as you get the assignment. jot down your ideas and use some of your spare time to think about what you want to write about.; , before you begin to develop your ideas for the paper, make sure that you have carefully read all of the materials that are related to the assignment. if you read the materials, but do not remember much or do not understand part of what you read, then you should reread the texts before you attempt to work on your paper.having a solid understanding of the concepts covered in your readings is essential to create an effective paper. otherwise, your explanation of the philosophy may be flawed or your argument may not hold up. , some professors distribute assignment guidelines while others simply describe the assignment in class. before you start working on your paper, make sure that you have a clear understanding of what your professor is asking you to do.if any part of the assignment is unclear, ask your professor for clarification. , it is important to keep your audience in mind as you plan your paper and as you write your paper. your professor is your primary audience member and your classmates might also be part of your audience.you can also think of your audience as a person who has some knowledge of philosophy, but who does not have the same understanding as you do. therefore, if you introduce a special term or concept, you will need to define it for your audience. , with philosophy papers, it is best to use quotes from the text only when it is absolutely necessary. the goal of your paper is to explain and evaluate a philosophical argument in your own words. therefore, you should not rely too heavily on quotes or even paraphrased passages from your sources.only use a quote when it is necessary to support your point of view. make sure to provide a citation for every quote or paraphrase that you use from a source. include the author’s name as well as a page number. , all philosophy papers need to have a strong thesis. your thesis states your position for the paper and you will need to make sure that you stay focused on your thesis and support it throughout your entire paper. keep in mind that a strong thesis states your position as well as why you hold that position.for example, if you plan to refute aristotle’s idea that beauty is related to virtue, then you would have to provide a brief explanation of why. one reason that you may cite might be that beautiful people are not always virtuous. in this case, your thesis might be something like, “aristotle’s concept that beauty is related to virtue is false because beauty is often found", "when a police officer comes to your door, they are usually required to knock and announce their presence.in addition to knocking, police are supposed to state their purpose for being there and announce that they are officers of the law.impersonators may or may not know about these rules, and therefore an impersonator may not knock and announce themselves as an officer. if someone in a police uniform knocks on your door and does not state their purpose for being there, do not open the door. , even if someone in uniform knocks and announces their presence, do not immediately open the door. ask the person outside to describe the purpose of their visit, and start a dialogue without opening the door. if it is a real officer, they should have no problem explaining their visit and having a conversation through the door until you can verify their identity. if the person at your door is an impersonator, once you open the door, the barrier between yourself and the impersonator will be gone. once this happens, the impersonator can get inside where they may want to commit a crime. , while talking to the person through the door, examine the uniform they are wearing.the clothes themselves should be clean and unwrinkled. uniforms with stains and uniforms that do not fit properly are good indications of a fake. also, look for a hat, which is a requirement for police officers. the uniform will always include a badge, name tag, and service tags.the badge will be made out of metal and will never be plastic or flimsy. service tags indicate the years of service an officer has had on the force.look for a utility belt with all of the tools of the trade.these tools include a flashlight, firearm, handcuffs, taser, bullet magazines, and pepper spray.the utility belt itself is usually made of woven leather.all officers will carry a radio, so be sure the person you see has one.try to identify the officer's citation pad., once you have examined what the person is wearing, or while you are doing so, ask to see the officer's identification. a trained officer should comply with this request promptly and professionally.the officer should have a badge, identification card, and even a photo id.while an impersonator may be able to fake a badge, it is much more difficult to fake a photo id and police identification card. if the person cannot show you these things, they may be impersonating an officer. , if you have any doubt after examining and speaking with the officer, call the police.dispatchers will know whether an officer has been sent to your home and if they are currently there.the dispatcher will send out a real officer if there is any doubt as to what is unfolding. real officers should never be upset if you choose to call the police to verify their identity. this verification process is easy and pain free for the officer, so they should be happy to let you make the phone call. if anyone asks that you not call the police, they", "saving money is one of the most important skills on the path to wealth. while the saying \"a penny saved is a penny earned\" is true to an extent, in reality, a penny saved may equal a dollar earned over time if you properly invest your saved money. saving money requires one thing — to spend less than you take in. this is easier to do if you have a solid income (which is why investing in education is important), but it is important to remember that it is possible to save money regardless of your income, even if the amounts are small. try to start by saving 10% of your paycheck each month. while this is a recommended goal, if this is not possible, simply save what you can, with the goal being to add something to your savings each month.; , a solid budget is the first step on the path to wealth. it helps you to identify all your expenses, and therefore control and reduce them. this, in turn, allows you to save your money which gives you capital to invest with. on a sheet of paper or in a word processing document, list all your income for the course of a month in one column. at the bottom, add up the sources to determine a total. in another column, do the same for expenses. make sure to include everything. one helpful way to do this is to examine your bank statement and credit card statement. add all the expenses in the column together to determine the total monthly expenses. , look closely at the expense column to find areas to reduce spending. your goal should be to create more \"space\" between the total number in the income column, and the total number in the expense column. one way to do this is to examine the difference between \"wants\", and \"needs\". a need is essential, whereas as a want is option. look to your \"wants\" each month to find reductions. for example, you may want a brand new phone with a 3gb data plan, while you only need a basic phone with a simple 1gb plan. consider looking at your needs as well, and examining how to reduce them. for example, rent is a need, but you may be able to find a more affordable apartment in a cheaper area of town, or downgrade from a two-bedroom to a one-bedroom, for example. , before you invest at all, always have an emergency savings fund prepared. experts recommend having at least three months of living expenses set aside in case of a job loss, medical emergency, or unexpected expense. after an emergency fund is prepared, you can then focus on using your savings to build your investment portfolio. , about half of american workplaces have access to something called a 401(k), which is a special plan whereby some money is deducted every month from your check and invested. often, your employer will match all or a portion of your contribution. the benefit of a 401(k) is that your money can", "a launch driver is responsible for the operation of a launch boat, usually a 24–30 foot (7.3–9.1 m) open-top, diesel-powered vessel. the launch driver handles the operation and maintenance of the vessel, in addition to providing passengers with friendly service and useful information. duties include: starting up the boat at the beginning of the day, making sure to check routine fluids including: the level and condition of the engine oil (should be at the proper level as indicated on the dipstick and not too dirty). the level of the coolant (should be visible when the cap is removed) (warning: never check coolant after running the engine, because hot coolant could spray out under pressure, causing injury). the condition of the transmission fluid (should be dark red and translucent – if it is white and milky, salt has penetrated the transmission housing and must be flushed out before the transmission is engaged). the amount of fuel in the tank – you don’t want to run out while untied in open water! tying the launch boat off while picking passengers up at the dock/pier. greeting the passengers warmly as they enter the boat and providing up-to-date weather information and harbor information. assisting passengers with stowing additional gear aboard the boat if they require help. navigating the waterways safely and in accordance with local navigational rules. planning and executing an efficient drop-off and pickup route around the harbor. approaching and landing safely on customers’ boats. helping boaters who need battery jump starts, boat tows, and mooring assistance.; , in many ways, working as launch driver is a great occupation. passing workdays under the sun and on the open water is relaxing and fun. often, launch drivers receive benefits such as free boat services at the boat yard or yacht club they work for, discounts on marine products, and flexible schedules. some launch drivers are fortunate enough to work where tipping is the norm and may make a handsome amount of money in cash. , on the other hand, the job can include long hours, physically demanding days, and periods of high stress. working outdoors may sound nice at first, but after twelve hours it can be quite taxing. additionally, it is often the sole responsibility of the driver(s) on duty to remember on the go which customers have radioed requesting pickups, while simultaneously completing pickups already on their route. this can lead to stress, as sometimes a pickup can slip your mind and anger a waiting customer. , being a launch driver requires one to have organizational, logistical, and interpersonal skills. you must be independent. being a launch driver requires the confidence to take responsibility for the safety of passengers and respond to variable situations at a moment’s notice. you must be friendly. although your main duty is to pilot the boat, it is important to remember to interact with the passengers and make them feel at ease. you must be responsible. navigating varying weather, changing tides, and moving boats requires a risk-averse and conservative attitude. , be at least seventeen years of age (eighteen", "dog's with bloat deteriorate alarmingly quickly. a dog that develops bloat at bedtime, if left untreated, will most likely pass away by the morning. sometimes the deterioration is even more rapid, and the dog may pass away in less than 2 hours after first developing symptoms. because of this, it is absolutely imperative that you call your vet immediately, as soon as you notice the following symptoms.the key symptoms are a distended abdomen and non-productive retching (vomiting without producing any vomit). these signs alone should trigger an emergency phone call to the vet. however, other signs can also occur, as discussed in the following steps.; , the abdomen (or belly) is the area behind the rib cage that extends back towards the pelvis. the stomach sits within the dome of the diaphragm, but if filled with air, it extends backwards into the belly. a gas filled stomach gives the physical appearance of a swollen belly.in some large breeds (st bernards, great danes) the swollen stomach can be difficult to spot because of room for expansion within the dome of the ribs, therefore, an absence of swelling does not rule out gastric dilation. however, a swollen tummy is a significant sign. if in doubt as to whether the tummy is a normal size or not, take a photo of the dog from a sideways angle. take another photo at 10 minute intervals for comparison. if subsequent photos show the body walls bowing outwards more than previously, this is significant and you should immediately contact the vet , the swollen stomach is often full of gas or foam. when you place a hand on either side of the swelling and press gently, the area feels hard and not compressible.if you gently flick at the swollen area with a finger (like flicking a drum skin) you may get the impression of a drum like noise due to the trapped air inside the stretched stomach. , when the stomach flips over it is effectively sealed off. gastric contents cannot escape; this also means that saliva, food, and water cannot get into the stomach. thus your dog may drool saliva because he cannot swallow it down. , the distension triggers receptors in the stomach wall that tells your dog to vomit in order to empty his stomach. however, the twisted stomach is sealed off and although the dog retches or attempts to vomit, he brings nothing up other than drooled saliva. this is a serious sign and if present, contact the vet immediately. , as the stomach swells it presses forward on the diaphragm and displaces other abdominal organs backwards. this causes abdominal discomfort which may cause the dog to stand in a hunched position with his back arched. this is a general sign of abdominal discomfort, rather than specific to gdv, but if seen in conjunction with other symptoms, it should raise concern. , a dog with a dilated stomach feels uncomfortable and nauseous. this makes it difficult for him to get comfortable and he will pace and be restless. some dogs repeatedly turn and look", "even though it’s tempting to slack on oral hygiene when you have loose baby teeth, it’s important to take care of both your old and new teeth. continue a normal brushing and flossing routine, and use mouthwash to rinse away any food particles that might get caught underneath your loose tooth. otherwise, you run the risk of letting bacteria grow between your teeth and in any gaps under the loose tooth. this could lead to painful infections, or cause your adult tooth to decay as it grows under your loose baby tooth.it’s good to be extra gentle about brushing around the loose tooth or teeth, especially if your gums are sore. if you have a really loose tooth, then you can even harm the inner ligaments of your tooth if you use too much pressure. you don’t need to be too careful with baby teeth, however. they’re meant to fall out when the time is right, so you don’t have to baby them too much. if you are concerned, then you can always check on the age ranges for when a baby tooth is supposed to fall out, such as by asking your dentist or searching the internet.; , you should encourage the tooth to come out on its own by wiggling it and going about your normal routines. however, you don’t want to force it out, so don’t yank it out or chomp right down on really hard food. your baby tooth will come out when it’s ready once the root holding it in has completely dissolved leaving room for the permanent tooth to come out.removing a baby tooth before it’s ready can lead to infection, pain, and bleeding. it can also lead to eruption disorders of the permanent teeth. there could still be some root left and bacteria will grow in it. , losing baby teeth is usually painless, but sometimes they can have sharp edges that dig into gums as they wiggle. adult teeth can also cause sore gums as they erupt. if you’re experiencing sore gums or any discomfort as your baby teeth fall out and your adult teeth grow in, ask a parent for kid-friendly pain medication.ibuprofen or a gel that gently numbs your gums can help with teething pain, but if it gets worse you should go to a pediatric dentist. , chewing food when baby teeth are loose and with adult teeth growing in can be uncomfortable or painful. even if you have a sore mouth, it’s important to keep up a good, well-balanced diet. try eating vegetable soups, pureed fruits, and drink plenty of milk so your body stays strong while your teeth grow.get more calcium in your diet, such as by drinking milk and eating yogurt and cheese. however, don’t worry about supplementing with fluoride as long as you use a fluoride toothpaste two times a day. this will prevent any enamel defects such as hypomineralization or fluorosis. , sometimes, adult teeth grow in behind baby teeth before they fall out, making a double row of teeth. this isn’t a major cause for", "the type of bird feeder you choose will depend on the location you plan to hang the feeder. there are three basic types of birdfeeders: ground, hanging, and window. to look at each type and make an informed decision, visit a local pet-supply store or birdwatching store, and speak with the sales staff.ground feeders are planted in the ground and allow squirrels and chipmunks to access the food, in addition to birds. hanging feeders can be suspended from overhanging tree branches. window feeders attach to the wall of your house, outside of a window. this is probably the most practical type of feeder to use when hanging a feeder for your cats to watch.; , when deciding where to hang the feeder, choose a location near a window that birds can access easily. find a window that’s at least 10 feet (3 meters) off of the ground on the outside of the house, as this height will keep the feeder safe from squirrels, foxes, or outdoor cats.to make sure that your cats will be able to see and observe the bird feeder, it’s important that, inside the house, the window is accessible to your cats. you should also make sure that this area is easy for you to access, because you will need to tend to the feeder regularly in order to refill and clean it. , once you’ve decided on a window to hang the birdfeeder in front of, make sure that the external window screen is secure and that the window itself closes tightly. by doing this, you’ll ensure that your cats won’t be able to press on the window and open it. securing the screen will also ensure that birds won’t scratch or peck at it.additionally, if you have children in the house, it would be wise to ask them not to open the window near the feeder. this will prevent birds from flying from the feeder directly into your house. , when hanging an outdoor feeder, it’s a common problem for birds to fly into the window, mistaking the clear glass for open sky. to avoid this problem and spare birds’ lives, tape a bird-shaped silhouette on the window. this will deter birds from flying into the glass. alternatively, you can hang a reflector to the outside surface of the glass; birds will see this and avoid flying into the window.visit your local pet-supply shop, or a store dedicated to selling birdwatching products. ask the sales staff what they recommend you put in your windows to prevent birds from flying into them. , although ground feeders come in a variety of models, most of them are attached to the top of a sturdy metal pole, which simply needs to be stabbed into the soil. other models are made of wood or plastic and have a flat base or four legs, and can be placed on the ground. set up your ground feeder on a flat patch of land near a window from which your cats can look out. be aware that, when feeding birds with a ground feeder,", "remember, menstruation happens to all girls; in fact, it even happens to some female animals. the important thing to remember is that the apprehension you are feeling will lessen over time.know that your dad is mature enough to handle \"the period talk.\" as an adult male, your dad not only knows what a period is, but has probably been expecting to have this talk with you for some time. your dad may be slightly embarrassed as well. take comfort in knowing that you're not the only one trying to get a handle on your emotions. understand that your reaction is a normal one. starting your period can be both confusing and emotional. , sometimes the easiest way to approach the situation is to just say, \"dad, i got my period.\" keeping it brief and to the point will help you to avoid becoming emotional. instead of building up to a big sit down conversation, try approaching the subject during down time such as when watching television or eating dinner. by being direct, you avoid confusion and open the lines of communication between you and your dad. your openness may ease his discomfort and he may become a valuable resource for information., sometimes it's easier to write words than to speak them. but what happens if you can't find the right words to say or write? there are scripted notes online that can be addressed to anyone and that allow you to ease into the topic. with titles like \"guess what\" or \"we need to talk\" it sends a clear message to dad without the awkward talk.the great thing about this option is that it informs your parent, but puts the responsibility of initiating the conversation on them.be sure to put the note in a place where your dad is sure to find it, and make sure he'll find it at an appropriate time. giving the note to him when he's running out of the house for work isn't the best option. , sometimes it's just easier to talk to a female about female problems. if you don't have a mother or older sister around, tell your dad that you need to speak to a female about \"female issues\" you are experiencing. your dad may become curious or worried at this point. you can ease his curiosity by simply stating \"i started my period and i would rather talk to a woman about it.\" you can make your dad feel like part of the process by asking for his advice about who to go to for help., as someone who is in charge of your healthcare, your dad will probably ask why you need to visit the doctor. at this point you can inform him that you are having a personal issue. this will either open the door to further communication or give your dad a clue that something is going on. your doctor is not only a great source of information, but they can also assist you in telling your dad about your period.a close alternative is the school nurse. you can", "as soon as you know that your livestock have been injured, you should begin gathering evidence. you should take color photographs or video of your livestock. make sure that your photographs or video show the full extent of the injury. also note any damage to your property. someone might have released your livestock by damaging your fence. you want to document that as well.; , if you saw your livestock getting injured, you should write down your memories as soon as possible. by writing your memories down, you can remember them better. also, you can refer to your notes at a later date to remind you of what happened. be sure to include all relevant details. if you saw a person harming your livestock, describe their appearance: height, weight, what the person was wearing, etc. if a dog attacked your livestock, write down a description of the dog: breed, size, color, and any distinguishing characteristics. , you should call a vet to come out to your place and check your livestock. the vet can treat your livestock and save their lives. even more, the vet’s records will come in handy when you file a lawsuit, since the records are proof of the injury. hold onto the vet’s bills. you can be compensated for any veterinarian treatments needed to treat the injury., in many states, injuring livestock intentionally is a crime.because it is a crime, if your livestock have been injured, you need to contact the police. if the police find the individual responsible and prosecutors press charges, they may be found guilty and sentenced to jail time. in addition, they may have to pay fines. if the person responsible is found guilty of a crime, it will also help your civil case. therefore, it is important to contact the police and pursue criminal charges when possible. , you might not immediately know who is responsible for your livestock’s injury. however, in order to bring a lawsuit, you need to identify someone as the defendant. accordingly, you should ask neighbors if they saw anyone around the livestock and ask if they know the person’s identity. you also might want to call the police to investigate. the defendant might have harmed your livestock directly. for example, if someone shot your horse, then he is responsible for the injury. typically, you will rely on eyewitness testimony that someone directly harmed your livestock. the defendant might also have hurt your livestock indirectly. for example, if someone broke into your barn and left the door open, then he could be legally responsible if your animals escape and are injured. to help prove this kind of indirect injury, you should take photographs of your barn and the broken door. also gather evidence of how close the road is to your barn. if the barn is close to the road, then a reasonable person should know that livestock would wander out to the highway if the barn door was left open. a defendant’s dog might also have hurt your livestock.the owner is responsible for an injury caused by his", "you should carefully look over your statement every month to catch any instances of fraud or unauthorized charges. you may also be able to check your statement online, which can help you stay on top of your account on a daily or weekly basis. if you have a debit card, you should also check your online checking account balance on a regular basis.save your receipts. you'll need your receipt in case you need to return an item, and having a receipt may help you cross-check how an item was rung up at the register.; , whether you were over-charged for an item, rung up more than once for the same item, or believe you've been the victim of credit card fraud, contacting the merchant may be a useful first step. some merchants are willing to work with customers to resolve credit card disputes in-store.in cases where a customer disputes the quality or condition of goods/services, the customer may even be required to make an effort to resolve the issue with the merchant before initiating a charge dispute with the credit card company, which emphasizes the importance of alerting the merchant as soon as possible.be polite and courteous. remember that it may not be the merchant's fault, especially in the case of fraud. be polite and respectful, and you're likely to get a better reaction than customers who are angry and demanding.even if you try to resolve the issue with the merchant, you should also let your credit card issuer know about the discrepancy. this is because in the case of fraud, the abuse may have originated within the store where the unauthorized charge took place., if a charge discrepancy arises, you have certain rights under the fair credit billing act (fcba). however, some merchants may try to limit those rights. some online retailers, for example, have sales policies that restrict a customer's right to dispute charges, and threaten to add list disputing customers on a chargeback abuser database. this violates both the fcba and the user policies that most major credit card companies have in place.consumers have the right to dispute any billing errors, erroneous charges, or fraudulent charges. under the fcba, credit card companies may not harm a consumer's credit or threaten to do so for refusing to pay disputed charges while the charges in question are being investigated. credit card companies can not demand payment of disputed charges while those charges are being investigated. credit card companies are also forbidden from filing a collection lawsuit against the consumer while a charge is being disputed. consumers have a right to withhold payment for incomplete or unsatisfactory services until the claim is investigated and a decision is reached by the credit card company. a consumer wishing to stop payment must inform the credit card company of his desire to do so, and must be willing to make the payment if the investigation determines that the consumer was still responsible for making that payment. it is expected that the consumer will attempt to resolve the dispute with the party or parties who performed", "in some cases, using the wrong drugstore products can worsen acne; therefore, it might be wise to visit a dermatologist who can help you understand what is causing your acne. he can also recommend products and treatments that you can try to help clear up your skin., there are many, many products on the market (face washes, creams, pads, etc.) meant to help fight against acne, and it can be really hard to know which one will work best for you. these usually contain an active ingredient to help fight your acne. if you purchase a cleanser or other product that contains salicylic acid, but it doesn’t seem to be working after a few months of use, then try switching to another acne fighting ingredient. benzoyl peroxide is an ingredient that helps kill bacteria and keep pores clean; however, it is recommended that you not use a cleanser that has more than 2.5%. when washing your face, let it sit on the skin for about 15 seconds before rinsing. this way, it will have enough time to penetrate your pores.you can also use pads or leave-on creams with 2.5% to 10% benzoyl peroxide. salicylic acid is another common acne fighting ingredient. it works by helping get rid of dead skin cells on the skin, which often trap bacteria, causing breakouts. salicylic acid is available in cleansers and other leave-on products. products containing retinoids can help fight acne, especially blackheads and whiteheads. most retinoids are available by prescription, but you can get some (such as adapalene gel) over-the-counter. apply retinoids at night as they can make your skin sensitive to the sun, and be aware you may experience dryness and slight irritation at first. tea tree oil is a natural product which can also work great for getting rid of pimples; however, be aware that it may not work as quickly as some other products, but is great if you prefer to stick with natural ingredients. you can buy this either as an oil, which you can dab on a pimple, or there are also washes that include tea tree oil you can use as a cleanser., a multi-step will typically include a cleanser meant to wash away dirt and all of the pore-clogging things your face encounters throughout the day, a toner to swipe away any leftover dirt and/or dead skin cells, a spot treatment for the pimples you have, and, in many cases, a moisturizer.these multi-step systems are often sold together in one box, and may be the best option for mild to moderate acne sufferers because not only do they cleanse the skin, they help clear up the conditions that cause acne in the first place. , although it is very tempting when you have a big, pus-filled pimple on your face, do whatever you can to keep yourself from popping it. popping pimples can lead to even more pimples, redness, inflammation, and even scarring that you might have to deal with for the rest of your life.if you are very focused on a pimple, try dabbing some tea tree", "you can get key fragments by hunting guild eidolon spawn during certain times. every day, the guild summons different kinds of eidolons that players can kill. all who inflict

covered by the fmla, your employees become eligible for benefits once they have worked at least 1,250 hours over a 12-month period of time. reasons for fmla leave include the birth of a child, a serious medical condition that renders the employee unable to work, or the need to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition. you can use the dol's fmla fact sheet to satisfy this requirement. this fact sheet is available for download at http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.htm. the dol also has an employee guide that explains the fmla and answers some frequently asked questions about eligibility, rights, and benefits. you can download the guide at http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/employeeguide.pdf. either you or the employee may choose to substitute accrued paid leave in place of fmla leave. if you require such a substitution to be made, this requirement should be included in your employee handbook.; , because employees aren't required to indicate they are requesting leave under fmla, your supervisory employees need to know what the fmla covers and how to recognize those requests.go over forms and required notices in detail so managers and supervisors know how to provide notice as required by fmla, and the deadlines for providing that notice. your managers and supervisors should know how to calculate the 12-month leave year for fmla purposes. as an employer you can choose one of four methods, but you must apply the method you choose consistently – you can't choose one method for some employees and a different one for others.generally, you may measure the 12-month period by using the calendar year, a fixed 12-month \"leave year\" period, a 12-month period measured from the date of an employee's first fmla leave period begins, or a period measured from the first date an employees uses any fmla leave. , the dol has posters providing basic information about employee rights under the fmla that must be displayed in all covered workplaces.the poster explains the provisions of the fmla and tells employees how to file a complaint with the dol if their employer violates the act. you must display the poster in a place where employees and applicants can easily see and read it, and it must remain up even if you don't currently have any employees who are eligible for fmla leave. you can download and print a copy of the poster at http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/fmla.htm. if you have employees who are not literate in english, you must provide the poster in the language in which they are literate. , under the fmla, your payroll records must meet the same standards set in the fair labor standards act (flsa).payroll records must include identifying information, rate of pay, terms of compensation, hours worked, other compensation, and total compensation paid to each employee. when an employee returns from fmla leave, he or she must be restored either to the same job or one that is virtually identical in", "the term \"ergo\" can be defined to mean \"as a result\" or \"for that reason.\"similar words include \"therefore,\" \"hence,\" \"consequently,\" \"so,\" \"thus,\" and \"accordingly.\" you can use \"ergo\" when describing the relationship between a cause and an effect. example: i love reading; ergo, i have a large library at home.; , it can also be described as an adverbial conjunction. the two parts of speech are interchangeable and essentially describe words that share properties of both adverbs and conjunctions. an adverb is a term that modifies a verb or an adjective. a conjunction word that is used to connect two sentences, clauses, or ideas. a conjunctive adverb is a word that modifies the verb of an independent clause in a way that demonstrates a connection to another independent clause. example: i love reading; ergo, i have a large library at home. in this sentence, \"ergo\" modifies the verb \"have\" in the independent clause, “i have a large library at home.” it also connects the clause beginning with \"i have\" to the independent clause, \"i love reading,\" and indicates that the latter is a result of the former. , this does not mean that you cannot use the term \"ergo.\" it does, however, mean that you should be cautious about using it. using it too often can seem forced, pretentious, or unnatural. since there are other terms that can be used in the same way, like \"therefore,\" you may want to ask yourself if \"ergo\" is the best choice before you use it. in spite of the fact that it is an archaic term, \"ergo\" is still used more often than many archaic terms, which does grant it some form of modern relevancy. example: instead of saying, “i love reading; ergo, i have a large library at home,” consider saying, “i love reading; therefore, i have a large library at home.” , this is one correct way to use the word and tends to look the most natural. typically, you use the term to indicate how the information of one clause results from the information in the clause before it. since the two clauses are independent, you need to bridge them together with some form of punctuation. as two independent clauses, they need to be separated with a semicolon rather than a comma. example: she had five cats at home; ergo, anyone allergic to cats never enjoyed staying at her house. ,\"if done correctly, you can also begin a sentence with “ergo.” the term should still be followed by comma, as it is when used with a semicolon. essentially, “ergo” is used in the same way at the beginning of a sentence as it is when used after a semicolon. you're simply splitting the two independent clauses into two separate sentences. example: she had five cats at home. ergo, anyone allergic to cats never enjoyed staying at her house. , the most common mistake people make when using “ergo” is the dreaded comma splice. this occurs when you replace what should be a semicolon with a simple comma. standard coordinating conjunctions can join", "if you are a reporter, you might get a tip for an explosive story. although you may be tempted to rush into print, you should consider confirming the facts of the story with a second source before publishing. sometimes people leak false stories because they have a vendetta against the person.you should corroborate the main facts of the story with a second independent source. take good notes of your fact-checking and document all facts.keep a log in which you write the date you contacted someone, the number you called, and details about what the person said.; , if you intend to publish a potentially defamatory statement, then ask the person for a comment.you don’t have to publish the response, though it could help you.if you write an article or book, you can share a draft with any real person you have written about. ask them if they would recommend changes. , someone can sue you for disclosing private facts that are embarrassing. however, you can defend yourself if those facts are already in the public realm. do research to see if the information you intend to publish has already been published. look at people’s social media accounts. these are often a treasure trove of personal information about someone. document what you find. print out web pages or download photographs that show the information has been publicly disclosed. , you can always publish something if you get the person’s consent. try to have them sign an interview release form.the release form should include the following information in the body of the release: a grant of permission to interview: “i hereby give permission to to interview me and record my voice.” permission to publish the information gathered in the interview: “i further hereby give permission for to use, reuse, publish, and republish the same in whole or in part for any lawful purposes in any and all media, including print, the internet, and broadcast media, and to use my full name in connection therewith.”a release from liability: “i hereby release all right, title, or interest in and to all or any part of my tape-recorded or transcribed interviews and declare that they may be used without any restriction whatsoever and may be copyrighted and published by the said party or entities designated by said party.”a signature line. remember that minors (those under 18) also need a parent or guardian to sign. get a witness to sign. a release is always stronger if you have a witness sign it as well. , you can protect yourself by describing the person in such a way that other people can’t recognize who you are writing about. make sure that you change more than one or two details. for example, if you are writing about a professor of russian literature at a local university, you shouldn’t just change her hair color. instead, you should think about changing:age profession time place physical description , you are protected from a defamation claim if you offer an opinion

adjustable hole through which light passes on its way from the subject, through the lens, to the film (or digital sensor). like the pinhole in a pinhole camera, it blocks rays of light except those that would, even without a lens, tend to form an inverted image by passing through that central point to a corresponding point in the opposite direction on the film. with a lens, it also blocks rays of light that would pass through far from the center, where the lens glass may less closely approximate (usually with various easy-to-make spherical surfaces) the shapes that would focus it perfectly (usually much more complex aspherical surfaces), causing aberrations. because every camera has an aperture, usually adjustable, and if not, at least has the edges of the lens as an aperture, the aperture size setting is what is normally called the \"aperture\". f-stop or simply aperture. this is the ratio of the focal length of the lens to the size of the aperture. this kind of measurement is used because a given focal ratio produces the same image brightness, requiring the same shutter speed for a given iso setting (film speed or equivalent sensor light amplification) without regard to focal length. iris diaphragm or simply iris. this is the device most cameras use to form and adjust the aperture. it consists of a series of overlapping thin metal blades that can swing toward the center of a hole in a flat metal ring. it forms a central hole that is perfectly round wide open, when the blades are out of the way, and constricts by pushing the blades toward the center of that hole to form a smaller polygonal hole (which may have curved edges). if your camera uses interchangeable lenses, or it is a \"bridge\" type digital camera, the lens will have an adjustable diaphragm iris. if your camera is a shirt-pocket sized \"point-and-shoot\" compact model, especially a lower priced model, it may have a \"neutral density filter\" instead of a diaphragm iris. also, if the camera's mode dial includes \"m\", \"tv\", and \"av\", it almost certainly has an actual diaphragm iris; this applies even on small compact models. if the mode dial doesn't include these three settings, the camera might have a diaphragm, or it might only have an nd filter; the only way to know for sure is to read the specifications in the owner's manual, or read a detailed professional review (google your camera's model name with the word \"reviews\", and you will probably find at least two or three reviews on the internet). if your camera uses an nd filter, your ability to \"fine tune\" your settings and control depth of field and bokeh effects will be limited to whatever the fixed aperture of the lens provides. note on mode dial settings: \"m\" stands for \"manual\" - in this mode you have to set both the shutter speed and aperture. \"tv\" is shutter speed", "your city or county has specific laws that determine what claims you can file against the city or county government. all city and county governments have deadlines for filing claims. for example, if you have a personal injury claim against los angeles county, it must be filed within six months of the occurrence that gave rise to the claim. a property damage claim must be filed within one year.the applicable deadline typically can be found by reading your state's statute of limitations law.deadlines for filing a claim for damages or a lawsuit against the local government typically are far shorter than they would be if you were suing a private business or individual.; , before you start filling out the form, make sure you have any necessary documentation or other evidence that supports your claim.for example, if your car was damaged when you drove over a pothole in a city street, your evidence might include photos of the damage to your car or an estimate from a mechanic for the cost of repairs. estimates, receipts, or police reports all must be included to help establish your damages as part of your claim., your city or county typically will have a form available for you to file a claim for damages.you can get a claim form by visiting the city or county government website, or by calling or visiting your city or county clerk's office.follow all instructions provided regarding the formatting and filling out of the form. for example, you typically will be instructed that hand-written answers should be printed legibly using blue or blank ink.if you're filing a personal injury claim, you may be required to fill out and file a medical release form in addition to your claim form., once you've completed your form, you must submit it to the government agency or department responsible for your damages. before you send your form, double-check your information to make sure everything is complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge. you must sign your form under penalty of perjury and may be charged with a crime for submitting a false claim.the city government's website or the city's customer service line should be able to tell you where to submit your claim. for example, if you have a claim for damages against the city of seattle, you must file your form at the city clerk's office in city hall.forms for damages that occurred on city streets or on public transportation typically must be filed with the city or metropolitan transit authority., if your city or county has any additional requirements such as hearings or interviews related to your claim, make sure you follow up as necessary. once you file your claim, the city or a claim adjuster working for the city will review and investigate your claim.you may be contacted for further information during the process of investigation. expect the city to take anywhere from 60 days to several months to send you a report on the investigation and a decision on your claim.in most cases, the city or county will resolve", "the hocks are the rabbit equivalent of an ankle joint, and the area that's affected is the length of the paw from the hock to the tips of the toes. to check your rabbit, gently roll the rabbit onto its back so that you can see the underside of the rabbit's back legs.take care not to force the rabbit over, as this can damage their spine. you may find it helps to cover the rabbit's eyes with a towel as this has a naturally subduing effect. it's a good idea to sit on the floor when checking your rabbit, just in case they wriggle and you let go.; , there is a sliding scale of severity from fur loss right through to full thickness pressure sores with secondary infections.in its mildest form, the rabbit may lose the fur on the surface in contact with the ground, and the skin may look slightly red.if the problem has progressed a bit further, the area may become puffy or swollen, the skin may be obviously reddened or even cracked or scabby. even further, it can develop into a sore or ulcer form. an ulcer is when the surface of the skin breaks open, often in response to pressure, such as is the case with bed sores., unfortunately, once the surface of the skin is broken, this provides an entry route for bacteria and infections. to check for this, look for a weeping discharge, often consisting of pus, from the sore.the area may smell unpleasant. usually there is significant swelling and large areas of skin loss from the lower surface of the limb. once the discharge is cleaned away you may even be able to see underlying structures through the gap in the skin, such as tendons or ligaments. , this rabbit will be very uncomfortable and reluctant to move around. unfortunately this worsens the problem because the rabbit spends longer in one spot, which may be damp and contributing to the sore hocks. thus a classic vicious circle develops.in some cases the infection spreads into the joints or even the bones. this is very painful and the rabbit will be reluctant to move. when it does move, it will be with an abnormal gait or a limp. the pain and discomfort may also stop the rabbit from eating. , keep the rabbit's claws short, so that the foot lies at a normal angle. also give the rabbit a deep bed of soft straw, so that the injured area is cushioned a bit. be sure to keep the rabbit's cage or hutch clean as well. if the hock injury was caused by the rabbit sitting in urine, clean the area and make sure it is no longer sitting in its filth. , if you discover your rabbit has sore hocks then seek veterinary attention. the vet will look at the hock area and assess whether the skin is damaged. if it is, the vet will also assess whether a secondary infection is present. if the answer is yes, the vet will investigate whether the infection has", "for this recipe you will need the following items: paring knife zester saucepan candy thermometer candy molds airtight storage container.; , start by peeling the ginger with a paring knife or vegetable peeler. fresh ginger is available at most supermarkets in the produce section. ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and is commonly used in cough remedies as an effective antihistamine and chest decongestant.cut the ginger into very thin slices using a paring knife. use a zester to get at least 1 teaspoon of lemon zest. , bring this to a boil over high heat.you will know when the pot is at a full boil when you have a constant stream of large bubbles coming to the surface and a good deal of steam. once the pot has come to a full boil, reduce the heat to low. , then remove the ginger and cinnamon stick. the easiest way to remove the spices is with a strainer. place a strainer into a clean saucepan. pour the hot mixture through the strainer. the ginger and cinnamon will be left in the strainer and the liquid will be caught in the clean saucepan underneath. , bring this mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. honey has been studied in clinical trials. it has been proven to be as effective as cough syrup in suppressing coughs. you will want the sugar to dissolve. you can tell if the sugar is dissolved if you take a spoon of the liquid and cannot see any grains of sugar in it. once the sugar is dissolved, you will use a candy thermometer to get this syrup to the hard-crack candy stage. , you will use this to monitor the heat.the candy liquid will need to be heated to a high temperature in order to harden into lozenges. it is very important that you closely watch the temperature of the syrup so it doesn't burn onto the saucepan or become too hot to form hard cough drops. the goal temperature for hard-crack lozenges is 300-305 degrees fahrenheit. , it will rise quickly as you cook the liquid.as the liquid rises in temperature, it may darken. this is expected as the sugar in the syrup caramelizes. when the candy thermometer reaches 300-305 degrees, remove the liquid from heat. you will now add the final ingredients before pouring the mixture to cool in candy molds. , as you add the juice, it may cause the hot liquid to splash. stir completely to make sure the liquid is evenly mixed. , you can use unflavored cooking spray to do so. carefully pour the hot liquid into the molds. take care to fill only the small candy mold and not to spill too much of the liquid over the top each. this recipe will make about 50 small lozenge sized pieces. , this will take an hour or more.when the cough drops are cool, crack them out of the molds onto wax paper. to crack the drops out of the candy molds, tap the mold gently on a hard surface. the cough drops", "disneyland is large, so buy multiple-day tickets if you want to experience the whole park and resort area. however, if you don't plan to visit both parks, there are also options for just single-day visits. you can buy disneyland tickets from their official site at https://disneyland.disney.go.com/tickets/. , hotel accommodations for onsite hotels (such as the historic disneyland hotel, disney's grand californian hotel & spa and the disney's paradise pier hotel) can be made on disney's disneyland website when you sign in. any offsite accommodation bookings will need to be made separately, and there are many travel websites out there offering deals on air travel, car rental, and hotel stays., there are videos from the point of view of the rider available online for almost all disney rides. check youtube and other similar resources. you won't find quite the same video resources for hotels and all downtown disney attractions, but you can find descriptions and photographs., although this will vary by park (and whether or not there's a early admission option), the parks are generally open from 9am to 10pm pacific time. however, some park events will force it to close much earlier or later than that on select nights. make sure you plan enough time to see it all. your exact trip will vary depending on your goals and the ages/needs of those traveling with you. however, planning enough time for everything is crucial, if you want to see it all. if possible, schedule at least one night at each park so that you can experience both of disneyland's nighttime shows: \"wonderful world of color\" at the disney california adventure park and \"remember...dreams come true fireworks spectacular\" at disneyland. if the nighttime fireworks aren't being shown, there are still some good light parades twice per night; these run between fantasyland and a location near the firehouse on main street, usa near the park entrance. park maps can be found in their entirety at

that your belongings can be tucked away on rides., anaheim is generally warm, but can have most misty-foggy summer mornings. rain is rare but can be intense when it comes., if you are staying at an offsite hotel in anaheim, there is the anaheim resort transportation that is offered from many of hotel chains that is offered for more than half off the cost of parking near disneyland. however, if you are coming from elsewhere or just plan on parking with your own car, disneyland has their own parking structure just to the west of the disneyland resort and to the west of downtown disney. the address to the parking structure is 1313 s disneyland dr, anaheim, ca 92802.the cost to park your car at this park is about $17, and even more for different types of vehicles., the tram will take you

learn how to control the pitch and tone of your voice.sing from the stomach instead of the throat. singing from the throat is like a speaker without a box. you don´t get the fullness of the sound. it will sound squeaky when you try to hit some good notes, especially the high ones. so, mainly use the throat as a conduit. work on hitting high notes.diaphragm pressure is the key to creating the heavier vocals used by rock singers.your diaphragm controls the air that goes through your vocal chords. some pressure in your diaphragm can push just enough air through your vocal chords to get that heavy grit out. practice changing the pitch. experiment with opening and closing your throat, lips, and teeth to see how much control you have over the sound. closing your throat can add harshness or grit, while opening it can increase volume and improve timbre. lips and teeth affect not only the character (what phonics you make) but also how the vibration of your vocal chords is translated into the air around you.; , as you become more controlled and proficient in using your voice, try to expand your musical vocabulary by learning about the basics of music and singing. vocal warm-ups, scales, intervals, and timbre are all helpful things to familiarize yourself with but remember the first rule of rock: do it your way. choose your style of rock. abandon musical lyricism, tone, and articulation. rock singing should be rather ambiguous in rhythm, lyrics, and pitch. that is the essence of hard rock. , don't try to learn from a cd or machine. get a great teacher. many professional rock singers have done so. a voice coach will help you develop your voice and can give you tips in how to protect your voice.rock has a vast array of voice styles and methods. an experienced coach can appropriately assess your improvement. a coach will help you improve your vocal range. there are no shortcuts. it takes a long time to learn to sing well. you might have natural talent, but that will take you only so far. you have to have a solid technique to have a stable career. that is why there are so many \"flash in the pan\" performers. they have no technique, and their voices crash and burn quickly. , you do have to be able to hold enough breath to push a note loud enough for a microphone or audience to hear it.focusing on core exercises such as abdominal, chest, and back muscles will help you tighten your core in order to focus on your breath. cardio exercise such as biking, jogging, jump rope, and even brisk walking can improve the amount of breath you have for holding notes and can also help a lot if you're an active singer who does a lot of jumping around or headbanging while singing. take care of your voice. while some singers can smoke and drink and sound", "remember that this is really not the biggest problem in the world to have. everything is relative. if a little embarrassment is the worst problem you will ever experience, you’re lucky. if you become flustered and react intensely, this can spur a reaction in others, creating an uncomfortable situation for everyone. instead, try to keep your cool.it’s possible that no one will notice or be able to see anyway. it might feel wet to you, but the pee stain may be barely visible to other people around you because of where it’s located. try to stay relaxed and slip away. if someone does see, remain calm. people often react to embarrassment by becoming flustered, tearful, stuttering, and acting upset overall. this makes the people around you feel awkward as well, causing a tense situation. while it can be incredibly embarrassing to have an accident in public, staying calm can help smooth things over. if anyone notices, try to react with a smile and take it with a grain of salt. you can proceed to do things to help quell your embarrassment. , how you respond to something can affect how other people around you respond to it, so your attitude can make the situation more or less embarrassing. adopt a confident attitude, and try to laugh off the mistake.in hindsight, embarrassing events are easy to laugh off. people often share embarrassing stories at cocktail parties. in the moment, however, laughing can be hard. try to remind yourself you will live down this moment. this may make you feel more comfortable laughing. even if it feels uncomfortable, try your best to laugh it off. say something like, “can you believe i just did that? i guess your joke was really funny.” speak with confidence, and downplay the significance of what just happened. enlist a friend's help. if you're feeling sensitive, it may be difficult to laugh at yourself. try to turn to a trusted friend and encourage him or her to laugh with you. make a joke at your own expense and say, \"am i right?\" if your friend joins in, the conversation can go from uncomfortable to fun and lighthearted. , if you want to overcome embarrassment, work on moving forward. instead of dwelling on what has just occurred, keep your mind in the present. you peed your pants, and now you must deal. ruminating on the embarrassment will block your ability to smoothly cope with the situation.try to silence the voice in your head. you may be inclined to think something like, \"i can't believe you just did that. how humiliating.\" try to ignore the words of self judgment. instead, focus on what you can do now, in the present, to deal with the situation. keep pulling your attention to the present as need be. remind yourself you need to get to a bathroom, cover the stain, or laugh it off with those around you. , you may feel you'll never live down peeing yourself in public. however, try to remind yourself of embarrassing things you've done in the past. this", "the incubation period for lyme's disease is 2 to 5 months. this means that it could take your dog several months to develop symptoms after he has been bit.if you find a tick on your dog, remove it and then monitor your dog for symptoms over the next several months.; , dogs with lyme's disease develop several non-specific signs of ill health. these signs include: fever: a dog's temperature is normally 37.9 to 39.0 celsius. a dog is considered feverish if his temperature is above 39.5 celsius. the dog may radiate an unusual amount of heat from his body. his paws and nose may feel hot to the touch. he may pant, even in a cool room, and his coat may look dull. anorexia: this includes a loss of appetite. a dog that does not eat for several days is in no immediate danger, other than losing weight, but it is a significant general sign of ill health, especially in a normally hungry dog. depression: this means the dog loses interest in things he would normally find exciting. this means he chooses to lay in his bed, rather than go for a walk or come running to greet you when you come in from work. , lyme's disease has a strong link to lameness. the borrelia may grow in your dog’s joints or muscles. when this happens, your dog’s body will begin to fight the invasion, which will cause the area to become inflamed. this inflammation can lead to soreness, pain, and lameness. while lameness can occur for reasons other than lyme's disease (such as arthritis, infection, sprains, and cancer), the symptoms commonly associated with lyme's disease-induced lameness include: acute lameness: this is another way of saying a sudden-onset lameness. your dog may have been fine the previous day, but wakes up the next feeling dull, feverish, and with marked lameness in one or more legs. joint pain: the affected joint(s) become swollen and warm. they are also tender or painful when touched. if in doubt, compare your dog’s lame leg to his other corresponding leg. the lame leg may look larger or feel hotter than the other. walking stiffly: if the joints in the spine are affected, your dog may walk stiffly with his back hunched and arched. when you stroke his back, he may flinch as if in pain. , the lameness caused by lyme’s disease often lasts for only 3 to 4 days, and responds readily to antibiotic therapy with oxytetracycline antibiotics. if left untreated the lameness may resolve but the dog is at risk of going on to develop later clinical signs of the disease (this is discussed in the next section). , when the body mounts an immune response, the lymph nodes may become flooded with cells ready to fight infection, which causes them to physically enlarge. it is difficult for untrained people to feel these lymph nodes in their dogs, but if they are swollen you may be able to see quail's eggs sized bumps under the skin. when you run fingers over the bumps you", "owning any business is a extraordinary commitment. to make it as an entrepreneur, you must be willing to work seven days out of the week. this will often involve long, sleepless nights of coming up with new ideas and working out solutions to problems that spring up along the way. before you take on the challenge, be sure that you have the determination to stick with it.your new distillery won’t be making any money in its infancy. unless you have a benefactor or receive a sizable business loan, you’ll likely have to juggle the responsibilities of devising a business strategy while working other jobs to pay the rent. speak to other entrepreneurs who have opened their own distilleries and ask if they have any helpful advice to share with you.; , there’s a lot of legal regulation surrounding breweries, distilleries and other businesses that manufacture and sell alcohol. first, you’ll have to obtain a distiller’s permit from the appropriate government agency. following that, you’ll need to be approved for a liquor license and other applicable permits at the state or local level. without the proper paperwork, you won’t be able to move forward with opening your distillery.those living in the united states can visit the website of the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau to complete the application process for a distiller's permit, as well as request additional information and materials.the legal processes involved with starting a distillery are straightforward, but can be time-consuming. it’s best to get started as soon as you’ve made up your mind to pursue your goal., to be the best you can possibly be at what you do, you’ll need to become a walking encyclopedia of liquor-related knowledge. sample as many liquors as you can, visit other distilleries and keep your eyes and ears open for new developments in the industry. always be looking to expand your knowledge on both the practical and business end of things.get in the habit of trying new brands and brews regularly. you should have a wealth of firsthand experience to be able to articulate the differences between your product and others. attend distillery festivals and special events whenever possible. these types of events usually feature an enormous selection of craft spirits, and can provide a great hands-on learning opportunity. , what can you do to make your distillery stand out among your competitors? you might plan on employing an inventive hybrid distilling method or incorporating never-before-seen ingredients into the mix. or perhaps you’re determined to introduce people who don’t drink gin to the beverage in an enjoyable way. whatever your approach may be, you should aim to proceed with a clear purpose in mind.if you’re unable to come up with a clear answer to this question, you’ll likely have a harder time turning your brand into something truly special. while trying other liquors, make a list of what works, what’s missing and what could be done better. direct comparison will put you on the right track to crafting a beverage that hits all the right notes., opening a distillery involves", "because of the various disciplines involved in training for an adventure race, you should give yourself plenty of time to prepare. starting early allows you to get your body in peak condition before you focus on specific skills.you will start with base training, which increases your body's cardiovascular fitness and trains you for endurance sports. after a month or two of base training, you will move to more intense phases, in which you are actively training for the race while also strengthening your skills and technique in the various disciplines that are tested during an adventure race. allowing at least six months to train for your first adventure race ensures that you can both train and participate in the adventure race safely, and that your body is in peak condition.; , a strong foundation of aerobic fitness ensures you have the strength to endure long hours on even the toughest endurance course. start your training slow to build your aerobic fitness and make your body more efficient.working at a lower intensity builds your body's aerobic fitness and trains you for endurance. your body will burn fat rather than carbs, which helps you sustain energy during endurance activities. ideally, you'll want to spend at least 12 weeks in the base training phase of your training. after that, you can work into the build phase, when you improve your skills in the various disciplines. you'll gradually ramp up the intensity of your training sessions until you reach your peak within weeks of the race itself. invest in a heart-rate monitor (if you don't already have one) and keep track of your heart rate while conditioning. during base training, you shouldn't move beyond the first two zones, the recovery and endurance zones. this equates to between 50 and 70 percent of your maximum heart rate. at your peak training level, you'll be working at around 80 percent of your maximum heart rate. , since adventure racing is an endurance sport, your conditioning workouts need to be at least as long as the race itself is going to be. training yourself to go longer will make a shorter race easier and give you more room to increase your pace.if your adventure race is more than 12 hours long, use a marathon training plan. try to do most of your running on trails rather than on a paved road. if your adventure race is less than 12 hours in duration, you can follow a half-marathon plan. you can spend as little as three or four days a week training, but you may want to train for five or six days a week, particularly when you are doing lower intensity exercise during your base training stage. remember that an adventure race is an endurance event. you're not going to train for a 12-hour race by working out 20 minutes a day three or four days a week. not training enough is a good way to ensure you'll get wiped out – or worse, injured – within the first few hours of the race. , when you have a", "talking too loudly is a time-tested way of annoying people in public almost anywhere you go. you can talk loudly on the bus, on a plane, or especially in a coffee shop while people are trying to get work done. it's especially annoying if you talk loudly on the phone, acting like no one else is around. if you reveal personal information, or just make really obnoxious comments, then you are guaranteed to annoy the people around you. if someone asks you to be quiet, you should nod vigorously and apologize, and continue like before.; , ah, the phone. probably the most annoying device you have in your possession. if you're at work or school, or even just having lunch at a cafe, leave it on, preferably with a very annoying song that comes on whenever it rings. think something like, \"taking care of business\" or \"who let the dogs out?\" so that when your phone rings, everyone is utterly distracted. you can even make this sound your alarm, so it sounds like someone is calling when no one is. bonus points if it takes you forever to find your phone so everyone gets to hear the entirety of the annoying sound or ring tone. it's also pretty annoying to put your phone on vibrate. you may think that this is almost the same as putting your phone on silent, when in fact, everyone can hear your phone vibrate and can get annoyed by it, especially if you're in a particularly quiet place. this is perfect when you're having a long textual exchange with a friend, so that your phone will go off every few seconds. , though you should avoid approaching someone who may lash out at you or get very angry, if you really want to be annoying, then you can try to strike up a convo with someone who is obviously very busy, whether that person is studying for a test, working on his novel on his computer, or just reading with intense concentration. act like you're completely oblivious and are just looking to chat someone up. when the person answers in one-word answers, ignore this and try to keep the conversation going. you can say, \"what are you reading? i heard that book was pretty lame,\" or make other offensive comments about what the person is doing as an opener. talk on and on about yourself, making eye contact so the other person would feel bad about turning you away. , this is another way to be pretty irritating in public. repeatedly drop your books, spill your coffee, or just generally act like a mess who can't keep track of his or her stuff. the more you spill, the merrier. you can also bring shaving cream and when someone gets up to go to the bathroom you can poor the shaving cream all over the persons seat and this will really drive the person nuts and spill it all over the persons laptop. make as much racket as you can so people feel forced to look up and", "if you wait until your baby is sleepy to start the routine, then your baby will be overtired by the time they are ready for bed. at nap times and bedtime, babies have a \"sleep window\" when they are just starting to get tired, but are not so tired that they've become irritable. once your baby passes their “sleep window,” their body begins to produce cortisol, which is a stress hormone that will make it more difficult for them to fall asleep and to stay asleep.every baby is different, but if your baby is over 4 months old, they might be ready to sleep anywhere between 5 and 7:30pm. note that newborns don’t have a scheduled bedtime since they are still developing circadian rhythms. until your baby is a few months old, it won’t be necessary to establish a night time routine. , this is not necessarily a mandatory step, but many parents use a nightly bath as a way to help their babies understand that they are getting ready for bed.a warm bath is relaxing and also a good bonding experience for you and your baby. , giving your baby a massage will help them relax even more and is a great way to bond with your baby. you can use baby lotion or baby oil, and massage your baby’s arms, legs, belly, and neck for 10 to 15 minutes after bath time.massage their legs by gently wrapping your hand around their thigh and then sliding your hand down from the thigh to the ankle. repeat this on the other leg. use a gentle clockwise motion with your fingertips to massage their belly. you can massage baby's arms using the same technique used for the legs. wrap your hand around your baby’s upper arm and then slide your hand down to their wrist. repeat on the other arm. to massage your baby’s neck, support your baby’s head and upper body in one hand. with the other hand, place your thumb on one side of your baby’s neck, and then wrap your hand under baby’s neck and place your index finger and middle finger on the other side. use your fingers to gently massage in a circular motion. , if you have a brand new baby, you may choose to swaddle your baby as this is very soothing for infants. if your baby is older than two months, you should dress them in pajamas based on the temperature. if it is during the warm summer months (over 75 degrees fahrenheit or 23 c) then your baby probably only needs one layer of clothing. if it is under 75f (23 c) then your baby may need a few more layers to stay warm.a good rule of thumb is that your baby should be dressed in one layer more than you need to be comfortable in the room., dimming the lights will signal to your baby that it’s time to sleep. you can do this by turning on a soft lamp in your baby’s nursery. if you have an overhead light with a dimmer", "orient your xbox on a flat, sturdy surface so the front, where the power button is located, is pointing to your right. the xbox should stand on its narrow end with the vent facing up.this cleaning process can be somewhat long and tedious, especially the first time. smear some war paint under your eyes and get ready to wage war on the dirt and dust clogging your xbox.; , gently slide the screwdriver into the farthest right vent slot on the vent. pry the vent with firm, moderate pressure until it partially pops free. use your fingers to continue prying the vent up with moderate pressure until it releases.when prying with your screwdriver, use your free hand to assist the screwdriver by pressing upwards on the end of the vent. , use your fingernail to lift the lip of the silver or black panel border at the right back corner of the xbox. in the space on the inside of the border, there will be three release tabs that look like small slots: one on the right, one at the middle, and one on the left.when lifting the border part of the xbox, you’ll likely need to continue exerting pressure on it with your hand to keep the release tabs accessible. there are six total release tabs for each side panel, three along each long side. these tabs are positioned similarly for both side panels., insert your screwdriver into the slot at the right, back corner. press forward slightly while prying up on the panel with your free hand. when the tab disengages, that corner of the side panel should pull up and out.disengage the release tabs in sequence. start with one end, then disengage the middle tab, then finish with the opposite end. repeat this for the remaining three opposite side release tabs. as more tabs are disengaged, more of the panel should slide free. when all tabs are released, the side panel will pull free of the xbox. to keep parts from getting lost or accidentally damaged, refasten the vent to the side panel by pressing the vent back into place on it. you should feel it click when it is secured. , in the area under the side panel, you will see a small square shaped part on the left side held into a usb port by a screw. this is the wireless card. use a phillips screwdriver to unfasten the screw, then pull the card out of the usb slot., flip the xbox so the side with the removed vent/side panel is facing down. use your finger to pry free the access door on the left side. in the same fashion you removed the first vent, use your screwdriver and free hand to pry free the vent to the right of the access door., the release tabs for this panel are similar to the first side panel you removed, but the tab above the access door will be a little larger and the one below it a little smaller. in the same fashion as the previous side panel,", "to ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the cupcakes, set the temperature to 350 degrees fahrenheit (177 degrees celsius) and allow it to fully heat. next, take a 12 cup muffin tin and fill the compartments with paper cupcake liners.keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the proper temperature. it will usually flash an indicator light or beep to alert you.; , add 1 ⅓ cups (167 g) of all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of baking soda, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of baking powder, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground cinnamon, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground ginger, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground cloves, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground allspice, and ¼ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of salt to a large bowl. stir until the ingredients are fully blended, and set aside.if you don’t like the flavor of ground cloves, you can substitute an equal amount of ground allspice. , in a separate large bowl, beat together ½ cup (115 g) of softened butter and ½ cup (100 g) of packed dark brown sugar with a hand mixer set to medium. blend the mixture until it’s light and fluffy.you can use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment in place to mix the batter. you can also mix the batter by hand, but it will require more time and effort. you can substitute light brown sugar for the dark brown sugar if you prefer. , when the butter and sugar mixture is light and fluffy, mix in 1 egg. blend until it is totally incorporated into the butter and sugar.it’s a good idea to break the egg into a separate dish before adding it to the butter mixture. that way, if the egg is bad, you won’t ruin all of the batter. make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary to ensure that all of the egg is blended into the butter and sugar. , once the egg is fully mixed into the batter, add ½ cup (118 ml) of water and ½ cup (156 g) of molasses. beat the mixture together with the hand mixer on medium for 30 seconds to 1 minutes.don’t worry if the molasses isn’t fully incorporated into the mixture. it’s normal for the batter to have a piece-y consistency at this point. , turn the hand mixer’s speed to low, and gradually add the dry ingredients into the batter. beat the mixture until the dry ingredients are just combined with the wet ingredients.be careful not to overmix the batter. you may wind up with tough, chewy cupcakes. scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as you’re mixing to ensure that the ingredients are blended. , when the batter is completely mixed, spoon it into the lined muffin tin. add enough batter to fill the cups ⅔’s of the way.don’t overfill the muffin tin. the muffins may puff up and bake into one another if the compartments are too full. , place", "the first thing you should do is to clear up the area around your rose bush. weeds growing around your rose bush may be sucking up all the nutrients in the soil. fallen leaves and flowers should be picked up by hand instead of raked. raking “disrupts” the soil and may expose weed seeds to sunlight, therefore urging them to sprout. always remove any dead flowers and fallen leaves from the ground around your rose bush. these may look harmless, but if they get wet and do not dry properly, mold will fester and may infect your rose bush.; , dead flowers and leaves that are still attached to the rose bush can either be plucked off or pruned using shears as closest to the cane as possible. , weeds around your rose bush should also be removed. make sure you have a firm grasp of the weed, as close to the roots as possible and give it a good tug. roots should be removed or else they will sprout again in as little as a matter of days. , you should consider pruning your rose bush as soon as the weather starts to warm up—usually right after the last frost so that your rose bush is not at risk of being damaged by another frost or sudden rise in temperature. you should also prune your rose bush when the buds start to swell. check your rose bush for signs of new leaf growth and if the buds are starting to grow red in color. sometimes, pruning depends on the type of rose you have. there are some roses that require pruning while dormant, whilst other roses require pruning after they bloom. a rose bush should be pruned while it's dormant if you notice that it produces new growth in the spring and the blooms come from this new growth. however, if the blooms come from the old canes, then it should be pruned after it blooms instead. , you do not want to cause more harm to the canes by using blunt shears. also try to avoid cutting at a straight line. instead, try cutting at an angle because it will help the cane heal quicker. don't hesitate to cut off the all dead and diseased looking canes in your rose bush, before it starts infecting the healthy ones. also prune old canes to allow new growth , prune the center of the bush to allow maximum air circulation to prevent fungi growth due to accumulating moisture. this also allows for better exposure to the sun. prune the growth on main canes that don't grow to a reasonable thickness. if the growth is no thicker than a pencil, then it should be pruned. prune old and dead canes down to where it meets fresh ones. you can tell that a cane is dead or diseased if it has dead leaves and is “woody”, characterized by a dried and brown appearance. , you can tell if a bush is overgrown if it looks like a huge shrub of intertwined canes—basically a tangled", "the people you allow in your life can either shore you up during the difficult times, or they can create a drag down on your mental and physical well being. scientists have found that people with a strong, healthy circle of friends tend to be happier and live longer.social connections, not money or prestige, are what truly matter. only have people in your life who make you the best version of yourself. some places to find friends are community events that are important to you: social justice groups, religious communities, volunteering opportunities, a class to learn a new skill. the internet can also be a good place to meet people with similar values and interests and social media has made it easier to stay in contact with people all around the world. don't forget about your friends. this is especially true during the first stages of a new romantic relationship or when you're busy with work. make sure that you take time out to maintain your important friendships (like going out for a quick coffee date, or even just sending them a letter or email asking how they are and checking in with them). \"break up\" with bad friends. people who don't listen to you, or only care about their own life, or who treat you poorly (talk about you behind your back, who belittle you, or don't support you) simply aren't worth spending time with. it's best not to make a big, dramatic production out of it; simply let the association fizzle. but if your bad friend senses something happening, you might sit down with them and explain why you're backing away from the friendship. appreciate the people who have your back. this could be your friends, your family, people at work, all the people who have helped support you in hard times and enjoyed good times with you. make sure the people that you love and trust know how you feel about them.; , there's this idea out there that, no matter what you do, 1/3 of the people you meet in life will love you unconditionally; 1/3 of the people you meet will hate you unapologetically; and 1/3 of the people you meet simply won't care about you one way of the other.a lot of people who appreciate this idea think that it's not worth it to worry about the 2/3 of people who don't care for you or don't care about you. instead, focus on strengthening relationships you have with the 1/3 of people who actually like you for who you are. , it can be really hard to let people know that you're having a difficult time and that you might need a hand with things, but you shouldn't have to struggle through things by yourself. this problematic attitude of extreme independence is especially prevalent in western culture. if you're having a hard time, or even if you just need a hand moving a couch, ask your trusted friends. if they are actually good friends, they will be more than willing to give you a hand. (and", "there is no home remedy or medication that you can give to a dog suffering to bloat. the treatment is surgical, to decompress and reposition the stomach. for this procedure, time is of the essence. because of this, if you suspect bloat, take your dog to the vet immediately. your first action should be to phone the vet to warn them you are in the way in, and then take your dog directly to the clinic. if your normal veterinarian's office is closed, for instance the incident happens in the evening, take your dog to an emergency veterinarian.; , the first thing your vet will likely do is put the dog on a drip and give the dog high-rate intravenous fluids in order to control the shock and protect organs from shutting down. after this initial stabilization, the vet may try and pass a stomach tube.if the vet is able to pass a stomach tube then it provides an escape route for the gas, and to stomach pump out the gut contents. if the dog is co-operative, they may try to put the tube in using a gag (to stop the dog biting the stomach tube), although in many cases sedation is needed. sometimes if the twist is not a full 360 degrees, passing a stomach tube and then rolling the dog over can correct the twist. if it's not possible to pass a stomach tube the vet passes a large bore needle or a special catheter through the body wall into the stomach as an emergency measure to relieve the gas pressure.this buys some time and helps stabilize the dog. , it is essential that the dog has the stomach repositioned, and this can only be done by a laparotomy. the dog is given a general anesthetic and the vet opens into the belly. the direction of twist is identified and the stomach counter-rotated. once in a normal position, the vet checks to see if any part of the stomach wall needs resecting as the tissue is dead. in addition, the spleen gets dragged out of position with the stomach and may need removing.the vet will flush out the repositioned stomach either via a stomach tube, or by incising direct into the stomach. since there is a risk of re-twisting, the vet may opt to give an anesthetic and perform a preventative procedure called a gastropexy. this involves suturing the stomach to the body wall in such a way that it can't physically flip over again., the period immediately after surgery is a dangerous time, as toxins flood into the bloodstream once the stomach is back in position. this can lead to irregular heart beats and a possible heart attack. the vet will monitor the patient and keep them on an intravenous drip to try and correct any rhythm disturbances with intravenous drugs.after the in-hospital recovery period, you will need to care for your dog as it recovers fully at home. give it lots of love and attention but treat it gently and let it rest. follow your veterinarian's suggestions for", "do they have a policy? if so, have a read! what is it saying? does is specify certain colours of socks or tights?; , for example, blazers might be required. try jazzing it up a bit by pulling off all the boring black buttons and sewing on multicoloured star and lady bird buttons! there certainly wasn't anything about that in the policy!!! , have solid pieces such as a skirt, a pair of trousers and 2 or 3 shirts or blouses. how could those be modified to be different, yet acceptable? how about buying a fitted blouse or having a slightly shorter or longer sleeve length? why not add a belt for instant glamour? if you had a jumper as many schools do in the winter you could roll or fold your sleeves up so your shirt rolls up it, creating a white cuff at your elbow which is very fashionable at the moment. could you go for a different type of trousers? there are plenty to choose from, wide leg, pedal-pushers or shorts (if you're very brave and your school allows it!) what's your fave style of trousers out side of school? try this style with your uniform... some schools may even allow black skinny jeans as long as they are very plain. , love them or don't care about them, they can make or break an outfit. try black converse or pumps or doc marten boots. have a look at what others are getting away with and explore! remember to keep it comfortable, you'll be moving about all day. so girls that may mean choosing a lower heel or ballet pumps! , hair is one of the main things we remember about people. we remember people with waist length hair afros, in fact anything unique like colour always gets remembered! think about someone at school - i bet you can remember their hair in detail! how they wear it, what colour it is and so on. so experiment. try different braids, styles from other countries and different techniques such as using paper or rags to curl your hair. (it works! google it!) there has never been so many products and ways to style your hair so get out there and experiment! many schools may not agreed to false colours, gels or extensions, but there are plenty of accessories you can dress your hair up with! , girls will know all about this one. but what about the guys? try finding a signature baseball cap (take it off indoors, to avoid a telling off) or a wrist sweatband that has an interesting motif. both guys and girls can wear scarves, what ever colour. cute guys can get away with more feminine colours, rocker boys could wear a thin scarf and simply cold guys can wrap up their crushes in thick wooly scarves! girls can wear any type of scarf they like as there are many out there on the market, from ornate easter looking ones to stripy wooly ones, there's bound to be something to suit your style! you can add", "having a website for your business is crucial. whether you have a large company that sells lots of merchandise, and you need an ecommerce component, or you’re a small entrepreneur who sells items from your home. a business website promotes your company and allows customers a way to engage with you. before you can build your website, decide what purpose it will serve. ask, then answer the question: \"what am i selling?\" you may be selling products that are also in physical stores, online only, or a service you provide. the primary product you sell should be what your website displays most prominently. people stay on web pages for an average of 15 seconds. you need to capture attention right away. showcase your product as soon as your site page loads. if you sell clothing or furniture, consider placing a large slider towards the top of the homepage that showcases some of your best products. if you sell a service like construction and repair, or have a restaurant, consider a large image at the top that shows viewers what to expect from coming to you.think like your customer. ask yourself what you would hope to find from coming to a site like your's. provide those solutions as soon as you can on your homepage.; , if you are making your own business website, chances are you provide somewhat of a niche service, but you can take inspiration from larger companies’ sites. say you have a small design studio where you make and refurbish furniture. look at the sites of larger, national companies to see how those sites look and operate. what kind of products are featured, how are the home pages are laid out, and are these sites easy to navigate? do these sites make it easy to find what you are looking for? do they provide you with an enticing experience? pick out an item on another site and start making the steps to buying it. take notes on how the checkout process works (you don’t actually have to buy anything). write down your impressions. consider making two columns. one for aspects you liked, and one for those you didn't. , before you jump into actually making your website online, you want to create a wireframe. wireframes are simple sketches of your site layout that let you define the information hierarchy of your site. you can make wireframes using specific apps like indesign or balsamiq mockups, using shapes in a word application like microsoft word, or simply sketch on paper. , look back at the other websites you’ve visited and think about what worked and didn’t work.

information in one place will make it easier for your heirs. , many digital assets will have a sentimental value. for example, your twitter account will help your family remember you. however, your twitter account probably has no monetary value. other assets, though, could be worth quite a bit of money. sit down and estimate how much each digital asset is worth. for example, virtual currency accounts have real, monetary value. your successor can withdraw the money. go through each asset and assign a value. if the value is sentimental only, then write “sentimental.” enter this information on your digital inventory., if you want your cyber legacy to last indefinitely, you’ll also want heirs who are savvy when handling digital content. for example, leave your digital photo album to

someone who can close your accounts without blabbing. enter the name of the beneficiary on your digital inventory., on your digital inventory, state what you want done with the account.for example, you might want the beneficiary to close your email accounts. enter this information on your digital inventory spreadsheet. alternately, you might want the beneficiary to copy and then close your youtube account or twitter account. they can then share the material with others. you could also leave it to the beneficiary to decide what to do with the asset. of course, you shouldn’t include any account that prohibits another person from accessing your account. read the terms of service for all digital accounts. some of them prohibit another person from accessing them. , you can make things easy on your heirs by making copies of your cyber legacy on a flash drive or disk. you can then store the flash drive or cd in a safe deposit box or in an at-home safe.in your will, you can designate who can access the box. you may have to continually update your files, which can make it inconvenient. however, think about updating once a year. you might also use an online backup service, such as carbonite.com or idrive.com.however, there’s no guarantee these companies will stay in business indefinitely. accordingly, you might be better off creating copies. , if you become incapacitated,

violations which can trigger homeowners association lawsuits include:you have not paid your fees (“assessments”) to the hoa you have made changes to architecture or landscaping that violate the hoa rules you are not complying with other hoa rules, such as parking in the appropriate spot or restrictions on the kinds of pets you can have; , the complaint should state what your hoa wants the court to do. typically, it can request several different things: a request that you pay money. the hoa can sue you for money damages. for example, you might have been behind on your annual fees. the hoa can sue to get a court judgment against you for the amount you owe, plus interest and late fees. a request to foreclose on your house. if the hoa already got a court order for money damages, then it might put a lien on your home if you don’t pay. in some states, it can then ask the court to allow it to foreclose and sell your house. a request that you stop doing something. the hoa might ask the court to order you to stop doing something. this is called an “injunction.” the hoa might want to stop you from adding onto your house or digging up your front yard. , find your association’s rules. these documents are typically called the declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions (cc&rs).there may also be by-laws and articles of incorporation for the association.take them out and read them closely. you want to be sure that the hoa has interpreted the provisions accurately. the complaint should state which provision you have violated. try to figure out if the hoa is reading the provision reasonably or if there is another interpretation. for example, some language might be vague. an hoa might prohibit “dangerous animals” as pets. if the governing documents do not define “dangerous,” then you can argue that the document does not prohibit your pet pit bull. , your best defense is to hire an attorney to represent you in the lawsuit. an experience lawyer can read your complaint and advise you about your best defenses. to find a lawyer, you can get a referral from anyone else in your association who has been sued by the hoa. the homeowners association will probably have an attorney, which is covered by their insurance.if so, then you should seriously consider hiring a lawyer to represent you. you will be at a competitive disadvantage if you go to trial without a lawyer when the hoa has one. even if you cannot afford an attorney, you will probably benefit from meeting with one for a consultation. many attorneys offer free or reduced price half-hour consultations. during this meeting, the attorney will review the complaint, your hoa’s governing policies, and tell you about possible defenses. , the exact defenses you should raise will depend on your individual circumstances and your", "focusing on more than one thing (multi-tasking) forces your mind to be scattered, this makes it easier for anxiety-producing thoughts to pop up. being mindful means focusing on only one thing and focusing on that thing completely.often we multitask without even realizing it. for example, we eat lunch while checking email or talk on the phone while editing a report. think about what you are about to do before you do it, and then commit to doing just that activity. stop yourself when you find that you have started multitasking and return your focus to your one task. , if your mind is completely occupied with what you are doing, then there is less opportunity for anxiety-inducing thoughts to creep in.when possible, reduce the number of distractions around you so that you can focus only on the task at hand. when it is not possible to reduce distractions, be mindful of them, but don’t let them grab your attention. , getting used to recognize your sensations while make it easier for you to be mindful of them during times of high anxiety and will decrease the number of anxiety-starting thoughts that you have on a regular basis.be aware of what you see, hear, feel, taste, and smell. for example, while cooking dinner, pay attention to the different textures and colors of the ingredients, the sounds of your cooking tools, the aromas that are produced, etc. when brushing your teeth, notice how the toothpaste tastes and smells. how does the toothbrush feel in your hand? pay attention to the feel of it on your teeth, tongue, and gums. , while you are performing your task, think about how performing it makes you feel. think about how the sensations of the task make you feel. you will be able to better recognize and handle your emotions when you are anxious if you make a habit of being aware of them.for example, when you are taking a walk, be aware of your sense of peace and calm. think about how the fresh air in your lungs makes you feel proud that you are taking care of your health. , slowing down helps prevent anxiety by slowing your mind in general. it also gives you the opportunity to halt anxiety by fully focusing on what you are engaged in., the goal of mindfulness is to stay present in the moment. being able to bring your mind back to the moment can decrease the number of anxiety-producing thoughts that enter your head during difficult situations. when you notice that your thoughts have drifted, move them back to your task at hand.for example, you might say to yourself, “i’m worrying about my report that is due next week, but i don't need to think about that right now. i’m going to focus on driving instead.” , although life can often pull you in many different directions, try to practice mindfulness in everything you do. whether it’s washing dishes, eating, journaling, etc., do it mindfully. practicing mindfulness at every opportunity will make it much easier for you to do", "this will help relieve you of those last-minute insane dashes through an entire wardrobe. the things to cover include: what is the event? is it formal, semi-formal, or all-out casual but nice? is it a formal party or are you just casually hanging with your friends? what season is it? what will the weather/temperature probably be on the day/night?; , these might be friends, a spouse, your children, etc. then make use of them for the following questions: what are you wearing? (only needed if you're in so much doubt, you can't figure out what to choose.) which of my outfits do you think i look great in? , fix up any tears, loose hems, stains, etc. or get them to a dry cleaners. , if it is cold, wear warmer clothing, if it is hot, wear cooler clothing. if you really must wear something you'll freeze in, add a coat or jacket. do not wear anything you'll boil in, it is nigh on impossible to feel comfortable and you may faint or get heat stroke. , it might be fashionable, but does it fit and look great on you? if not, don't force yourself into it. instead, stick with whatever makes you look wonderful. gone are the days when only one style ruled the roost. you are liberated enough now to be able to choose what brings forth your best features. it's okay if it's not the textbook outfit to wear, it's more important that you feel confident with what you have on. you can give a nod to current trends by adding an accessory that sums up the trend, be it by color, shape or logo. , when everything is popping out or you can't distinguish your frame, the look fails to present you at your best. if something is really great and not in your size, get it tailored. a well-tailored outfit is always worth the effort and expense. , fashion doesn't always care about comfort but you should, especially if whatever you're going to requires you to stand a long time, or sit on hard seats, or be blown about by a cold breeze while pretending to like the weather. think about the venue too––heels on a lawn party will soon grow really exhausting, while running around in just a bikini at the pool party will be less desirable when it comes time to evening drinks indoors at the bar. , these are especially useful when you are not sure what the day holds; a cute knee length skirt, layered tanks, and a light jacket will go almost anywhere. peel or add layers to add or subtract formality. at nighttime, add some eye liner, high heels, maybe an over sized accessory and you'll get a whole new nighttime look. , tons of accessories aren't necessary. stick to your main piece and build around it with things that complement it. remember texture, prints, and colors. contrast is nice, but when everything clashes, it's going to spoil your whole presentation. a scarf is cute, whether it is a silk hermès", "consider your skin tone when making your selection.choose gold or platinum if your main concern is durability and you’re willing to pay for fine jewelry. opt for silver if you want your locket to withstand wear and tear without paying the price for gold. alternative metals that are popular include cobalt, tungsten carbide, ceramic, stainless steel and titanium.if you have cool skin tones, your ideal metals are light or white. for example, platinum, white gold and silver. if you have warm skin tones, you’ll look best in yellow gold, rose gold, copper or brass. people with neutral skin tones can wear any shade of metal.; , if you have a cool skin tone, look for gemstones in cool tones like red, blue and purple. if you have a warm skin tone, try yellow, green or orange gemstones. you may want to wear your birthstone or the birthstones of loved

are round, heart-shaped, oval and square. choose a heart-shaped locket for a romantic vibe, or to give to a partner as a gift.a round or oval locket is versatile and makes a good gift for someone who is not your romantic partner.for example, you may want to give a heart-shaped locket as a gift for an anniversary or valentine’s day. , get a locket in a standard shape with minimal ornamentation for a piece to wear with many outfits. alternately, go for a unique locket to wear as a statement piece. a simple locket is often round or oval, and may be plain on the face or have a lightly discernible etched pattern. look for lockets in unique shapes like an oyster, or with an interesting detail – for example, a butterfly perched on a heart locket., choose a chain that allows the locket to sit at your collarbone, by your heart, or just below your bustline. alternately, choose a long slide chain if you want the locket to sit near your naval. opt for thin chains if your locket is dainty and formal. wear a thin or chunky chain for a casual vibe.wrap or double-wrap a slider chain to change the length of your necklace.try different chains with the same locket for different ways to wear the same pendant., choose an image to display in your locket. press a piece of tracing paper into the recess of your locket. trace around it with a pencil to get the shape you’ll need to cut your photo down to.use an image of one of your loved ones to fit into your locket. for example, you may want to frame a small photo of a family member, spouse or pet in your locket. other options are an image of a religious icon, or a victorian picture for a vintage feel.if you’re printing out an image, opt for a grayscale print on regular paper. photo paper absorbs less ink and can fade more easily. ,

when he is of age and cleared for breeding.depending on your dog’s breed, he may not be able to mate successfully after the age of seven years old. you may need to speak to your vet to confirm your dog is healthy enough to breed if he is over seven years old.; , some male dogs may experience infertility or difficulties with breeding because they are too young or too old for breeding, they have a low sperm count, or they have a disease or disorder. you should confirm your dog is fertile and able to mate with a female dog before you proceed with the breeding process. your vet can do a physical exam of your dog’s genital area and run tests to confirm your dog is fertile.your vet will exam your dog’s reproductive anatomy and his prostate. they will also collect semen from your dog to be examined. if your dog is older, the vet may also require a sperm sample for testing. your vet may also ask you about your dog’s history of breeding. for example, they may ask, “has your dog mated successfully with a female before?” “how many litters has your dog sired?” “what issues does your dog seem to have during mating?” , once your vet has run tests and examined your dog, they should tell you if your dog is fertile or infertile. if your dog is having fertility problems and he is young in age, your vet may tell you to wait one year and then have him retested to see if his fertility improves with age.if your dog has a thyroid issue that results in a low spear count, your vet may recommend thyroid replacement or a hormone replacement. if your dog has prostate issues, such as an infection, your vet may recommend antibiotics and hormone therapy. , before you breed your male dog, you should confirm he is in good health. ask your vet to do a complete physical exam on your dog to check for health issues like hip dysplasia and joint problems. you want to be sure your dog does not have these health issues as you do not want them passed on to his litter when he does breed with a female dog.your vet should also check his ears and his eyes to ensure they are in good working condition. you should have your vet run a blood test and a urinalysis to check for any diseases or disorders, such as bone disease. , you should also have tests done to confirm your dog’s genetic make up, especially if your dog is not a pure breed. having clear information on your dog’s genetics can help you match him with a mating partner and get a good idea of the genetic makeup of any puppies he sires. you can", "reacting strongly can increase the cat's stress and interest in attacking you. it may even make the cat's prey instinct kick in more, spurring it on to bite down harder.instead, stop moving and reacting to the cat. this will take away all the fun the cat gets from the attack. if you don't \"play\" with the cat any further, it will likely lose interest and release its claws or teeth.; , if the cat has its claws or teeth in you, then you need to work on getting the cat to remove them. instead of pulling away, try push toward the cat further. this will hopefully confuse the cat, prompting it to let go.pressing towards the cat will get the cat to release because prey don't usually move toward the cat after an attack. , hitting or smacking the cat will only increase the stress and aggression it is feeling. while physical resistance may be your first response when being attacked, resist that urge.you can, however, use a strong and stern voice to admonish the attacking cat. this will show the cat your displeasure while not increasing its attacking instinct. , making a loud noise can shock the cat into releasing its grip if it is unwilling to give up on its attack. try making a loud noise or throw something across your room that will make a loud noise when it hits the floor.you can try to shock the cat by simply clapping very loudly. , if all else fails, you may need to restrain the cat. this can usually be done most easily during an attack by scruffing the cat. holding the cat by the scruff will disable the cat and allow you to get control of it. scruffing a cat needs to be done with caution. holding the cat by the loose skin at the back of the neck in the right way is not painful, but doing it wrong can injure the cat.ask your veterinarian how to scruff a cat and try it on a cat that is docile. this will assure that you know how to do it before you have to do it to a cat that is out of control. , once you have gotten the attacking cat off of you, walk away from it. do not interact with the cat at all and just move away from it. this will help to diffuse the situation. an aggressive cat is likely to continue its behavior if it gets a reaction or interaction due to the attack. this is especially helpful in dealing with a kitten that is playing too aggressively. withdrawing your attention if the cat plays too roughly will show it that the fun stops when they play too hard., do not keep an aggressive cat in a room if it doesn't want to stay. allow it to leave if it wants to so that it can go off on its own and cool down. for example, cats may act aggressively if they are scared, so letting it flee instead of keeping

book falls into the public domain and anyone can publish it. as a general rule, anything published in the united states before 1923 is in the public domain.however, keep in mind that later editions of a book that is in the public domain may not themselves be in the public domain. for example, although shakespeare is clearly in the public domain, if you want the digital rights for an illustrated edition of romeo and juliet published in 1995, that edition is not in the public domain.if a work was created between 1923 and 1978, the author or copyright holder was required to renew copyright protection after 28 years. many works created during that time have fallen into the public domain because the copyright was not renewed, but it will take some research to find out if that's the case.a 1992 federal law made renewal automatic for works published between 1964 and 1978, so those works along with works created from january 1, 1978 to the present typically will be covered by copyright.in the united states, books have copyright protection for the life of the author plus 70 years.if the book was written outside the united states, you must find out in which countries (if any) the book was published, and research the copyright laws of those countries to determine whether you can publish it in the u.s. and who you would need to contact to secure permission. note that copyright protection was triggered by publishing for earlier works, while later works (those created on or after january 1, 1978) have copyright protection from the moment they are created.older works that remained unpublished, such as personal diaries, are treated the same as works created after 1978. this means that if the author of the work died 70 years ago, the work is now in the public domain.you can start your search by looking at the copyright notice of the book, if it has one. the date on the copyright notice typically is the date the work was published.; , since copyright protection begins the moment a work is created, if the book is unpublished in any form the copyright may not be registered. registration is not a requirement for copyright protection of books created on or after january 1, 1978.you can search records created from 1978 to the present on the copyright office's website. the search includes copyright registration as well as any other recorded documents such as licenses or transfers of copyright ownership.the online system gives you the option of searching by title, name, or registration or document number. you also can do a keyword search. you should only do a title search if you know the exact title – otherwise, do a keyword search.you also have the option of limiting your search in various ways, such as by the year of registration or by the type of item registered.since you're looking", "if your garden patch or potted plant constantly has a pool of water sitting on top, then the soil is poorly draining. this is bad, because the buildup of water can cause the roots of the plant to rot, killing the plant over time. to remedy this, carefully dig out the plant and a clump of the surrounding soil; place the plant on a tarp or in another clean pot. mix compost or peat into the soil. replace your plant in its original location. if all of your soil is poorly draining, you can dig it up and mix in sand to help increase the drainage. , if you got a bit over-enthusiastic and planted several plants near each other when they were small, you may have been surprised when they grew up and began competing for space in your garden or indoor pot. plants that are put too close together will not grow as large, since there are not enough nutrients to be shared between them. simply dig up the offending plants, and relocate them to a new garden plot or pot that has more room. fill in the empty space with fresh gardening soil.always use store-bought gardening soil rather than soil from your yard, as the soil from your yard contains insects, plant diseases, and weeds that will spread to your plant in its new location. you can tell that plants are too close if they are growing into each other, or if their primary stems/branches become tangled. , while mulching is beneficial for adding nutrients and blocking out weeds, adding too much mulch can be problematic for a garden. this is because the mulch will not only block out weeds, but will also prevent new growth from your plants from breaking the surface. never add more than a 2-inch thick layer of mulch to your garden. if your garden isn’t growing after you’ve mulched, take off 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of mulch and wait a few weeks for improvement. if you add mulch too high on the base of a stem or tree, it will cut off valuable sunlight and prevent growth. move mulch off the base of the stems and tree trunks in your garden. , plant disease can spread quickly through a garden, if not contained. the same is true for a plant that is injured; if you don’t remove the dying limbs, it can continue to spread to the rest of the plant. whenever you notice plants that are yellow, browning, dry, brittle, or otherwise sickly looking, use a pair of gardening shears to cut off the branches from the base. throw these branches away rather than leaving them in your garden as compost, because if they do contain a plant disease, it can still spread to nearby plants. , although you may think you’re watering your plants correctly, if they begin to turn yellow and droop, you’re probably giving them too much water. most plant’s don’t need to be watered daily, in fact they do better when given a lot of water every few days.", "while it's not always possible to completely avoid a co-worker, you can strive to keep interactions as infrequent as possible. simply avoiding interaction is probably the easiest way to cope. some interactions are probably unavoidable, especially if you two work together directly. however, you can avoid chatting with this co-worker in the break room or during downtime. if you notice your co-worker come in, politely excuse yourself by saying something like, \"well, got to get back to work. nice seeing you.\"when you do have to interact with the co-worker, keep things professional. avoid bringing up personal matters or things irrelevant to the task at hand as, when dealing with someone who dislikes you, this is an invitation for negative interaction.; , many psychological studies indicate that it's very difficult to dislike someone who likes you. if your co-worker feels you respect and like him or her, some of the dislike he or she may have towards you might fade.tell someone else in the office that you like and respect the problem co-worker. that information may get repeated secondhand. when such a message does not come directly from you, your co-worker may be more likely to believe it.show a genuine interest in your co-worker's input. people tend to like people who pay attention and engage with them. while you should still stick to avoiding this person when possible, during the times you do have to interact listen to what he or she says actively. this might make your co-worker's dislike you less.small, friendly interactions can help as well. something as simple as \"good morning\" can go a long way., if you have trouble interacting with a particular colleague, try to separate your work life from your personal life. you do not have to socialize with colleagues outside of work. if the co-worker who dislikes you is frequently part of friday night happy hours, forego these events and seeing the friends you know from outside work., you do not want to report behavior unnecessarily. however, you should certainly report any behavior that's interfering with your ability to do your job. talk to human resources if the situation gets out of hand. management can help negotiate situations if your ability to do your job is threatened. you should keep a record of your interactions for a week or so if you plan to report just so you have solid information to show to officials.make sure you focus on how your co-worker's behavior affects the company. speak in objective terms and explain about how productivity and morale are damaged by your co-worker's attitude.remember, this is a last resort. you do not want to get labeled the office tattletale. you should only report your co-worker if you feel he or she is harassing you, attacking you personally, and is persistent in his or her actions despite your attempts to avoid or rectify the situation., emotionally, keeping a healthy perspective is one of the best ways to cope with a negative co-worker. stay focused on your larger dreams and career goals. avoid getting caught up in petty workplace", "there are three primary business bankruptcies you can choose. not all are available to all business owners. consider the following: chapter 7. this is a “liquidation,” which means the bankruptcy trustee sells your assets and you shut down the business. unlike a personal chapter 7, there is no “means test” if most of your debts are business related, and you don’t receive a discharge of debts at the end of the bankruptcy.all business types can choose a chapter 7. if you are a sole proprietor, however, you can get a discharge because there is no legal distinction between you as a person and your sole proprietorship. chapter 11. you can reorganize your business debts and keep your business open with a chapter 11. you must come up with a repayment plan, which your creditors will vote on. they can either approve the plan or reject it. even if your creditors reject it, the judge can still approve the plan if it is fair. chapter 11 is often used by very large publicly-traded companies, but it is available for all business types. chapter 13. this bankruptcy is generally only available for sole proprietorships.you can reorganize the business debts and adopt a payment plan that lasts three to five years. the trustee doesn’t sell your assets, and at the end of payment period your unsecured debts are wiped. in many ways, it is like a chapter 11. , go through your financial records and decide whether you think you can make the business profitable. try to identify why you didn’t succeed initially. if you think your business faced temporary problems, then you might want to continue it by filing a chapter 11 bankruptcy. if you are a sole proprietor, you also have the option of filing a chapter 13. you might also be able to continue a sole proprietorship by filing chapter 7 if you can shield your business assets using exemptions. for example, your state might have a “wildcard” exemption you can apply to any assets you own.this will keep the trustee from selling them. , a chapter 13 limits the amount of debt you can have. if you have more than the maximum, you’ll need to choose a different bankruptcy option for your business (such as chapter 11). your secured debt cannot exceed $1,184,200. your unsecured debt cannot exceed $394,725. , many businesses are legally distinct from their owners. for example, the owners of corporations and llcs are typically not personally responsible for business debts. however, exceptions exist: you might have personally guaranteed a loan. for example, a bank might not have lent your llc money unless you agreed to be personally responsible for the debt. if you are the owner of a partnership or sole proprietorship, then you are personally liable for business debts unless you were in a limited liability partnership.if you are personally liable on business debts, you should consider filing a personal bankruptcy at the same time as a business bankruptcy. for example, a partnership could file a chapter 7 and individual partners could file under chapter 13", "installing a traditional tile backsplash in your kitchen requires several different items. make sure you are fully prepared before starting your project. the materials you need to have prepared before you begin include your tile, tile adhesive, and grout. make sure you have the necessary tools, including a notched trowel, tape measure, sponge, level, utility knife, and a tile cutter. you may need spacers for tiles that are not attached together in sections. you may want to use something to cover your countertops during this process to keep them clean.; , in order for the tile adhesive to stick the walls, they must be free of any dust or grease. wipe them down with a damp rag, and give enough time for them to completely dry. , it is important to make sure you get a good measurement so you know exactly what size you should cut your tiles. choose a stopping point, either directly below your cabinets or at an arbitrary point on the wall. make sure that you have enough tiles to fill the measured space, as well as a few extras for precaution. use a level and straight edge to mark your stopping point along the wall. , use your trowel to smooth the tile adhesive across the wall, working in small sections. if you apply too much at once, it will begin to dry before you get a chance to attach the tiles. always start applying your tiles from the bottom center, and working outwards from there. don’t apply the tile adhesive to the backs of the tiles, as it will be more difficult to attach them to the wall. , press them into the tile adhesive on the wall, using a level to make sure they are even. push them a few times to make sure they are secured to the wall. if your tiles are not attached together in sections, use spacers to make sure they are all evenly spaced. wiggle the tile a little bit against the wall to ensure suction with the adhesive., attach all remaining tiles to your wall using this method, until you reach the edges. before you stick your tiles to the edges of the wall, cut off any excess or oddly shaped corners to make sure the fit is perfect. always cut out holes for outlets or odd edges prior to attaching the tile to the wall. any empty spaces can be filled with pieces of spare tile you cut to size with your tile cutter or utility knife. , use your (cleaned) trowel to spread grout evenly across the tiles. don’t worry about covering the tiles, as that is what is supposed to happen. you will remove the unnecessary grout later. spread the grout at a 45 degree angle in a sweeping pattern. allow a few minutes for the grout to set, and then use a damp sponge to clean off excess grout. all of the cracks between the tiles should be filled, while the remaining tiles should be cleaned of all unnecessary grout. , after the grout has", "by educating yourself about the condition and the challenges it may pose to your partner, you will have a better understanding of what he is dealing with on a daily basis. this knowledge may help you to be more patient, learn better ways to communicate with him, and even improve your relationship. read general definitions of autism. focus on books and articles written by autistic people, since they have firsthand experience on what it is like to live as an autistic person. be careful of your sources; some autism groups that claim to speak for autistic people actually work hard to silence them.; , autistic people often struggle to communicate in the same ways that non-autistic people do. some forms of expression may be too nuanced and difficult for them to understand and respond to. this may lead to misunderstandings and problems within a relationship. to avoid these problems, try to be as direct as possible when you speak to your boyfriend.for example, imagine you say something like, “gina texted me earlier today.” you may expect him to ask you, “about what?” but your boyfriend might not understand that you are trying to have a conversation since you are not asking him a question. instead, it might be better to ask him, “do you want to know what gina said when she texted me today?” or just tell him what she said. every autistic person is different. expect to learn and adjust over time as you get to know more about your boyfriend. , social situations that are fun or easy for you might be stressful and difficult for your boyfriend. the loudness and crowding of some social situations might cause your boyfriend to feel anxious and have a hard time concentrating on what people are saying. your boyfriend might also have a hard time making introductions or small talk.try writing a letter to your boyfriend about what his role is in social gatherings. use direct language and only discuss one issue at a time. for example, you might write a letter focusing on why you want him to attend parties with you. work together on making social situations more comfortable for him. perhaps he'd be able to handle parties if he could slip away to take a break every half hour or so, or if you set a time at which you'd leave early so he'd know he wouldn't have to handle it for much longer. , some autistic people do not like to be touched or know when it is appropriate to give physical affection. therefore, your boyfriend may not know when you want him to hug you or he may not like it when you touch him without warning. discuss these things with him to make it easier for you to have a better physical connection. for example, after something upsetting has happened, you could say to your boyfriend, “i'm feeling really upset right now. could you please give me a hug? it would help me to feel better.”, some autistic people may have certain routines that help them", "when was the last time you gave your husband or wife a sweet, surprising gift? maybe you both have everything you need, but it's nice to get a thoughtful gift every once in a while. it doesn't have to be expensive; just a little something to show your spouse you've been thinking of him or her and you're thankful to be married. here are a few ideas for thoughtful gifts: cook your spouse's favorite dinner, and serve it with a nice bottle of wine. buy your spouse something you've seen him or her eyeing online for awhile, or something he or she admired in a shop window. flowers and chocolate are classic thoughtful gifts that everyone can appreciate. surprise your spouse by doing his or her regular chores sometime. clean up the bedroom, buy a few new throw pillows, and light some candles one evening when you're both staying in. plant your spouse's favorite flowers in front of the house. throw a dinner party and invite your spouse's family and friends. , are you taking your spouse for granted in any way? do you know what worries he or she has, or what needs aren't always being met? go out of your way to ease your spouse's mind and make life a little easier for him or her. try to get more in tune with how you can be a better husband or wife. this will strengthen your marriage and help it feel more satisfying. divide the household chores evenly. don't be lazy and let your spouse do all the work. are you doing your fair share? take care of your spouse when he or she is sick or tired. help him or her feel better in any way you can. spend time discussing your spouse's worries. is there any way you can help to solve the problems? you'll feel closer to one another if you can find a solution together. , a few compliments can go a long way toward spicing up a marriage. just make sure they're genuine! what do you truly appreciate about your spouse? do you ever make a point of telling him or her? now's the time to start expressing your appreciation and letting your spouse know you think he or she is the most wonderful person in the world. the number of compliments and positive things you say to your spouse should greatly exceed the number of negative things you say. you don't have the right to cut your spouse down, and you should never insult him or her. be accepting, and if it's necessary to say something negative, be gentle. compliment your spouse in front of other people. your spouse will feel great, and others will be impressed at how happy and sweet your marriage is. never, ever criticize your spouse in front of other people; this can cause long-term damage. , tallying up how many times you took the kids to school this week, made dinner, did the dishes, and so on is a recipe for resentment. you and your spouse aren't opponents -", "contact the administrative office of your local government or check out your local government website. you might need to petition on a county or state level. have the office direct you to the department that handles matters related to your cause. then request petition guidelines. , this is very important. it would be horrible to set a goal of 1,000 signatures, reach it, and then realize you need 2,000. also look up whether or not your petition needs approval before being circulated. , if you are trying to get a candidate's name added to the ballot, and the law says you must show an address for each name, ask your signers for this information. , researching your topic is also a good way to find out if someone has already started a petition about it. , regardless of your choice, you will still need to write the petition properly. (see below for more advice on this.) paper petitions can be more effective for local petitions, but online petitions can reach broader networks much faster. consider sites like ipetitions.com, petitions24.com, or gopetition.com, which offer a higher level of accountability than some competing petition sites. facebook causes can also be a great, accountable way to collect a large amount of online support for an issue. the details matter just as much for online petitions as for paper ones. if your cause requires people to take action and not just agree to a position, consider collective action alternatives to petitions. for example, you could start a campaign on an online forum like the point. online forums and similar sites gather support in the same way a petition does, but they are centered around eventually taking an action to force a change---not just passively asking for it. , it should be precise, concise, and informative. weak: we support more funding for a park. this sentence is far too general. what kind of park? how much funding? strong: we demand that the commissioners of nature county allocate funds for a new park in the adventure district. the precise details are clearly written in this sentence. , people will be less likely to support you if they have to spend a great deal of time reading what you have to say. no matter how long your petition is, you must put your specific goal at the very beginning of the first paragraph. then follow it up with your reason(s) for petitioning. this will be the paragraph that most people read. example of the first paragraph of a petition: we demand that the commissioners of nature county allocate funds for a new park in the adventure district. this district does not have any parks. our children need to have a place where they can experience nature and play outdoors. , these paragraphs should contain information and specific examples showing the importance of what you are fighting for. write as many body paragraphs as you like, but just be aware that most people you speak with on the street will not read all of them. , make sure it (1)", "if you have punished your dog more than three times for the same behavior, your punishment is not appropriate. remember - the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results! punishing your dog will damage your relationship with your dog and possibly make the problem worse. a punishment does not have to be physical. find alternatives that don’t injure or scare your dog. do not hit or hurt your dog in any way. this breeds vicious, scared dogs, not lovable, huggable pooches. never hit your dog. just say \"no!\" firmly instead.your dog will make the connection between his behavior and what you did to stop him., if there are certain objects, toys, and plants in your house or garden that appear to \"set off\" your dog, remove them. give your dog a toy that it likes, that it will spend an hour playing with. get a rawhide bone, a real bone, or a safe chew-toy. if there is some way to fill it with treats, your dog will spend even more time trying to get the treats out., clicker training is a method of delivering immediate praise with the help of a clicker. you can click faster than you can give a treat or pet your dog's head. as such, clicker training reinforces good behavior fast enough for a dog's learning speed. it works by creating a positive association between the click sound and rewards. eventually, your dog will consider the sound of the clicker itself reward enough for good behavior. you can apply the principle of clicker training to any dog command.click the clicker device, then immediately give the dog a treat. this creates a positive association with the click sound. later, that sound will “mark” a behavior as correct so the dog knows that he did something right.when the dog performs a desired behavior, make the click sound, then give him a treat. once he's performing that behavior consistently, you can give the behavior a command name. begin tying the command and the behavior together with the help of the clicker. for example, before you ever teach your dog the \"sit\" command, give the click sound, a treat, and praise when you find him sitting. when he begins sitting just to get the treats, start saying the word \"sit\" to get him into position. pair it with the click sound to reward him. eventually, he will learn that sitting in response to the \"sit\" command will earn him a click reward., when your dog does a behavior you do want, such as laying down instead of barking, reward him or her. he will be much more likely to repeat the desired behavior and less likely to repeat the \"bad\" behavior. when incentives for bad behavior are withdrawn and incentives for good behavior are introduced consistently, the dog will soon learn the preferred response., try to stop yelling, cajoling, or responding in any manner that gives the dog signals that you are excited, playful, dog-focused. whilst you may feel very irritated, even angry, the", "if there are four or more players, shuffle two decks together.if there are eight or more players, shuffle three decks together.if you want to use a variant rule, make sure everyone agrees before the game begins. once the cards have been dealt, the rules cannot be changed.; , someone can volunteer to be dealer or you can select one randomly. don't look at the cards you've been dealt! if anyone does, shuffle the cards again and re-deal. if you play multiple rounds, take turns as the dealer, going clockwise. the dealer should give himself the same number of cards. , place the remainder of the deck in a face down stack to from the draw pile. flip over the top card face up next to it to form the discard pile. , don't look at the cards or turn them face up yet. , you can choose the second one after you've turned over your first. , use the scoring guide for a common system, or use a variation. write or print it out for people who haven't played before. points are bad! make sure everyone knows the goal of the game is to get the lowest score, not the highest! , if possible this should be someone who has played the game before, so the new players can learn by watching them. after that player is finished, play continues clockwise, each player taking a turn in order. , you can take the top card of the discard pile if you think it will be useful. otherwise, draw a card from the top of the draw pile (the rest of the deck). read the rest of these rules or see strategy to help you make this decision. , you can replace any card, whether it's face up or face down. pick up the card you want to replace from your grid and put it face up in the discard pile. place the newly drawn card face up in its place. you cannot shift the position of your grid around before you do this. if you don't like the card you just drew, you can discard it face up in the discard pile instead of replacing a card in your grid. you cannot do this if the card you drew just came from the discard pile. , if the two cards in a column share the same number or letter (for instance, a queen above another queen), they cancel each other out and are worth nothing (zero points). remember, you're trying to get the lowest score possible! if you like, you can take columns that have canceled out and place them on the bottom of the discard pile (not the top). this makes the table less cluttered. , once someone replaces their last face down card, each other player turns their grid face up as well and takes one final turn in clockwise order. , wait until the last player takes their turn, then flip every card in front of you face up. use a sheet of paper with each player's name on", "after ducklings have hatched from their shells and spent about 24 hours getting used to their new surroundings, they're ready to move to a brooder.a plastic storage container, sturdy cardboard box, or large glass aquarium can all work for this purpose. the box should be well-insulated, since the ducklings need to stay warm. don't choose a box with too many holes in the sides or the bottom. line the bottom of the box with wood shavings or old towels. avoid using newspaper or other slippery material. ducklings are still wobbly on their legs for the first few weeks after they hatch, and they can slip easily and hurt themselves on surfaces like plastic or newspaper.; , baby ducks need to be kept very warm in the first few weeks after they hatch, to give them the chance to get used to the chilly air outside their eggs. buy a brooding lamp at a feed store or hardware store and affix it to the top of the brooder. use a 100-watt bulb to start. for very young ducklings, this should create the right amount of heat. make sure part of the brooder is located away from the heat, so they have a place to cool off if they need to. make sure the bulb isn't too close to the ducklings. this may cause them to overheat, or if they touch the bulb, they could get burned. if you're using a shallow brooder, prop the lamp up higher using blocks of wood or another sturdy prop , periodically check the lamp’s placement, ensuring that the ducklings are getting an appropriate amount of warmth. the heat and wattage of the lamp should be altered based on your ducklings' behavior as they get older. if the ducklings tend to huddle close together under the lamp, they may be too cold and you should move the lamp closer or get a higher wattage bulb. if the ducklings are scattered out and breathing heavily, they're most likely getting overheated, and you need to move the lamp further away or use a lower wattage bulb. comfortable ducklings should be warm and settled. , as the ducks grow older, they will need less heat. raise the lamp or change the bulb to a lower heat when they stop sleeping under it. , put a shallow drinking bowl inside the brooder that is deep enough for the ducklings to dip in their beaks, but not their entire heads.ducklings like to be able to clear their nostrils as they drink, but if you give them access to deeper water they could climb in and drown.change the water and clean the bowl every day to make sure the ducklings don't get sick from drinking dirty water. if you fear the bowl you have is a little too deep for your ducklings to drink from safely, lining the bottom with pebbles or marbles will make it safer for them., ducklings don't eat for the first twenty-four hours after they hatch, since they're still absorbing nutrients from the yolk inside the egg they hatched from.", "it is a metal tool that is used to secure the rubber band around the scrotum.; , don’t use household office supplies for banding. the bands should be thick enough and tight enough to lead to castration within a few weeks. store your castration bands in the refrigerator until they are ready for use. this will keep the rubber from breaking down. always check the rubber ring for elasticity/ breakage before applying it, simply put it on the tool and squeeze the handles to stretch the rubber ring. it should not break/ rip and be free of any cracks. , you will need some antiseptic spray in case of infection. take your goat kid to the veterinarian at the first sign of an infection. , they reach sexual maturity at this time and can begin impregnating your doe (female goats). an uncastrated male goat is called a “buck.” make sure both testes have descended before you band your goat. you can have short-scrotum goats if a testis is pushed into the belly cavity. , banding is painful to the goat, so administering anti-inflammatories can reduce discomfort. to reduce pain further, you can administer lidocaine to numb the area during the banding period.,,, set the kid in your helpers lap, so that his belly is up and his front hooves are restrained. , squeeze the elastrator handles to expand the band. , move the handle of the elastrator closer to the base of the scrotum. , if you are right handed, put the tool aside for a minute, with your left hand hold the scrotum and feel if both testicles are inside. if not, don't let go, still holding with your left hand, reach with your right hand to the goats belly close to the scrotum, they tend to hold the testicles in sometimes, find them under the skin and push towards the scrotum \"catching\" them with your left hand. once you can feel both testicles inside you can put the rubber ring on. still holding the testicles with your left hand, squeeze the tools handles, pushing scrotum through the open rubber ring, carefully place it where you want it to be, close slightly so that they don't escape again, and with left hands fingers help push down the rubber ring from the first two metal ring expanders and then remove it completely. check for proper placement again. leave them loose, putting the ring a bit closer to the body. otherwise it will be very painful for the animal and you will have to redo it. also, make sure that the nipples are outside of the band., keep it sterilized to avoid infection. , don’t wait until the constriction starts to take place. if a nipple is inside the rubber band or a testis is pushed up, you should replace the band correctly. , spray with antiseptic if the area looks too inflamed. administer pain relief beforehand, since this will be painful for the goat. , the scrotum will start to shrivel. if the scrotum is hanging off by a thin thread of", "this nearly ancient formula is still the easiest way to determine the surface area of a sphere. using almost any calculator, you can plug in the radius to get the surface area of your sphere. r, or \"radius: the radius is the distance from the center of the sphere to the edge of that sphere. π, or \"pi:\" this incredible number (equalling roughly 3.14) represents the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter, and is useful in all equations with circles and spheres. it is commonly shortened as π = 3.1416, but there are an infinite number of decimals.4: for somewhat complex reasons, the surface area of a sphere is always 4 times as large as the area of a circle with the same radius.; , sometimes your problem will supply you the radius, and other times you will have to find it yourself. if you are given the diameter of a circle, simply divide the diameter by 2 to get the radius. for example, a sphere of diameter 10 inches has a radius of 5 inches. advanced tip:if you only know the volume of a sphere, you need to do a little more work to get the radius. divide the volume by 4π, then multiply that answer by 3. finally, take the cube root of this answer. , you can either do this by manually multiplying (52 = 5 * 5 = 25) or by using your calculator's \"square\" function (sometimes labeled as \"x2\"). , while you can multiply either 4 or pi first, it is generally easier to start with 4 since there are no decimals to multiply yet. if our radius is 5, like above, you would be left with 4 * 25 * π, or 100π. , if your problem says \"exact value\", write the symbol π after your number and call it done. otherwise, use the approximation π=3.14 or your calculator's π button. 100 * π = 100 * 3.14 100π = 314 , is your sphere's surface area 314 inches big, or 314 miles big? the units need to be written as \"units2,\" because this denotes area, otherwise known as \"square units\" the full answer to the sphere in the pictures is: surface area = 314 units2. the units you use are always the same ones used to measure the radius. if the radius is in meters, the answer will be in meters. advanced tip: we square the units because area measures how many flat squares we could fit on the surface of the sphere. say we measure the practice problem in inches. this means on a sphere where r=5, we could fit 314 squares on the surface of the sphere if the sides of every square are 1 inch long. , if the radius of a sphere is 7 centimeters, what is the surface area of that sphere? 4πr2 r = 7 4 * π * 72 49 * 4 * π 196π answer: surface area = 615.75 centimeters2, or 615.75 square centimeters. , the surface area of a sphere is the area

performers, fortune tellers, and free spirited vagabonds will likely do well for your boho styles outfit., naturalness is one of the major tenets of the boho style, which was greatly influenced by the hippy mentality that environmentally friendly clothing is preferred to synthetic fibers.this ideal is reflected in the bohemian style through the use of fabrics such as: cotton cheesecloth linen silk hemp , another influence of the hippy movement on boho style is its emphasis on freedom and openness.in boho style, this is represented by light and airy fabrics, like dusters, light weave scarves, and silk shawls., in line with the environmentally friendly ideology, boho makes use of many earth tones, like deep browns, tans, and autumnal reds.think about offsetting these dependable earthy colors with light colored neutral shades, like taupe and cream., one of the most notable features of boho style is its use of various patters in less traditional combinations, layered in a way that expresses and highlights your character. rather than drawing attention to a particular article of clothing, as you might normally, try to mesh the patterns you choose.for example, you might make an outfit: floral themed polka dotted subtly pinstriped gingham themed , when coordinating so many different styles and patterns, balance can be difficult. try to keep any one part of your outfit from being too busy pattern-wise than the rest of it. in boho styles, the eye should be naturally drawn to the face as the central feature of the outfit., many secondhand stores have a surplus of clothing from this period, and here you might find out peasant blouses and maxi skirts that you can use in your bohemian style.the heavy influence of hippy style on clothing from this time period makes it ideal for boho fashion. you might also visit garage/yard sales and estate auctions to find these articles of clothing. modern versions of these creations can sometimes be found in specialty shops. , the origins of the bohemian people, the roma, are theorized to be on the indian subcontinent.over the course of the roma people's migration to central europe, many bold patterns and styles, like those you might see worn in parts of africa or india, were adopted. pair these patterns with different patterns without giving too much weight to clash. if outfit cohesion is important to you, you might choose a theme, like floral patterns or simple geometric designs, like polka dots and stripes. be sure you give contrasting colors and patterns a try. you never know when two seemingly opposing patterns will bring out the bohemian in you! , too many dangling ends or busy patterns at the bottom of your outfit might draw attention away from your face; the bohemian style begins at the face and

walk your dog, watch for obstacles that may cause your dog to trip and gently redirect your dog as needed. using a back or front clip harness rather than a leash may give you a little more control over your dog and make it easier for you to guide him around obstacles.also, keep in mind that your dog will need reassurance if something noisy startles him. pay attention to your surroundings and talk to your dog to let him know everything is okay. when you are out walking with your dog, do not let your blind dog get near strange dogs or people, especially children. blind dogs may nip in defense if they become startled.; , to train a dog to respond to verbal cues, you need to be consistent and always offer a reward when your dog responds to the cue. for example, to teach your dog to sit with the “sit” command, you would need to practice telling your dog to sit a few times every day. after each time that your dog responds to the cue by sitting, you would give your dog a treat and some praise.make sure that you offer the treat and praise right away. for example, you would need to give your dog his treat right after your dog’s bottom hits the floor so that he will make the connection that this is a good thing to do. keep training sessions short to help your dog stay focused. dogs have short attention spans, so it is best to keep training sessions under 10 minutes. end on a positive note. if your dog starts to get impatient, give him a command that he has already mastered, such as “sit,” then reward him with a treat and some praise and end the session. , your dog can still feel and he will likely use his sense of touch to figure out how to get around the house.you can use your dog's sense of touch to help train him as well.. to use touch in training sessions, you can do things like using the leash to steer your dog in the direction that you want him to go or applying gentle pressure to his body to get him to complete a command. for example, if you are teaching your dog the \"sit\" command, you might place one hand on his behind and apply gentle pressure to help him understand what you are asking him to do. , most dogs will see an upcoming corner while riding in a car and brace themselves so they don’t fall over. a blind dog cannot use that visual clue, so saying “corner” before a turn will help the dog associate the word with turning a corner. after repeating this cue several times, your dog will learn to brace himself. , a blind dog cannot see objects or obstacles that may cause him to fall or bump his head. to help your dog

it’s not impossible to use long-grain, it will not work as well as the shorter ones.; , use a colander style sieve with holes that are small enough that the rice won’t fall through. follow the instructions on the package of rice to measure out the amount you want to cook.if you use a rice cooker measuring cup, remember it is probably not a standard u.s. cup (237 ml). the package of rice and the rice cooker are likely to have different instructions for measuring the rice. since the rice cooker is designed specifically, follow its directions over the rice package. remember that rice expands as it cooks, so one uncooked cup of rice might be close to two cooked cups of rice. , grab a regular bowl, or basin of any kind, and set it under your faucet in the sink. as water strains through the rice and falls into the bowl, you’ll be able to gauge when the rice is completely rinsed. , turn the faucet on cold and begin to rinse the rice. this is necessary because packaged rice has lots of powdery starch in it. the rice needs to be washed completely so that it cooks up properly and doesn’t become too gooey.cold water works best so that the rice doesn’t start cooking while you wash it. if you want to conserve water, just fill the bowl and set the sieve down into it. the rice won’t get as clean this way, but it will still rinse off most of the powder. , use your hands to gently massage and stir the rice so that each grain gets rinsed completely. don’t press or squeeze the rice, as this will break the grains. as you rinse the rice, watch how the water in the bowl turns hazy from the powder.as you stir, look for any foreign objects that may have ended up in the rice. most rice won’t have an excessive amount of non-rice, but it’s always good to check. , when the water in the bowl is clear and not hazy, the rice is completely rinsed. turn the water off and empty the bowl of rinse water., set out a cookie sheet or some wax paper and pour the rice out on it. spread it around with your hand so it forms a single layer and is not piled up. leave the rice sitting to dry for about 15 minutes.if you are in a hurry, it’s not absolutely necessary to dry the rice, but it helps it cook better. , scoop the rice into a pile and begin transferring it from the drying surface into the rice cooker. be sure you haven’t measured out more rice than your rice cooker can handle

drapes well, chiffon adds elegance and shape to the otherwise boxy cut of the palazzo style. you may even have trouble if you want to find chiffon pants cut to any other form. chiffon is a material that doesn't have much structure on its own, so it is ill-suited for clothing meant to give shape and form to your body. wide-leg palazzo pants, on the other hand, have very little shape and can take full advantage of the breezy, easy-going sophistication of chiffon.; , as with any garment, you need to make sure that the pants fit you properly. the surest way to verify an accurate fit is to try the pants on and take a good look at your legs in a full length mirror. chiffon pants are sized like any other style of trouser, so start by selecting a pair in your usual size. if they fit correctly, the pants should fit snugly around your natural waist (the thinnest part of your mid-section) and drape down over the entire length of your leg, falling out around the ankle. the wide leg should not hug the curves of your leg too closely, so if you see any stretching down the length of the leg, that particular pair of pants might be too small. , before you buy a pair of chiffon pants or wear them around town, you should look at yourself in a full length mirror under bright light. since chiffon is so light, it also tends to be see-through. looking at yourself under a bright light will let you see how much can be viewed through the material. most clothing manufacturers take appropriate measures to allow you to show off your legs without showing off your unmentionables. chiffon pants usually have a second short, inner layer near the top that covers the hip and upper thigh area. nonetheless, the wrong pair of chiffon pants can still produce a visible panty line, so checking the appearance is a good idea. it's also best to wear white or nude colored undergarments beneath the chiffon pants since bright or dark colors can easily show through. , chiffon pants come in a wide range of colors and prints. when shopping for your first pair, you should think about where you plan to wear the pants and what you want them to say about your personal style. if you want to ease your way into the style, consider white or black chiffon pants. white pants can look both casual and dressy depending on what you wear them with, so they'll offer you the most versatility. black chiffon pants are a little more difficult to dress down, but they can create a look ranging between sexy and elegant. for the more adventurous fashionistas, consider a pair of chiffon pants in a bright color or a bold print. you can find chiffon palazzo pants in colors like fire engine red and patterns like leopard print., chiffon palazzo pants naturally elongate the appearance of your", "there are many blogs and

relationship with someone who actively wants to ruin it. , normally, random acts of kindness can provide a spontaneous \"spark\" for a relationship. however, if one partner has been having serious thoughts about someone else, this sort of kindness may simply make her guilty. almost no one likes receiving appreciation from someone they know they've wronged, so if your girlfriend seems unhappy to

interest in maintaining the property to support and increase business. this works in favor of the property owner since the property lessee is more likely to invest in creating a workable and attractive space. you may be able to enter into a triple net lease, whereby the lessee pays for property expenses and real estate taxes and the buyer is only required to pay the mortgage. large companies with many retail spaces are more likely to enter into these types of leases. typically, commercial leases are more flexible because they are not regulated as closely as residential leases

buyers should assess the following risks: a buyer must consider how much time they have to dedicate to the management of the property. the owner is responsible for managing each property, assessing

property becomes too burdensome, the buyer might need to retain expert help to manage all aspects of the purchase and maintenance of the property, which could require a significant financial outlay. you may be required to put forth a large down payment or put money into replacing a roof or repaving a parking lot., while some residential real estate investors will purchase, rehab and resell a

potatoes like yukon golds which aren't as starchy as the russet potatoes.; , fill the saucepan with enough cold water to completely cover the pieces of potato. turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. reduce the heat to low and let the potatoes bubble lightly. simmer the potatoes for about 15 minutes. they should be tender if you poke them with a fork.for extra flavor, you can add a few pinches of salt to the water that you boil the potatoes in. , wear oven mitts and drain the water out of the saucepan. place the potatoes back into the pan and turn the heat on medium. let the potatoes cook for about three minutes so they dry out a little. turn off the heat and use a potato masher to mash the potatoes in the pan. transfer the mashed potatoes to a mixing bowl.the mashed potatoes should be completely smooth since it may be difficult to fill the pierogi with lumpy mashed potatoes. , melt 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter or olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. once the pan is hot and the butter is melted, add 3 medium onions that are finely chopped. you should have about 3 3/4 cups of chopped onion. saute the onions for about 15 to 20 minutes. they should become caramelized and soft. divide the sauteed onions into two portions.set aside one portion to use as a garnish for the cooked pierogi. the other portion will be mixed into the filling mixture. , add one portion of the sauteed onions into the mixing bowl with the mashed potatoes. add 10 ounces (280 g) of crumbled farmer cheese along with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. stir the mixture so the filling is combined. set the mixture aside.the filling should be at room temperature before you use it to fill the pierogi dough. , place 7 cups (2 pounds or 875 g) of unbleached

and butter mixture. use your fingers to stir the mixture until it starts to form a dough. if the mixture is too dry to come together, stir in the remaining 1/4 of a cup (60 ml) of warm water one tablespoon at a time.the dough will look like a shaggy lump once it's ready to knead. , sprinkle a counter or work space", "we all love to have fun in the sun, but it is important to be careful. sun damage is responsible for many of the most common skin problems: wrinkles, dryness, and discoloration. of course, the greatest damage is from skin cancer, which is increasingly common. make sure to take proper precautions.make spf your friend. it's not enough to apply sunscreen before heading for a day at the beach. it should be part of your every day routine. look for moisturizers that contain at least 15 spf. it won't hurt to use make-up that contains spf, for added protection! dress appropriately. wear light loose clothing to protect your skin. also, wearing sunglasses is about more than fashion--they are very important in protecting your eyes from the sun! , literally ease up on your skin. a lot of damage to the facial skin is caused by physical pressure. this is the result of simple things such as holding your cell phone to tightly to your face and leaning your chin on your hand while thinking. the pressure can expose your skin to a lot of bacteria, which can result in breakouts and infections. so make sure to touch your face to other objects as little as possible., next to sun, stress might have the biggest negative impact on your skin. if you are feeling a lot of anxiety, the effects can wreak havoc on your face. there are many ways that stress can manifest itself on your skin, including rashes and increased breakouts. find a method or tricks to help you relaxed when you are feeling a lot of stress. your skin will thank you!, the surfaces that come into contact with your skin can be responsible for causing blemishes and irritation. pay careful attention to your laundry schedule--it is important to rest your face on clean pillow cases. also, make sure that your make-up brushes are clean. wash them regularly with warm water and a mild soap., food has a

breakouts", "oil, dirt, and dead skin can create an impossibly thick barricade for your hair follicles to break through. you can grow facial hair much faster if your face is consistently kept clean. wash your face with warm water and a gentle facial cleanser once in the morning and once in the evening. a gentle cleanser is recommended over standard soap, since standard soap can be too abrasive for the skin on your face and may cause irritation. you should also wash your face any time of the day that it gets notably dirty with sweat or oil. if an itchy rash develops as your facial hair grows in, try using a dandruff shampoo two to three times weekly to relieve the irritation.switch to an exfoliating facial cleanser once a week to strip away dead skin cells. after washing your face, use a moisturizing facial lotion to keep the skin hydrated and to prevent dead skin cells from gathering and clogging up your follicles.; , as such, one of the best things to do in order to keep your facial hair grow faster is simply to let it grow without disruption. hair growth increases faster immediately after you shave, but it decreases hair growth shortly thereafter. as such, any increase in hair growth that does result from shaving gets canceled out. note that your facial hair can get a bit unsightly as it initially grows out, so it is recommended that you start at a time during which you do not need to appear at work or any formal social events. , while this may seem a little unconventional, a light massage over your face can encourage the hair follicles there to grow in faster and thicker. apply gently yet even pressure along the areas of your face over which you want to stimulate hair growth. rub in small circular motions, and massage your face consistently for about 10 to 15 minutes twice daily. , simply put, stress thins out your hair, making it difficult to grow a beard, mustache, or goatee. reducing stress as much as possible can greatly increase the rate at which your facial hair grows.both mental and physical stress can cripple your immune system, thereby limiting your ability to grow facial hair. stress can be nearly impossible to eliminate completely, but you can take small steps to limit the amount of stress in your life. try meditation or exercise as a means of releasing anxiety or talk to others about effective ways of reducing stress. , proper rest is a key element in maintaining all of your body's functions, including hair growth. sleep is a period of time during which your body regenerates lost cells, and hair growth tends to increase during periods of sleep. if you sleep for less than six hours each night, growing facial hair quickly is all but impossible. for best results, sleep for at least eight hours nightly. , as with sleep, regular exercise is also a key element of maintaining bodily functions, including hair growth. focus on aerobic exercise, which improves blood circulation.", "the types of neurons in the human body include sensory as well as motor neurons. generally speaking, neurons are specialized cells of the nervous system of all living systems including mammalians. the two main neuronal types in humans are motor and sensory neurons. sensory neurons are one type of cells that is very important for the proper communication of the body with the environment. without these neurons the body would be considered in a state of partial death due to the lack of its ability to communicate with the surrounding environment.; , sensation is an important physiological process that is crucial for the sustaining of life of the living tissue. for example instinctual needs of humans such as the need to urinate and defecate are mediated through sensory neurons that are located in the urinary bladder and in the nervous system of the alimentary canal. these sensory neurons send electrical signals that are formed through action potentials to the brain where it is perceived by specialized neurons in the sensory area of the cerebral cortex. in turn motor neurons of the cerebral cortex also initiate the processes of defecation and urination by giving orders to the urinary bladder muscles and the muscles of the colon. these orders include the relaxation of the sphincters of the urinary bladder and the increased peristaltic motion of the colon wall. these two actions involve the muscles of these two structures. , the result is the expulsion of urine from the urinary bladder and the feces from the colon. these two processes are two basic but very important physiological processes that maintain the normal function of the body. neurological defects in these sensory or motor neurons can lead to problems in performing these two processes. this can have clinical manifestations such as the development of megacolon and the retention of urine in the body. retention of urine in the body can lead to the accumulation of waste chemicals in the body to toxic levels such as ammonia and creatinine. also high blood pressure and edema can develop as a result of this. these two basic processes are just one manifestation of the importance of sensory neurons in humans. also other instinctual needs of the body are very dependent on the intact structure of sensory neurons in the body. , the ability of humans and animals to see is dependent on sensory neurons in the eyes that are located in the retinal structure of this essential organ. these sensory neurons of the retinal eye are of two types. one is called rods and the other is called cons. these two types of sensory neurons are specialized in converting light waves into electrical signals that propagate through the optic nerve of the eye to the brain stem where they are perceived by other neurons that have synapses with the rods and cons neurons of the retina. this are of the brain is called the geniculate body. from there the signal proceeds through other synaptic neurons into the visual sensory cortex at the posterior part of the brain in humans.", "compare it to buying houses -- do you want to buy a dump for a pittance, spruce it up quickly, and unload it for a smaller but more immediate profit? or, do you want to buy a nice house with good “bones” but flaws that you can transform into a great house to keep or sell at a larger but longer-term profit? it’s your money, so consider your strategy carefully before you start buying. if you want to flip websites, you obviously need to buy “low” to have any chance of quickly making a profit. but it isn’t just about seeking out the biggest bargain. that dirt-cheap fixer-upper house may become a condemned money pit before you can flip it if you don’t do your homework first. if you’re looking elsewhere than wikihow for online advice on flipping websites, keep an eye out, because many advice sites are just sales pitches for an e-book or how-to seminar. maybe that is something that interests you, but don’t get roped in unwillingly. that said, some of these sales-pitch sites do make good points. for instance, one sensibly compares website buying to billionaire warren buffett’s investment strategy -- buy established, good companies (websites) that are undervalued and that you can make better.it’s not always the cheapest or fastest route, but often offers the best return.; , be realistic about the time and money you can spend to make a site better, your level of familiarity with website design and operation, and your knowledge of the product/service/information offered by a site. are you buying with the intent of making money by generating more ad revenue? this is one of the most popular strategies, but make sure you understand search engine optimization (seo). there is a science (as well as an art) to directing traffic (and thus ad revenue) to a website. consider buying a site with traffic targeted toward a product or service that you already produce or sell. use it to complement what you already know and do. you may also have opportunities for streamlining or merging operations as well -- saving money is a way of making money too!think about buying a site in an underutilized niche. seek out sites with the potential to have a popular keyword niche for search engines, or sites with built-in communities of members/fans whose support is not being effectively monetized. such sites offer customer/brand loyalty but have often been haphazardly assembled over time.if you have the skills to build a functional website that will more efficiently draw in traffic and revenue, this may be for you. , websites are a buyer’s market

they are also the legends of utilising complex riffs and ph in their riffs. also, do not confuse grindcore music with brutal death metal, they are totally different thing too.; ,, they are part of a genre known as \"deathcore\" which, while similar to death metal, it is not the same thing. you must be able to appreciate the music. , this article is going to focus on guitar specifically. now, let's get started. you are going to need a guitar meant for death metal in order to play that genre correctly. you do not need an expensive guitar. a decent guitar with good pickups and a decent amp will give you a good enough sound. brands you should look for would include ibanez, jackson, b.c.rich, schecter, esp, or dean. if you really want to spice up your tone you can get one of these guitar with emg pickups. , in order to play in these low tunings comfortably, you need to have your strings set to a heavy gauge. this basically means that the higher the gauge, the heavier the strings. a good gauge to start on would be 10 gauge. as you get more experienced, you can and must go to higher gauges. the average gauge for the experienced player is usually 12 gauge. remember, every time you switch to a higher gauge, you must have your truss rod adjusted. this is a metal rod in the neck of the guitar that keeps it straight. if your neck is bent improperly, then your guitar will keep going out of tune and prevent you from playing properly. the higher the gauge gets, the more pressure is put upon your guitar neck. you can get this adjusted usually, at any guitar shop, just ask. , the

sure that the fit is just right and looks good on you. if you don't have a tank top to use as a template, don't worry. you can still make a tank top.; , the shirt does not need to fit well, unless you want a fitted tank top. if the shirt is a brand new shirt, wash and dry it first. fabric tends to shrink after you wash it the first time, and you want the shirt to be the right size before you start working on it. , even if your shirts are already nice and smooth, it might be a good idea to do this. ironing will smooth the fabric and make it easier to work with. , lay the t-shirt flat on a table, then lay the tank top over it. make sure that the shoulders of the tank top are aligned with the shoulders of the t-shirt. also, make sure that the front of both shirts is facing upwards. , place straight pins all along the edges of the tank top. take care to pin all the way through all layers of both shirts. this will keep the shirts from moving, and make your cutting more even. , if you'd like a finished hem around the armholes and neckline, leave a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. a finished hem is not a requirement for t-shirt tank tops, as the fabric does not fray. a finished hem will look nicer, however. if you don't have a tank top to use as a guide, cut the sleeves and collar off of your t-shirt. consider folding the shirt in half before cutting it, so that both sides will be even., take the pins out and put the tank top away. make sure that the t-shirt is still inside out at this point. you won't be turning it right side out until the very end. , some tank tops will have a lower neckline in the front than in the back. the same goes for the armholes. don't trim too much off, if you plan on having finished hems; remember to leave a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. , fold the edges down by ½-inch (1.27 centimeters). secure the folds with straight pins, and press them flat with an iron. when folding, make sure that you are folding towards the outside, not the inside. if you'd like the edges to be raw and un-hemmed, you can skip this step. t-shirts are made from jersey material, which does not fray. , you can sew by hand or use a sewing machine for more professional, durable stitches. if you are using a sewing machine, try to use a stitch intended for knit fabrics. it looks like a straight stitch, except that it is broken up

child's space. these elements can make their allergies worse. check for mold and mildew in areas that are often wet, such as the bathroom. check the windows in your child's room for mold spots as well as any areas on the ceiling.the best way to get rid of mold and mildew is by using chlorine cleaners. bring in professionals to remove and repair the sources of significant or recurring mold accumulations. , clean the carpets in your child’s room and your home on a weekly basis by vacuuming them. carpet can hold in allergens that can make your child’s symptoms worse, such as dust mites

hardwood floors that don’t accumulate allergens and easier to clean than carpet. , if you have dogs or cats at home, try to keep them out of your child’s space. pets carry dander that can make your child’s allergies worse. you may get in the habit of keeping your child’s door closed during the day so the pets cannot get in there. or you may create a fenced off area so your pets cannot get into other rooms in your home.you should also get in the habit of keeping the windows in your child’s room closed. this will prevent airborne allergens from getting into their room as well as any pets that

emotions and behaviour, including your reaction to bad weather, broken racquets, bad line calls, snapped nets, noisy crowds, etc. confidence - your certain belief that you can manage anything on the court.; , winning will come from better aligned focus, and getting the basics right. how can you get the basics right if you spend your time focusing on winning the point instead of focusing on hitting the ball? think of your concentration level as a limited bucket. if use up your concentration on trying to win, hitting a winner or the previous point you lost or won, then you have less concentration to spend on hitting that next ball. this leads to more unforced errors. , tennis is a short game when you think about it, and many players dwell on how they should have won that last point, what they did wrong, or how to win the next point. this takes away from your concentration bucket and causes more unforced errors. , by enjoying each point, and focusing on the enjoyment each strike brings, you will naturally focus on the ball. keep your eye on the ball. this is the key to good tennis, and you will naturally hit better shots. , instead of trying to win the point, try thinking about how to make the rally longer. after all, you are here to play tennis and the enjoyment it brings should be at the forefront of the game's purpose. by trying to make the point longer, you will distract yourself from focusing on winning the point, and instead point that focus on hitting the ball correctly. after all, to make the point last longer, you need to hit more balls in, which means you need to focus on the ball and hitting it correctly. , if the opportunity presents itself then take it, but do not force the winner. by looking for winners, you are taking away from your concentration bucket, leaving less for focusing on the ball. , when you start losing, don't step back and start playing like a weak player. know that you have done this before and that you can play at this level. most of the time you will start to focus on how many points you have lost, and how poorly you are playing. this will take away from your concentration bucket, and leave you with nothing to hit the ball with. , substitute an enjoyment of guiding the ball to its desired location. when you guide the ball, your concentration becomes focused on the ball, rather than on you. your strokes will become naturally longer with the correct follow through, and power will come when you learn to co-ordinate", "apart from it being a fantastic way to make some extra cash, you're resume building, too! ask those in your neighborhood or family friends at even the slightest mention of a vacation or being too busy to walk the dog. and when you do it once successfully, you'll likely be asked to do it again. mention to your new network that you're considering making this a career, so if they could drop any of their other soon-to-be-departing or dog-owning friends of your interest, that'd be great! right now is the time for shameless advertisement. in time, you won't have to do it at all. this stage is all about building up a reputation. whatever you do, don't risk damaging it

however, it's a lot easier to get experience and clients (and meet other people with acumen in the dog-walking business) if you join an agency. , obtaining a dog handling certification would build some serious credibility with clients. some schools, such as the canine club academy, offer full-tuition scholarships.and the best agencies may even require you to obtain it, either before becoming a

to be insured; if you're working with an agency, hopefully they took care of that for you. but if you're thinking about doing it on your own time, it's something not to be taken lightly. get to know your city's layout, too. the less you're driving around wasting money on gas, the better. know the parks, the hidden hideaway spots, the dog parks, and back trails you can frolic with your new furry

surrogacy, an egg and sperm join to form an embryo. this embryo is then implanted into the woman who will carry and bear the child. with a gestational pregnancy, the surrogate is not a biological parent of the child.with a traditional surrogacy, the surrogate is impregnated through artificial insemination. in other words, the donor’s sperm fertilizes the surrogate’s egg. in this situation, the surrogate is also the biological mother of the child.both types of surrogacy are allowed in the state of florida provided the surrogacy contract comports with the state statute.; , florida has two statutes that cover surrogacy: one for traditional (or genetic) surrogacy and one for gestational surrogacy. you should read the florida statutes so that you understand what is required of surrogates and what is allowed or disallowed as part of a surrogacy contract. the applicable statutes are available at this attorney’s website. , in florida, it is illegal to pay a fee for a child. in fact, paying or receiving fees that are unrelated to the pregnancy may be a criminal offense. however, certain surrogacy expenses related to the pregnancy can be compensated. you can be reasonably compensated for the following expenses:legal medical psychological or psychiatric living expenses wages lost due to the pregnancy inconvenience, discomfort, and medical risk , if you haven’t been pregnant before, then you should try to read up as much as possible on how pregnancy will affect your life. this impact includes time missed from work for appointments with the obstetrician or for childbirth. even if you have had normal pregnancies in the past, you may encounter complications, which could result in hospitalization or bed rest. also, think about how attached you might become to the child. many women grow very attached to a child that they have nurtured in the womb for nine months. giving that child up can be emotionally challenging. at the same time, backing out of your surrogacy contract could be stressful and emotionally taxing on the intended parents as well. you should think carefully before deciding to become a surrogate. if you have children, you should also consider how the pregnancy will affect them.think about how you will explain to your children that the child you are carrying will not be returning home with you after you go to the hospital for delivery. , in florida, you cannot advertise your services as a surrogate. instead, you must work through either an attorney or an agency. an attorney can be invaluable throughout the entire surrogacy

let on that he doesn't even feel so great. he is tired. genuinely, pooped. he just wants a bit of space to recover his lost energy, so he's withdrawing for a week of snooze catch-up. he has experienced a family issue. he is uncomfortable talking to you about it because he has issues with his crazy/possessive/insane/angry/moralizing/whatever family and it's just all too hard to go into the gritty details. he'd rather you didn't get involved because once you are, awful entanglements will ensue. this can be a very protective stance, both ways. he has hit a snag at work. the deadline is looming, the boss is breathing down his neck, the job's future is precarious. he's salvaging what is left of his work opportunity, and you are suddenly a distraction. , if you think that you might have been a bit too \"full on\", try pulling back for a while and giving him back the space that you've tried to inhabit. this doesn't mean withdrawing affection or not seeing him at all; it just means learning to pace yourself and take it easy. don't text or call him for an entire day. try to stick with it. if he hasn't reached out to you at all during that day, talk with him about what he expects out of a relationship. if you expect something that he won't give you, you may want to look elsewhere for a boyfriend. don't text or call him about pointless things. don't call him just because mindy broke up with seth when your boyfriend doesn't know either of those people. you may think it's important, but he probably doesn't. , getting sad and emotional about it just lowers your appeal and may be the goal of some chauvinistic men. be happy and smile more. your days will not be hindered by the fact that he is ignoring you. the happier you are, the more he'll want to feed off that happiness. , ask him if he's ignoring you for any", "as any experienced brewer will tell you, 80% of the secret of success is cleanliness. thoroughly clean and sanitize everything that is going to come in contact with your beer. the easiest way to do that is to use an electric dishwasher set at the high heat setting or use a powdered cleanser such as pbw (powdered brewery wash). do not use a scrubber that will scratch the surface of whatever you're scrubbing—pathogens love to grow in the grooves left behind, and they're almost impossible to sanitize. rinse well, then soak briefly in a bleach or iodine solution.; , rinse off bleach before using items using very clean potable or distilled water. do not assume tap water is sanitized for rinsing brewing equipment. if you're using bleach to sanitize, add one ounce (30ml) of bleach to five gallons (19 liters) of cold water, followed by one ounce (30ml) of white vinegar. do not mix the bleach and vinegar together before adding to the water! the vinegar will make the water more acidic, which helps the bleach sanitize. do not rinse iodine solutions, let equipment drip dry instead. note that bleach can cause unwanted flavours in your beer, and requires rinsing, which can introduce microorganisms to your sterilized equipment. if you want to sterilize your equipment properly, use either a food-grade cleanser or sanitizer such as one step no-rinse sanitizer, which requires no rinsing; or an iodine solution such as btf iodophor. remember, in beer brewing, you can do just about anything you want, and add anything you want, to make whatever kind of beer you want—but proper sanitizing is the most important thing you can do. take the time and the energy to do it right. , that includes cleaning and sanitizing as outlined, and also includes having all your ingredients prepared and measured in advance. , before you begin your foray into home brewing, get a notebook, and note down everything you do—the cleaning process, what strain of yeast, the amount and specific type of malt, what variety of hops, and any specialty grains or other ingredients used to produce your beer. this will allow you to reproduce any given brew, or provide a basis for experimentation and improvement. , put any specialty grains into a grain bag (a mesh bag to contain the grains—like a tea bag, only a lot bigger) and steep them in the large stock pot in three gallons (10 liters) of hot water (around 150°f (66°c) for about 30 minutes. remove the grains and allow the water to drip out of the grain bag, into the pot. do not squeeze the bag, because you may extract tannins that will give your beer an astringent flavor. , the hops are usually added at various intervals to add flavor, bitterness, or aroma and the times will be spelled out for you in the kit's instructions for your style of beer. in general, hops added early in the boil will contribute more bitterness, but at the expense of flavor and aroma. hops added at the end of the boil", "square your hips, legs, and shoulders to all face the same direction. one side of your body should not be higher the than the other, and your weight should be evenly distributed.; , the

population to help raise awareness in your community. people will be more receptive to your campaign if it is something they can connect with. assist your local community, workplace, or schools with establishing a reporting system to make it easier for victims to seek help. communities, workplaces, and schools can use these procedures to help identify easy and practical ways for victims to report bullying or harassment. they are also able to use these reports to track bullying and harassment trends over time so that they can develop better prevention procedures. if you are in school, you could start an anti-bullying group, or talk to your school’s leadership about things that could be done to help prevent bullying at your school., if you're online and see other people talking badly about

prepared habitat, use a small mesh net to collect and transfer the frogspawn.make sure you can put the frogspawn directly into their new habitat. raise the tadpoles separately from other aquatic animals. they should get their own habitat. , when tadpoles are first hatched, you should have a quantity of fresh pond weed, partly as food and partly as support for young tadpoles. dried stinging nettle leaves crushed into a fine powder can also be fed to the young tadpoles.scatter the pond weed and nettle leaves across the surface of the water. tadpoles eat only vegetarian fare until their legs start to grow. , tadpoles in the wild normally feed on algae, but this may be difficult to find where you life. feeding each tadpole two tablespoons of boiled lettuce or spinach is a good substitute for algae. vegetarian fish flakes are another option, but avoid any fish flakes that incorporate animal byproducts. you should feed your tadpoles twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.add two crushed rabbit food pellets to supplement the diet of each tadpole. you don't need to feed them this more than once a day. twice a week, you can add some hardboiled egg yolk to their diet to provide protein. , calcium is necessary to build the young bones of your tadpoles. the easiest way to do this is to add 2 drops of liquid calcium per liter of water, or 4 drops per gallon.read the label carefully to make sure it doesn't contain additives that may be harmful to your tadpoles. adding a piece of cuttlebone (a sea shell) to the tank will also provide a nice, natural source of calcium. , you'll know that the water needs changing if you notice a cloudy appearance or unpleasant odor to the water. watch for tadpoles lingering near the surface or waste settling at the bottom of the tank. make sure that any new water is the same temperature as the water already in the tank– drastic changes in water temperature can kill your tadpoles.to clean your tank, you will need to have a second location where you can keep the tadpoles while you clean the inside of their tank. if your water isn't very dirty, you can leave the tadpoles in their habitat, while removing about a third of the water. never use commercial cleaning products, which may contain harmful chemicals a clean tank will help prevent your tadpoles from getting infected or diseased. , ranavirus is the most common virus to affect cold-blooded amphibians like tadpoles. tadpoles affected by ranavirus may appear lethargic, or you might notice them swimming erratically, weakly, or on their sides.bacterial

entirely up to you. some of the more modern offerings and entirely traditional offerings are: a shade. now, more than ever, industrial playground builders are becoming creative in the wake of more exposure to the sun. a large shade can be used in place of mature trees, if no trees can be found. a set of swings. a typical swingset will include at least 1 traditional swing and perhaps an identical one next to it or a modified horse swing where potentially 2 people can sit and push while pulling and make the swing 'go.' alternatively, a baby swing can be placed next to the traditional swing or, more recently, a handicapped swing, with full-buckling ability can be used. an industrial set can include up to four or five swings. you can alter their heights to allow for shorter legs vs. longer legged pre-teens. climbing things. rock walls have become welcome additions to swingsets, allowing children more options. a rock-wall pattern can even be used in a more personal swing set, to allow for children's climbing up to a slide area. towers. a tower area gives rise to the imagination, as well as an appropriate height for both slides and zip lines and dual towers allows for the plank walkways that make those satisfying rumbles as well as a little bounce in your step. children delight in taking turns jumping and forcing a jounce in the other child's step. tire swings. a tire swing is an alternative style swing that allows children to tackle the swinging thing up to three at a time. spin or sway, its up to the children. slides. slides can be short or long and they can spiral or go straight or go bump, bump, bump. slides have come a long way since the 50s and 60s when they were all made out of metal. now slides can be made out of plastics, just beware of the static electricity build up. tunnels. tunnels are great ways to get a child's inner energy out and the best thing is, it can go under the swingset or next to it or be used for an obstacle course. made out of plastic, make sure its covered by shade as these can get really hot in the sun. telephone cans. modern telephone cans are funnels which have sprinkler-type heads. the connecting tubing can be buried

litter and trash on the ground and recycle what can be recycled. always wear gloves and use a stick to pick up items rather than putting your hands into holes etc. , instead of littering, it is important to recycle items that are recyclable and to properly dispose of other items. littering is not only unpleasant to look at but it attracts vermin, it makes a mess of animal homes and it is a waste of products that can be", "after the lender repossesses the car, it should send you some notices in the mail. one notice should inform you of how you can redeem your car. the notice should also tell you the deadline for redeeming the car and the redemption amount. if you don’t receive this notice within five days of repossession, then contact the lender.you must get the full amount in order to redeem the car. redemption is not “reinstatement.” when you reinstate a loan, you pay any missed monthly payments. the loan then continues on as usual. with redemption, you must pay the entire balance of the loan. note the deadline and commit to getting the full amount before then. you have no right to reinstatement, so redemption might be your only way of getting the car back.; , it can’t hurt to call up the lender and ask if you could redeem the car for less than the price the lender is asking.the lender will have to sell your car at auction, and there is always a chance that the only buyer will make a low offer. the lender could lose money on the sale. the lender might be asking for $7,500, but you might only be able to gather together $6,000. if so, you should call and explain your situation. , you probably don’t have the money to redeem your vehicle. if you did, you wouldn’t have missed your monthly payments in the first place.accordingly, you need to try and get a loan for the full redemption amount. your friends and family might be able to forward you some money. try to get a loan interest-free or low interest. for example, if the redemption price is $10,000, then your monthly payments on a five-year loan will be about $175 a month with a two percent interest rate. however, if your interest rate is eight percent, then you would end up paying almost $200 a month. talk to your family and friends. they might be willing to loan you the money for a low interest rate (or without charging interest at all). if they agree to loan you money, then you should draft a loan document. , if your friends or family won’t loan to you, then you should seek a low-interest loan from other sources. look into loans from local credit unions. before taking out any loan, make sure that you can make the monthly payments. there is no reason to take out another loan if you will only default on repayments in the future. to calculate your monthly car payment, you can use one of the many calculators on the internet. plug in the amount of the loan, the length of the loan, and the interest rate. you will then get a monthly payment amount., you should promptly notify the lender of your intent to redeem the car. your right to redeem will end once the car is sold, so you need to reach out to the lender quickly.typically, lenders hold onto cars for only 10-15 days before selling them at auction.you shouldn’t take too", "someone who shares traits with the stereotypical \"alpha male\" might occasionally act stubborn, impatient, and demanding, especially during quarrels.when he slips into these negative patterns, it is important that you do not act overly submissive or apologetic. instead, remain calm and analytical as you state your case. walk away from the argument if you need to, but do not flatter, pander, or give in too easily.some scripts you might use include: \"i can see that we're not going to reach an agreement tonight. let's continue talking about this tomorrow.\" \"i know that we don't agree on this. but here are the reasons why i think i'm right . . .\" \"i am happy to find middle ground, but i am not willing to let go of my core beliefs. it is important that you are willing to compromise if i am going to compromise too.\" , be careful if he acts aggressively by breaking things, making threats, or frequently raising his voice to the point that you end up in tears. this is not acceptable behavior, and you deserve better. leave the situation immediately if you feel personally threatened. let him know that his actions are unacceptable, and seek help outside of the relationship from a friend, the authorities, or a domestic abuse hotline. , in general, people are happy in relationships when there is an egalitarian power structure. in this case, both partners might share chores, have equal say over important decisions, and might both work outside of the home.these relationships are less likely to end in divorce or break-ups. , while egalitarian relationships are the most successful in the long run, they might also reduce libido and sexual passion.if you are attracted to dominance, consider finding ways for this dominance to be expressed, even if it does not impact your day-to-day decision-making. for example, you might consider: introducing a dominant/submissive role-play during sex. be sure to discuss your preferences and limitations in advance, and make sure that you can stop the role-play at any time by using a \"safe-word.\" finding outlets to perform traditional gender roles. for example, a woman might dress up in traditional feminine outfits; a man might dress up in athletic clothing.divide chores along gendered lines. if you are a woman in a heterosexual relationship, consider taking on some stereotypically feminine labor, such as cooking or washing dishes. ask your partner to take on stereotypically masculine labor, such as repairing the car. this might increase sexual attraction., many people who exhibit typical \"alpha\" traits communicate in a direct manner. they tend not to beat around the bush. try to keep this in mind so that you are not offended at how direct and straightforward their conversation is. instead, remember that direct communication can help a relationship avoid patterns of passive-aggression or mutual dissatisfaction: if your partner's bluntness is insulting or hurtful, however, these are warning signs that your partner is going well beyond \"direct\" communication and is instead hoping to injure your feelings. this is not a sign of confidence but of aggression, and you should consider", "if you already have a credit card, check your card agreement or your issuer's website to see whether you have a points reward program. this program allows you to earn points based on your purchases that can be redeemed for rewards like cash back, gift cards, or frequent flyer miles. contact your card issuer if you are unsure if your card qualifies for this type of program., if your current card doesn't offer points rewards or the chance to convert points to miles, you'll need to get a card that does. this type of reward is offered from almost all credit cards that offer points, but some options are better than others. search online to locate cards that allow you to transfer points to miles at a good rate. for example, the following rewards programs allows you to transfer points to miles at a rate of 1 to 1: american express member rewards. this is available to all american express cardholders. citi thank you. this is available on citi thank you cards and others. chase ultimate rewards. access this program by signing up for a chase sapphire preferred or ink plus for business card.there may be other cards offering a good transfer rate that are a better fit to your spending habits and financial situation. research terms for several different cards before making a decision. , many credit cards offer signup bonuses that immediately credit your rewards account a large number of points if you reach a certain spending milestone within a set time period. in many cases, this can be a significant number of points, perhaps 50,000 or 100,000. however, you should avoid simply spending to reach this limit, as this might cause you to overspend. instead, make sure that the spending milestone is in line with your regular spending patterns., points must be built up by making qualifying purchases on your credit card. the qualifications for a qualified purchase vary between card issuers, so check your card agreement to see what you should use your card for. for example, some point rewards programs offer a flat points rate for all purchases. however, others reward certain purchases, like gas or entertainment, at a higher rate. others might have a rotating high rewards category each month. wherever possible, put qualifying purchases on your credit card. this will help you earn points without changing your spending habits., even with signup bonuses and frequent credit card purchases, building up a points balance will take time. many flights you will want to take after converting your points will end up costing upwards of 30,000 miles. for example, a trip to europe from the us might cost 50,000 to 60,000 points. this means you'll have to take the time to build up a points balance before they will become truly useful., request a copy of your points program information from your credit card company by calling customer support. this information will also be available online through your card issuer's website. reward programs typically vary. different credit cards have different guidelines and restrictions and you should know", "to use association effectively, you can create an image in your mind to help you remember a word or an image. for example, if you have a hard time remembering that jfk was the president involved in the bay of pigs invasion, just picture the handsome president swimming in an ocean surrounded by happy, oinking pigs. this is absolutely silly, but this concrete image in your mind will forever help you link the president with this event.by creating a visual, your brain can fixate on a single, easy-to-identify piece of information. when you recall that single symbol, you can also recall the larger strand of information you assigned to it. for example, as you place your car keys in your purse, imagine your purse suddenly growing wheels and speeding away. since the image is such a strange one, you're more likely to remember it later, which will also help you remember that your car keys are inside it. the more unique or unusual the image is, the easier it will be for your brain to remember it., let's say you keep forgetting your student id every time you need to use it again. just break down the number into smaller chunks and create images associated with those chunks. let's say the number is 12-7575-23. find a way to make these numbers meaningful. let's say \"12\" happens to be your house number, \"75\" happens to be your grandmother's age, and the number \"23\" is michael jordan's jersey number. here's what you can visualize to remember the number: picture your house with two copies of your grandmother standing to the right, showing that the house comes first. then imagine michael jordan standing to the right of your grandmothers. there you have it -- 12 (your house), 7575 (double-dose of grandma) and 23, the basketball star. , chunking is a way of grouping things together to help you memorize them. random lists of things (a shopping list, for example) can be especially difficult to remember. to make it easier, try categorizing the individual things from the list. for example, list all of the fruits together, the dairy products together, and the bread products together. alternatively, you can chunk your list by the starting letter of each item; you need to pick up eggs, bread, bacon, coffee, and cheese from the grocery store, remember one e, two b's, and two c's. as long as you remember the correct numbers, you should be able to recall the items in each letter group. this will not only help you memorize the list, but it'll make your shopping experience much faster.if you can remember that, among other things, you wanted to buy four different kinds of vegetables, you’ll find it easier to remember all four. chunking is what we do when we list a phone number with dashes. which looks easier to memorize, 8564359820, or 856-435-9820? you probably won't remember 17761812184818651898, but try putting a space after every fourth number. now you can see that those numbers are years, and you can pick key events from each year to", "properly inflated tires can reduce fuel consumption by up to 3%. your tires also lose about 1 psi per month, and when the tires are cold (e.g., in the winter), their pressure will decrease due to the thermal contraction of the air. it is recommended to check tires at least monthly, preferably weekly. having properly inflated tires will also help you avoid uneven wear on the tread. some fuel stations have automatic air compressors that stop at a predetermined level. (for safety, double-check pressure with your own gauge, especially if another is suggesting you add a surprisingly large amount of air.) small permanently-installed valve-stem extensions can allow filling without removing the caps, but check that they are not prone to jamming with foreign matter and leaking. recommended inflation pressures are for cold tires; it is best to inflate first thing in the morning or you've driven less than two miles so your reading will be accurate. if you have been driving around for a while or it is hot outside, add 3 psi. inflate to the pressure recommended by your car's manual or the sticker on your driver-side doorpost. be aware that the reading stamped on the tire is the maximum tire pressure, not the recommended.; , a properly tuned engine maximizes power and can greatly enhance fuel efficiency. beware, though, that many tuners will disable efficiency measures when tuning for power. be sure you are keeping good spark plugs in the engine, changing the oil on time, making sure the air filter is clean, etc. , a dirty filter will reduce fuel economy, or make the engine stall when idling. just like mowing dusty grass, driving dusty dirt roads will clog the air filter: avoid dust clouds. , this will go a long way to enhancing fuel efficiency. , get the lightest car that will serve your needs. weight is one of the biggest causes for loss of kinetic energy in non-hybrid cars. if you're not shopping for cars, then take any extra weight off of the one you're already driving. if seats that you don't use can be removed, take them out. if you use your trunk as a storage space for heavy things, find another place for them. an extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 1–2%. (weight is most important in stop-and-go driving. in almost exclusively highway driving, it matters little: once the car is up to speed, it need only push air out of the way.) don't remove things from the car that you need frequently; instead, make sure these are in the car and readily accessible because wasted trips to retrieve or replace them will be much worse than a little lower mileage. , narrow tires have less frontal area, thus reducing aerodynamic drag. remember, however, that narrow tires have less traction as well (which is why race cars have such wide tires). do not get a tire that is incompatible with your wheels (use the size tires that came stock on the vehicle), and do not get smaller wheels unless your manufacturer approves. , these", "many states are moving forward with medical marijuana programs, but it's not available everywhere. programs are still controversial, and marijuana is still classified federally as a class 1 drug. if you're interested in using marijuana to treat your condition, find out the laws in your state regarding use by clicking here. states with medical marijuana programs in place include: west coast: arizona, colorado, california, montana, nevada, new mexico, oregon, and washington east coast: connecticut, delaware, new hampshire, massachusetts, vermont, new york, new jersey, rhode island, maine, and maryland midwest: michigan, minnesota, and illinois alaska, hawaii, and the district of columbia; , you won’t qualify for medical marijuana because you want to use it recreationally, even if recreational use is one of your goals. in most states, medical marijuana is only available to patients with pre-approved conditions, while other states, including california, make medical marijuana more widely available for a variety of conditions.in general, universal pre-approved conditions include: chronic and severe pain, including pain from arthritis, migraine headaches, and crohn’s disease aids chemo-related nausea hepatitis c multiple sclerosis asthma epilepsy alzheimer’s disease any terminal illness , without a severe illness, most general practitioners will not recommend the use of medical marijuana, unprompted. talk to your doctor about whether or not using marijuana might be right for your conditions and concerns and discuss your specific conditions that you think might be aided by medical marijuana. often, medical marijuana will be recommended as an alternative to more traditional forms of medication. if you've been on other medicines and they haven't helped, this can be a good in-road to talking about medical marijuana with your doctor. likewise, if you're feeling frustrated with nausea, sleeplessness, or other side-effects as a result of any medications that you're taking, medical marijuana can be an appropriate supplement to other prescriptions that you might be taking. , your general practitioner is the best doctor to talk to about any prescription, but many are hesitant to recommend the use of medical marijuana. often called “420 doctors” or “pot docs,” entrepreneurial doctors in many states with medical programs are available for a consultation fee and few questions asked. if you’re interested in using medical marijuana to relieve things like writers’ cramp and insomnia, say, a 420 doctor is probably the place to go. , make an appointment with your doctor or with a doctor who specializes in medical marijuana, and discuss your ailments and your desire to explore medical marijuana. you should walk out with a prescription in hand, which you can use to register as a user with the state and make your purchase from the dispensary. prescriptions and recommendations are legally protected under patient confidentiality laws. this doctor's recommendation will not be available to potential employers, law enforcement, and other inquiries., depending on what state you live in, registering as a medical marijuana user with the state may be mandatory or voluntary, but it’s important to understand the difference and the way in which registration can protect you legally. the purpose of the card is to identify you to vendors and", "your family, like most families, may have behaviors and actions you value. as your teen begins to push back against these values and your expectations, you may wish to decide which values you want to enforce above all others, and perhaps relax on your enforcement of other behaviors.write down a list of what you value most in your family. it could be actions like being generous, showing kindness, living your faith, or being of service to others. decide which of these values you will demand your teen to uphold, and decide that you will be more flexible about others. for example, you may decide to make “showing kindness” an enforced value, but perhaps could be more flexible on “living your faith,” letting your teen skip religious services now and again. tell your teen what you expect of them. you could say, “in our house, we value family above everything else. i’m not going to let you off the hook for sunday dinners with grandma. i will negotiate with you on other expectations, but not on family activities.” , give your teenager a certain amount of freedom to make their own decisions. they are rapidly approaching adulthood when they will need to hold themselves accountable, so give them the opportunity now to learn some skills under your watchful eye. consider giving your teenager more financial responsibility. they may have a part-time job, or perhaps you give them an allotted amount of spending money per week. teens enjoy being able to manage their own savings, and this is a great time for them to learn about managing money. don't interfere if you think they are making a stupid purchase -- this is all part of learning about money.let your teenager wear what they want, within reason and their school’s dress code. back off if they want to dye their hair or shave their head. it’s part of them expressing themselves. , if your teenager is irate, any attempts to restrict or discipline them will only be counterproductive. give him or her some time to cool off. if the situation calls for punishment, it can be dealt later.calmly approach them and continue the discussion after a while, later in the day, after both of you have had time to calm down. you could say, “now that we’ve both had a chance to cool off, i want to talk to you about what you did.” , adolescence is about becoming independent from your parents and determining your identity as an individual. make sure you are giving them the space they need to grow and figure themselves out, and alone time as necessary. while maintaining a solid connection is important, be sure not to smother them. be conscious of the importance of your teenager’s social life right now. allow them time with their friends. be aware of who they are hanging out with and where, but give them more freedom if you believe they are trustworthy., don’t expect your teenager to behave like an adult all of the time. even though they may look more grown up,", "the substance of your dispute will determine what you should do. consider the following common landlord-tenant disputes:your landlord won’t make necessary repairs. for example, your toilet might be backed up, or your apartment might lack sufficient heat. landlords need to keep their apartments in a habitable condition. your landlord enters your apartment without permission. typically, your landlord must give you written notice of when they will enter. your landlord has damaged your property. for example, your landlord might not have kept the roof in good repair. if it caves in and damages your property, you can sue. your landlord’s carelessness has injured you. the legal term for carelessness is “negligence.” for example, your landlord might have allowed the stairs to rot. if you break a leg climbing the stairs, you can sue for your injury. your landlord is retaliating against you for exercising a legal right. for example, they might not renew your lease because you tried to form a tenant's union or because you complained to the housing authorities about your landlord. your landlord isn’t following the lease. the lease is a binding contract, and your landlord made promises to do certain things. you can sue if your landlord fails to live up to their promises. your landlord has discriminated against you. it’s against the law to discriminate against someone because of their gender, race, color, religion, national origin, familial status, or disability.in some states or cities, it’s also illegal to discriminate because of sexual orientation.; , you’re an important witness to any dispute. as soon as possible, write out your memories. try to be as detailed as possible and sign the paper. for example, if your landlord enters your apartment without permission, then note the dates and times. if your landlord won’t make repairs, then write down the date you first noticed the problem. also summarize any oral conversations you’ve had with your landlord. write down what they said and what you said. , visual evidence is helpful since it shows the judge what you are complaining about.for example, if a stairwell is missing a step, take pictures. if you have a vermin infestation, record mice running around. you won’t be able to get visual evidence for everything, but it’s helpful if you have it. , when you sue, you need to present evidence to the judge. preserve documents that might be useful. consider saving the following: all communications with your landlord copy of your lease any receipts if you had to replace damaged items medical reports and medical bills, if you were injured police reports , explain what you want them to do to resolve the dispute. in some states, you need to send your landlord a letter and give them a chance to correct the problem before the court will let you sue. send your letter certified mail, return receipt requested, so that you have proof it was received. there are sample letters online. remember to maintain a professional tone, no matter how angry you may be. nevertheless, be firm. you

litany of organizations available you can join or donate to that are dedicated to reducing cruelty towards animals worldwide. do some research and find which organization appeals to your views. the humane society of america is one of the world's largest animal advocacy organizations. they target puppy mills, animal fighting, factory farming, seal slaughter, horse cruelty, and the slaughterhouse trade. the organization works through both large-scale political initiatives and hands-on efforts to rescue and care for unwanted animals.the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals (aspca) is another one of the better known animal advocacy organizations. much like the humane society of america, they oppose most forms of cruelty like slaughterhouses and puppy mills and also help curb animal population by encouraging spaying and neutering of house pets. they also encourage the development of no-kill shelters and provide practical assistance such as transporting adopted animals to new homes.people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta) is a well-known but somewhat controversial animal rights organization. peta focuses primarily on factory farms, the clothing trade, laboratory testing of animals, and use of animals in the entertainment industry. peta often conducts investigations of companies and labs and encourages direct political action in the form of protests, petitioning, and boycotts.peta, however, has met criticism for being more dedicated to publicity stunts than actually reducing cruelty to animals. in 2013, allegations surfaced that peta had euthanized many of the rescued animals at their virginia headquarters.you can also find a local animal shelter in your area and volunteer there. , if no existing organization appeals to you personally, you can always start a neighborhood watch in your area. invite your friends and neighbors to get to know the animals in your area and keep an eye out for suspicious behavior. be aware of the animals in your area. by being vigilant, and encouraging others to do the same, you'll be likely to notice potential problems, such as a formerly friendly dog suddenly becoming aggressive or skittish around people.there are many signs of animal abuse. physical signs include collars that are too tight, open wounds or signs of recently healed wounds, fur infested with fleas or ticks, patches of missing skin or rashes, and extreme thinness. pay attention to the animal's environment. are they tied up alone frequently? are they kept outside despite poor weather conditions, like intense heat or cold? is an animal kept in a small kennel, or one crowded with many other animals, for extended periods? encourage all members of your watch to stay vigilant, and if you notice any of the above signs of cruelty report it to your group and decide as a group how to proceed. , animal cruelty is a crime, and if you see abuse happening do not hesitate to report it to the proper authorities. where to report cruelty depends on your state. contacting the local humane society is a good first step, as the workers there usually know what law agency to contact. you can also visit a local police station and ask for", "there are a variety of seeds that qualify as \"organic.\" for many gardeners, the main characteristic of an \"organic seed\" is that it is grown in organic soil and not treated with any pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or herbicides. identification labels for organic seeds will signify whether a seed is originally propagated from an organic plant. look for labels on seed packets, in catalogs or online. look for untreated seeds. a \"u\" will identify seeds that are untreated, meaning they have had no chemical or synthetic fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides. check for an \"o,\" which identifies organic seeds, or those that have been taken from organically grown plants. look for open-pollinated seeds. open pollination refers to seeds that have been pollinated by natural means, either by birds, bees, wind or through self-pollination (seeds that are naturally capable of reproducing themselves). these seeds will be labeled with an \"op.\" look for an \"h.\" this stands for heritage (or heirloom) seeds, which carry qualities of a particular plant that has been cultivated. heritage seeds are those that have been carried down from a particular seed that the grower felt created a healthy, desirable plant. heritage seeds are usually the result of cross-pollination from 2 types of seeds that created the new cultivar.; , choosing locally grown organic seed will allow for better adaptation to your soil and garden environment. shop at local nurseries or choose from local seed catalogs. look in the phone book or online for nurseries or landscapers in your area. they will be able to tell you if they sell organic seeds, and they often will recommend seeds based on local growing conditions. most nurseries, and even garden departments at home improvement stores, carry seed catalogs from top seed distributors. ask fellow gardeners what they have enjoyed growing from organic seed, or ask your local farmers and vendors at the farmer's markets. farmers and gardeners in your area will have the expertise to recommend what type of seeds have grown best for them, as well as information on special heritage or heirloom seeds. many farmers who grow organically have created their own heirloom seeds, and may even sell or trade them along with their produce. , the internet allows for many seed distributors, co-ops and other organic plant producers to provide consumers with purely organic seeds that they have certified. you also will have the benefit of browsing through many varieties of seeds online. recently seeds are also sold in general marketplaces like ebay or garden marketplaces like myseedz. start a search. begin by browsing keywords, such as \"organic seeds\" or \"certified organic.\" look for certified organic seeds. a website that is selling seeds should provide certification for organic requirements. although requirements vary, a reputable seed distributor will have the certification listed. in the united states, for example, there will be a certification number provided. this ensures that you are purchasing seeds that are organic and untreated. search for online vendors that have been established. signs of longtime vendors include their age of operation, whether they are licensed with the better business", "in order to do this wrap you’ll need lotion, clear plastic wrap and an elastic reusable bandage (like the kind you’d use on a sprained wrist). once you’ve obtained the necessary items, perform the following instructions right before you go to bed:apply the lotion to your stomach and waist area in a thick layer. don’t massage the lotion too much into your skin. wrap the clear plastic wrap around your waist, on top of where you put the lotion. you may need to wrap the plastic two to three times around your waist. the plastic wrap should not be loose, but should be tight enough that it doesn’t fall off. wrap the elastic bandage around your waist on top of the plastic wrap. secure the bandage to your body by tucking the end into the portion already wrapped around. sleep with the wrap on all night and remove it in the morning. you’ll likely notice a small difference in your waist size, but note it’s only temporary.; , corsets come in many different types, depending on what you’re trying to accomplish. ‘real’ corsets designed to trim your waistline have steel boning and multiple layers of non-stretchy fabrics. you can buy a ready-made corset at a lingerie store, or you can have one custom made for you.corsets can help your waist look 2 – 4” smaller just by wearing them. corsets, because they’re tight, can also help you eat less as you’ll feel full faster. alternatively, you can also try wearing shapewear, which can help make you look thinner as well, but uses a different material than corsets. plus you can buy shapewear that’s also underwear, camisoles, etc., the key to dressing so you look thinner is to avoid items like capris, pleated pants, long baggy shorts or shapeless skirts that only go down to your calf. ensure the clothes you wear fit you properly, and choose items like the following:dark-coloured jeans or pants that go down to your ankle or 1-2” below your ankle; long shirts, blazers, or non-baggy sweaters; knee-length pencil skirts; or fitted a-line skirts. maxi skirts. these are another great option to make you look thinner because they give you a longer vertical line and make your legs look longer. solid colours work best. avoid skirts with pleats, big pockets, layers and thick elastic waistbands. pair a maxi skirt with a fitted top and heels. jeans that have a higher-rise or waist. lower-rise jeans, while stylish, unfortunately can create the muffin top look around your waist, which does not look at all flattering. as with many other clothing pieces, higher-rise jeans make your legs look longer, which in turn makes you look thinner. tuck your shirt into your jeans as well. skinny belts to cinch shirts, dresses and even coats. this helps to define your natural waistline and shows off your curves. try wearing heels. to help make your legs look slimmer and elongate your whole body, wear heels that are at least 2.5” or taller. it also helps to wear heels with a somewhat pointed toe, as opposed", "skins characters are always dressed with their personalities in mind, so think of what kind of person you are.

very dark and this shows in her clothes. in the first season, she wears kind of an emo style with clothing that show off her body and striped red and black stripes (but this is only a night/not at

these procedures, so it is important to understand which type of operation will be happening to you.a supracervical or subtotal hysterectomy involves the removal of the upper part of the uterus only, while the cervix stays in place. a total hysterectomy involves the removal of the whole uterus and cervix. a radical hysterectomy involves the removal of the whole uterus, tissue on the sides of the uterus, the cervix, and the top part of the vagina. this is typically only done when cancer is present. your hysterectomy may or may not involve removal of the ovaries (a procedure called \"oophorectomy\").; , an open surgery, or abdominal hysterectomy, is the most common type, comprising 65% of procedures. this method involves a 5–7 inch abdominal incision, through which the appropriate organs are removed. an mip hysterectomy (or minimally invasive procedure) may be vaginal (where an incision is made inside the vagina, through which the organs are removed — known as a transvaginal hysterectomy) or laparoscopic (which is a surgery done using a laparoscope, through one or more small tiny incisions, often through the belly button). sometimes mip hysterectomies will be a combination of vaginal/laparoscopic techniques.an open surgery hysterectomy usually results in a three-day hospital stay. mip hysterectomies generally involve reduced hospital stays, quicker recovery times, less scarring, and a lowered risk of infection. an mip hysterectomy results in a three to four week recovery period to resume full activity, compared to a five to six week recovery with an abdominal procedure. not all women will be suited for an mip hysterectomy. factors such as scar tissue, obesity, and health status can all affect whether or not an mip is good choice for you. , a hysterectomy is considered a \"moderate risk\" procedure.fortunately, most women who have this surgery experience no complications; however, as with any medical procedure, some complications do occur for a small percentage of women. it is important to educate yourself on what could happen, even though the risk is small. some complications include:urinary incontinence vaginal prolapse fistula formation chronic pain blood clots infection frequent urination heavy bleeding (hemorrhage) early menopause complications due to general anesthesia , the most common physical result of a hysterectomy is the early onset of menopause. if your ovaries will be removed during the procedure, you will experience the onset of menopause right away. if your ovaries will remain, you will still likely experience menopause at an earlier age than you would have otherwise. additionally, after your hysterectomy, you will be advised to abstain from sexual activity or heavy lifting for a minimum of six weeks. on the bright side, after the recommended recovery period, most women report an immediate relief from reproductive pain, problems, and discomfort. , before your surgery, gather enough information to feel comfortable about the surgery. generate a list of questions for your doctor, and talk to them until you feel all of your concerns have been", "yes, you are on our own. however, this does not mean that you need to be alone. there is a difference between being on your own and being lonely; what you choose to do and who you choose to see will make all the difference.; , accepting your situation allows you to do something about it. making plans for the future, which could be another four decades or so, is a vital activity for giving you back a sense of direction and purpose. , while men in their 50s may be considered esteemed and a \"good catch\", women in this age group often feel invisible and less desirable. media messaging reinforces the invisibility of older women, through such things as pairing older men with very young co-stars in hollywood movies, rampant coverage of young female starlets in magazines, yet not showing older women anywhere near as much, while showing older men well into their 90s as powerful and even sexy, and so forth. these are images principally pushed by the advertising and entertainment industries and they do not reflect reality. whatever your gender and age, you remain an important and valued member of society. do not allow yourself to feel devalued by the incessant drive to sell aspirational products and lifestyles. , embrace this time of your life. be positive about everything. smile at everyone.your life will change and become full of love. , look for friends with people of your own gender first. then consider finding friendships with people of the opposite gender, without having romantic pressure. let what may be come of its own accord. in time, romance may blossom with someone you've reached out to. women may feel that this stage of life turns into a competition for the best guy out there. however, realize that you're all feeling vulnerable and there can be strength in joining together and supporting one another. just soften a tiny bit and open up to other women who are feeling just as vulnerable as you are; they just have a weird way of showing it. , this way, you will meet people with similar interests, from all walks of life. when you share an interest with others, age does not matter, so you have the chance to make friends across age groups and to learn from each other. , it can be depressing and bad for the soul if you feel rejected on it often. in your age group, there is also a risk of coming across people who are misfits and worst of all, married! if you want to find people through this means, be very selective and use your decades of experience to root out the suspicious ones. when actually dating, sum up the date quickly, so that you don't over-invest yourself in somebody who is just going to suck you dry or be a complete loss. that said, it is possible to find someone you really connect with through online dating, so don't dismiss it; it has become the norm for many people now. , donate every piece of clothing", "when your friendship ends, it is important that you accept that and resolve your feelings. you can write a letter to your friend expressing all of your feelings (you don’t have to send it to them), or you can create a ritual to symbolize the end of the friendship. to be happy, you will need to acknowledge the your feelings, process them, and move on to the next stage of your life.in your letter, you might write about how the friendship started off great, but then went downhill. include the details of what ended the friendship, how it made you feel, and be sure to clearly state that it is over. for a ritual to symbolize the end of your friendship, you might consider taking an item that your friend gave you and burying it, burning it, or simply throwing it away. make sure that whatever you do resonates with you as closing the door to this friendship.; , start with small changes like eating well. try to avoid venting your anger too much or too often. do things that you enjoy doing, and allow yourself to do thoughtful things for someone else. this can be daunting, but you have to push through because happiness is largely in your control.go watch movies that you like, eat at your favorite restaurants, and try new things to see what makes you happiest. , there are many reasons that you might end your friendship, but it is possible that your ex best friend will want to rekindle it later on. if you are caught off guard, you might regret the decision you make. think about what you will say to your ex best friend if they ever mention being friends again.you might even practice saying something like “i am flattered that you want to be my friend again, but i think it’s best we don’t go there,” in front of the mirror. , you will probably be hurt by what your friend says about you, even if they stick to the truth. the key to dealing with this kind of drama, though, is to ignore it. if you decide to “set the record straight” you will be playing into a vicious friend feud that can go on for a long time. not only does this jeopardize your other friendships, but it also keeps you from moving on.for example, if your former friend is spreading rumors about you at school, you should ignore the rumors rather than spread bad things about your friend in retaliation. , nobody wants to pick sides. it isn’t fair to ask your mutual friends to do so. avoid gossiping about your ex best friend, especially with mutual friends. you should also refrain from sending any messages back and forth between mutual friends.never say things to your friends like “next time you see them, tell them i said that they are a liar!” , avoid talking to your former friend. distance yourself from the things that you used to do together, and change any routines that heavily involved your former friend. there", "this gas is produced as organic aka living things rot. the female fly has a sense of smell for this gas and are attracted to

methane gas/rot., female flies smell the rotting meat scraps in the garbage can and will flock to it. make note of your community garbage truck day of the week. try to dump your meat scraps the night or day before to limit the time the flies will smell it. if you can't use this timing, place all your meat scraps into a zip lock bag and freeze them until that day. , the bones and fat can be placed in a pot of water and boiled overnight and seasoned. this is also less expensive and more flavorful than prepared box broth in the store. the boiled bones and meat will have less meat smell thus attracting fewer flies. give your leftover meat bones to your dog for crunching. dogs like to chew on things and meat bones are their favorites. just make sure the bones however are not too sharp to cut the animals throat. you can also give dogs the gristle and boiled and cooked meat scraps as a treat. although you should talk to a vet before doing this. , maggots don't need much meat or meat juice food to develop into more flies so cleaning up all meat juice and meat smells will starve them and prevent them for turning your trash can into a buffet. use the same techniques when discarding tools and equipment used to cut meat. also clean the rags used in cleaning up the meat juice and newspaper clippings used in preparation (keeping the fish scales neater instead of all over the place) with scalding hot water or in a tightly sealed bag or container before tossing out. , not only is a smelly trash can a maggot magnet but a disgusting thing to smell for you and those who live in or visit your house. rinse your trash can even if it's every 2 or 3 months with plain water during the warm seasons to keep the maggots away and the trash can smelling decent. , place such trash in sealed containers. kitty litter, feminine products, leftover pet food,dirty diapers need to have their bags tightly closed so the stable fly can't smell the methane gas and want to lay eggs in the trash can. same goes for manure and animal bedding including hay and straw. don't put dead animals in the household trash either. don't put rotting plant matter in the same can as the household trash. if you do you'll have triple trouble with stable flies, blow flies and houseflies. put it in a separate landscape bag or in a sealed container before tossing it out into the trash can. , cold weather

or what is the purpose of hiring? recruiters mostly ask irrelevant questions during an interview just because of lack of information. they are themselves not clear about their job. in other words, they do not really know what they should ask to judge candidate skills. this is why it's so important to set hiring goals before starting the interview process create a one page document that mentions the things you are looking for in the candidate or the things you won’t compromise upon while making a hiring decision. for instance, your hiring goal can be to find a marketing manager, aged above 40 having extraordinary communication skills and past experience of serving in a medium or large organization.; , another common reason recruiters ask bad interview questions that are totally irrelevant to the job is their lack of knowledge regarding the job posts being filled. there is no logic checking leadership skills while hiring a sales worker or checking communication skills while hiring an i.t. expert. you should know the job duties for the relevant post so that you may ask questions accordingly. it is recommended that you read the job description before taking the interview. create a one page document mentioning the key job responsibilities, then ask questions on the basis of job duties instead of asking random questions , it is better to create a checklist of all the questions to be asked beforehand in order to avoid asking bad interview questions. if you are new in the recruitment team then this tip is especially for you. creating a checklist does not mean that you have to strictly follow it. you may also ask any other question that comes in your mind at the time of taking the interview. the purpose of creating checklist is just to remain focused. read the job description and check hiring goals while making checklist, or get a checklist made from an experienced recruiter. double check the questions to ask to make sure that all of them are relevant to the job. , it is very important for recruiters to put aside their personal preferences and biases when giving interviews. asking confusing, irrelevant and difficult questions from candidate just because he or she is a certain rare, religion or gender is neither logical nor ethical. don’t let your personal feelings affect the interview process and educate yourself about possible biases you have to avoid. set the same standards for everyone irrespective of their age, gender, race, ethnicity etc. , many recruitment teams interview hundreds of people in one day from early morning till evening. this is not a good practice as it may affect the hiring decision. recruiters are so tired sometimes that they start asking strange questions that are in no way relevant to the job post. you must stop the interview process after you get tired in order to avoid this issue. take a short break after conducting every", "most people have a dominant leg, and it typically gets more work than your

you can lean against a wall if you have difficulty balancing. , squat box jumps can be dangerous if not done with proper form. make sure you use a relatively low box, and practice to get your form down correctly before you add this exercise to your regular routine.to do squat box jumps, lower into a regular squat. instead of standing, jump onto the box from the squat position. focus on maintaining your squat position throughout the jump. step back to start and repeat. make sure both feet are landing squarely on the box, otherwise you might end up banging your shins on the edge. , if you have a step or a stool, bulgarian split squats provide a good lower body exercise that also engages your core to stabilize your body.set the stool behind you so that you can rest the toes of one foot on it from a standing position with your knees slightly bent. place your hands behind your head, elbows extended out to the sides. lower yourself into a squat, allowing your back leg to bend.

legs of a ballet dancer, you might enjoy the plié squat, which borrows a position from ballet to help tone your hips and thighs.stand in a wide stance with your toes turned out, and place your hands on your hips. bend your knees out over your toes, lowering your body into a squat. when your thighs are parallel to the floor, raise your heels so that you're standing on your toes. raise and lower your heels 10 times. return to a standing position to complete one repetition. do five repetitions of this exercise. , the pistol squat is an extremely difficult squat variation, but if you're relatively fit and looking for a challenge, the pistol squat could be an effective full-body exercise for you.from standing, extend your left leg out in front of you with your knee straight. reach your arms out straight over your left leg to help you balance. lower into a deep squat with your right leg, going as low as you can without your left leg touching the floor. press back up to stand to

makeup. get a facial, paint your nails, get a pedicure, or get your eyebrows waxed. he won't know that you've gotten your hair cut or started wearing a different shade of lip gloss, but he will notice that something is different and pleasing. this helps catch his attention, even if he's not sure what exactly has changed., this is one of the most important tips for attracting a guy. sexiness isn't necessarily how you dress or how pretty you may or may not be. confidence is sexy and attractive. whenever you're around him, dress in clothes that make you feel great, and then project confidence. this confidence will read as sexiness. that is more helpful than the tightest outfit or perfect hair.it is especially important to be confident when you are around him and his girlfriend. don't let the fact that he's not with you destroy your confidence. instead, hold your head up high and show him what he's missing. if the girlfriend sees him staring at you, it might cause some problems with

him catch you staring at him. don't be overt or creepy; be coy. smile shyly at him before glancing away quickly. this helps him notice you. you want him to start thinking about you. after a few days of doing this, stop. you want to keep playing coy and be hard to get. make him miss your stares and your smiles.find reasons to walk by his desk. think of a reason to call him. do these things

utilized by you. call your insurance agency to make sure. if you allow additional drivers who are not on your personal auto policy, you run the risk that if those persons are operating the rental, they, and the damages they cause, will not be covered. ask your insurance company about this. if your policy provides minimum coverage, you may need to compute the value of the loss or damage of a newer vehicle (the rental car) and decide if you need to supplement your coverage. personal auto policies that extend collision coverage to a rental car may only provide a coverage limit equal to the value of your own vehicle. if the value of your personal vehicle is less than that of the rental vehicle, you could still incur some damage responsibility.; , some credit card companies offer rental car insurance coverage if you use their card to pay for the rental. ask about the requirements for getting reimbursed. for example, you may not be reimbursed if you don't notify the credit card company within a certain period of time (e.g. 45 days) after the incident.typically, for credit card insurance to work, the rental car has to be paid in full with that credit card, and you must decline the rental company's collision waiver, and be the primary renter of the car (although additional authorized drivers are also covered)., long-term rentals - coverage may be limited.most credit

liens placed against you for bodily injury damage. there are a few plans that most states are required by law to offer: collision damage waiver (cdw), also known as \"optional vehicle protection\" or \"loss damage waiver\" (ldw). loss damage waiver means that if the car is damaged for any reason, you can just walk away without any liability. this is true even if your own personal auto policy carries over. this gets you out of paying the deductible that you would normally have to pay under your own car insurance policy, unless the waiver itself has a deductible. costs up to $19/day shifts liability for collision damage from you to the car rental company covers for \"loss of use\". loss of use is a fee that is charged by the rental company if your rental car is damaged and is sent out

its significance.for example, you can write something like, “jaxon, thanks for working late all last week. we’ve closed the quarter with the most sales ever, thanks to you.” you have to be sincere.accordingly, you shouldn’t write a thank-you note unless you really have a reason to thank them. write out thank-you notes ahead of time. for example, write “kevin, i want to thank you for” and then leave the rest blank. when you think of something, you can fill in the rest of the sentence. by writing notes like this ahead of time, you’ll be on the lookout for excellent performance to reward. , the gift doesn’t need to be large. in fact, it should be proportional to the accomplishment you are rewarding. if someone stayed late on friday afternoon, you can give them a small gift costing no more than $10. however, someone who increased your department’s sales by 50% should be given a much larger reward, in addition to a bonus. try to find out what your employee likes ahead of time. generic gifts are okay, but it’s better to give them something you know they’ll appreciate.for example, where do they get coffee in the morning? you can get them a $20 gift card to the coffee shop. , if you don’t know what to give someone for a gift, then take them out to lunch and pick up the tab.this is a great gift because you can get to know your employee by asking them questions about their life. be honest with yourself. if you aren’t that interested in talking to your employees, then don’t take them to lunch, which could be awkward. your employee will pick up on the vibe that you aren’t really interested in talking to them. however, to facilitate conversation, you can have them choose a coworker to come along. , you might be at a meeting with other department heads when one of

angry customer generally just wants someone to vent their anger to and today, you are that person. that means that you need to do your best to listen carefully to what they are saying. give the customer your undivided attention--do not look around, space out or let other things distract you. look at the speaker and really listen to what they are saying.when you listen to them, listen for the answers to these questions: what happened to make them upset? what do they want? what can you do to help? , if the customer is particularly angry, he or she may say something (or several things) that are really rude. keep in mind that you should not take it personally--he or she is upset with the business, the product, or the service they have been provided with--they are not upset with you as a person. you will have to set your personal feelings aside. keep in mind though, that if the customer becomes too abusive, or seems really threatening, you should tell them that you will go get your supervisor or someone else to help you resolve this problem. when you are walking back to the customer, fill your supervisor or helper in on the situation and explain why you felt you needed to come get them (ie. you felt really threatened, etc.) if worse comes to worse, you will have to ask the customer to leave. know your organizations policy on when to call the authorities and how to document any encounter like this where noting specific details might be necessary for follow up. , once the customer is done venting, make sure you know exactly what it is they are upset about. if you are still feeling a little unclear, repeat what you think the customer is upset about, or ask him questions. repeating the problem back to the customer will show him that you were listening, and will also let you confirm the problem that needs to be fixed.a good way to make sure that you know exactly what the problem is, is to use calm and collected wording like “i understand that you are upset, and rightly so, that the pizza was delivered an hour late to your house.” , showing empathy will help make the customer understand that you really are trying to help them. once you have confirmed what the problem is, show them that you feel really bad about it, and completely understand why they are upset. say something like:", "have a thorough eye exam with an ophthalmologist that specializes in laser vision surgery. the eye doctor will assess your eyes, making sure that you do not have any diseases of the eye or eye conditions that could impact the surgery.before picking an eye doctor, do some research, either online or among people you know, on ophthalmologists that do laser surgery in your area. you want a doctor that is well respected and known for reliable work. don't pick the cheapest ophthalmologist just to save a few dollars, however, make sure that you are not paying an excessive amount to get a thorough and professional surgery.; , you will need to discuss the ophthalmologist's findings to find out if you have any eye conditions that will prevent you from having your vision corrected with surgery. conditions that could impact your ability to have laser vision surgery include thin corneas, glaucoma, herpes of the eye, large corneas, or inflammation of the eyelids. if your doctor says that you can't have the surgery, it means that they do not feel confident that they can complete the surgery successfully. for example, if you have thin corneas, the doctor may say they cannot do the surgery because they need the cornea to be thick enough to withstand the laser reshaping done in laser eye surgery. in this case, if your cornea is too thin and the doctor tries to reshape it, it could result in blindness. having one or more of these conditions doesn't automatically mean that you can't have the procedure, but it may mean that one type of procedure may be better than another. if your vision prescription has changed in the last year, you shouldn't get the procedure done. this means that no one under 18 should get this surgery, as younger people's vision is likely to continue changing. tell your doctor if you have had any eye diseases or procedures in the past. this could impact their assessment. , in order to get laser surgery you will need to be in good general health. this includes having no eye problems or eye injuries that you are currently recovering from.you should also avoid getting laser eye surgery if you’re pregnant or nursing. if you are taking medications that could impact your healing, such as retinoic acid and steroids, then you should wait to have the surgery. , even if the surgery can be performed on your eyes, that doesn't mean that now is the right time for it. for example, you may have commitments or job requirements that could be negatively impacted by side effects from surgery. think about your life and lifestyle and how this surgery could impact them.in general, the recovery time for laser eye surgery is very quick. you should be able to see clearly almost immediately, as long as things go as expected. however, if there are any complications, it could impact your ability to see clearly, which means that could impact your ability to work for a few days. , in order to assess whether you should get", ", if your laptop has a removable battery, it may need to be reseated. take the battery out for a few seconds, then

skip this step. if you’re using a laptop, make sure it’s plugged in. if the screen still doesn’t activate, the computer will need to be repaired by an apple authorized dealer. if using a desktop, make sure the monitor is plugged in and turned on. try a different monitor or different monitor cable. if the monitor is connected to the computer with two “chained” video adapters, try plugging in each adapter separately. , if you hear beeping instead of the chime, there’s a hardware issue. if you hear silence, skip this step. a single beep that repeats every 5 second indicates missing or improperly connected ram. if you recently installed ram, make sure it was the right kind. also, remove the new ram and then plug it back in. see how to upgrade ram on a macbook pro, how to install ram in a mac mini, or how to install ram in an imac. three beeps followed by a 5 second pause indicates that the ram installed is faulty and should be replaced. three long beeps, three short beeps, then three long

plugged in, try connecting an electric device you know works (a lamp, clock, etc.) to verify that the outlet is working. , if the outlet is working, the issue may have something to do with the power adapter or cable. if you’re using a laptop, make sure you’re using the correct type of power adapter. check with apple support to verify which type of adapter should be used with your laptop.if you’re using a desktop, the power cable is a standard universal computer power cord. you can buy them at any electronics store or borrow one from a friend. , press and hold the power button for 10 seconds.

is required to purify the body through washing before praying and performing salah, or handling and reading the qur’an. purification of the body and clothes before prayer is called taharah.; , usually water is required to cleanse one’s body before performing salah. this kind of washing ritual is called wudu, which requires that you clean your hands, forearms, face, head, and feet.there is a more intense cleansing called ghusl that is required after instances of “uncleanliness” (such as sexual intercourse, menstruation, and child birth). ghusl involves bathing the entire body.wudu is nullified after any natural discharge (urine, gas, stool, ejaculation), after falling asleep, or after any type of unconsciousness. if one of these things has happened to you, you must perform wudu again before you engage in salah., tayammum is permitted in the following instances: when acceptable water is not available within a one mile radius. when there is a legitimate fear that an enemy or a dangerous animal is near the water. when using your water for wudu would risk not having enough water to drink later. when there is no means of getting water out of the well (no rope or bucket to draw the water). when using water would be dangerous to your health. when you don’t have enough money to purchase water that is being sold. when water is being sold at an unreasonable price. when there is no trace of water and no person to ask about where to find water. , if you cannot find enough water to perform wudu, or if using the water you have would endanger your health or that of your dependents, it is appropriate to perform tayammum instead of wudu.permitted types of water include fresh water from a pond or well, melted snow, well water, or river/sea/spring water.prohibited kinds of water include unclean water, water whose color has changed, water into which something impure has fallen, water extracted from fruit and trees, water left over after animals have been drinking it, or water

checking accounts in order to manage their money effectively. checking accounts allow you to access your funds easily and use checks and debit cards instead of cash.; , regular checking accounts pay no interest at all; they are meant only to fund your checks and debit-card expenditures. interest-bearing checking accounts do offer some interest on your deposits. there are two basic kinds of interest-bearing checking accounts: regular interest-bearing checking accounts pay a minimal interest rate. if you leave funds in such an account for very long, you are likely to lose considerable purchasing power – this money would usually yield more interest in a savings, money market, or certificate of deposit account. high-interest checking accounts pay a little more. they provide an above-average interest income for your money. however, this increase in interest may be offset by fees, and you typically have to keep a much higher balance to qualify. , you can add cash and checks to your account at any time without restriction. simply fill out a deposit slip and deposit the funds into a designated atm or in person at the bank. note that if you deposit checks into your account, your bank may hold the funds (or part of the funds) until the checks clear. check with your bank to be sure. , since the ability to write checks is a key component of having a checking account, it’s important to know how to fill them out correctly. all checks have designated spaces for the following information: date. this is self explanatory: fill in the current date. pay to the order of. on this line, write the name of the check’s recipient – it can be a person or a company. $ amount. use numerals here. write the number on the left most part of the field, taking care not to leave any space – these minimizes the risk of people fraudulently writing additional numbers. dollars. write the corresponding amount, this time using words. start at the left side, and write any cents as a fraction – the number of cents over 100. if there is extra space, draw a line straight through to the end of the field. signature. sign your name here. memo. this field is optional. if desired, write a note to indicate what the check is for. if you are paying a bill, this is a good place to include your account number. , every month, you will receive a statement, noting in detail each check you wrote, all funds removed or deposited at an atm or in the bank, all debit card transactions, and any other pertinent changes to your account. the statement will also have your current balance. get in the habit of looking over your monthly statements carefully and comparing them to your own records. errors sometimes occur. checking account statements are often available by email instead of on

vague and are the symptoms of many other illnesses. this is because lymphosarcoma can affect a variety of organs, so the symptoms can vary quite a bit.however, symptoms to look out for include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss. a good example of how general the symptoms are is diarrhea, which can signal a variety of illnesses. the vagueness of symptoms is why it's important to pay attention to your cat's general healthy and to get your cat checked by a vet, who can perform a clinical examination and draw up a list of possible causes. also, the symptoms will vary depending on what type of lymphoma the cat has.when the lymphocytes flood different areas and organs, the results differ greatly. most affected cats fall into the 10-12 year old age bracket, but others occur outside this range.this means that if your cat is having these general symptoms of illness, and it is also old, the likelihood that the symptoms are caused by lymphosarcoma are greater.; , enlarged lymph nodes are a symptom of lymphosarcoma. the nodes become swollen and easy to feel. these exist in pairs (one gland on the left and one of the right of the body) in a mirror image of each other.the easiest to feel are the submandibular (in the angle of the jaw) prescapular (in front of the shoulder blades) axillary (in the armpit) inguinal (in the groin) and popliteal (behind the knee). these glands are usually not easy to find and unless you are a trained veterinary professional. they can vary in size from a small quail's eggs to golf ball sized. , make sure that it stays relatively steady. weight loss is one symptom of lymphosarcoma, although it can signal a variety of illnesses. this is because the cat loses its appetite as a result of feeling unwell, not because of the specific disease.even if your cat has lost its appetite, it may have an increased thirst. cancer can change levels of certain minerals in the blood stream, which can cause the cat to be thirsty. , this can arise in any form of lymphosarcoma, but most commonly with lymphoma in the gut. this is due to the fact that the gut has a reduced ability to absorb the nutrition from food.the vomiting and diarrhea associated with lymphosarcoma is the same as vomiting and diarrhea associated with a wide variety of illnesses. because of this, get your cat looked at by a veterinary professional if it has these symptoms. the cat could have a simple intestinal bug or may be very ill and your veterinarian is the best person to assess this. , assess whether your cat is acting normally or whether it is acting strangely. decreased activity, such as the cat being lethargic, lacking energy, and seeming unwell, can be a symptom of lymphosarcoma.this can also show itself through lack of grooming activity, so the cat's coat becomes dull looking and unkempt. , lymphosarcoma can get into the lungs and make it very difficult for a", "if you want to meet new people without being creepy, the first thing you have to do is stop worrying about how you come off and to enjoy the present moment of the new conversation. let go of your expectations, ego, and fears, all of which can prevent a conversation from unfolding organically. learn to focus on the other person so that you can drown out your inner nag and stop being distracted from interesting points of discussion and exploration. when you approach a new person, don't ask yourself, \"how do i look?\" or \"how do i sound?\" instead, ask, \"what would this person like to talk about?\" \"what matters to this person?\" you can keep the momentum going by being one step ahead of the person you're talking to by thinking about what to say next, instead of falling behind and obsessing over something you said or did five minutes ago that might have come off the wrong way.; , neediness is a precursor to obsessiveness, and obsessiveness is creepy. needy people are imbalanced and unstable because their happiness hinges too greatly on someone else. if you're projecting a vibe that you'll be devastated if a person doesn't want to be your friend or romantic partner, it's time to slow down, be patient, and examine yourself. if you really click with someone you meet, don't be too quick to say, \"i like you!\" or \"you're really awesome!\" unless you're getting a really positive vibe from the other person. whether you're meeting a potential friend or romantic partner, don't ask for the person's number in the middle or the conversation or as soon as you think you click. instead, wait until the end to ask -- it's a more natural time to ask. if you meet someone who you think will be a great friend, you can casually say, \"we should check out that new movie together,\" or \"i'd love to check out that yoga class you're talking about\" -- don't invite the person to do anything too intense at first. don't ask the person to go out on a long hike with you, go to a family dinner with you, or to help you go underwear shopping. keep it casual at first, or you'll look too eager. avoid sounding creepy or desperate by not saying things like, \"i don't have many friends -- it would be great to hang out with you!\" , you may be doubting yourself, but you'll be much more likely to come off as not creepy if you keep up your confidence and make other people feel that you're a person who is worth talking to. you should be confident before you walk into a room with new people in it and build your confidence as the conversation goes along. just smile, talk about the things that you love, and show everyone that you love who you are, where you are, and what you do. body language can help you stay confident. stand tall, maintain eye contact, and don't fidget with your hands or look at the", "organic chemistry is all about learning chemical structures and reactions. there is also a lot of vocabulary that is specific to the subject. it is very difficult to understand the material if you don’t know what all of the words mean. use flash cards to help you learn the vocabulary.once you have mastered the vocabulary, make new flashcards for reactions and structures. , study groups are a great way to check your understanding and gain new insight into the material. when explaining a concept to others, you may realize that there is something you were missing. this can lead to a deeper understanding of the material itself. at the same time, other members of the group can help you learn concepts that are difficult for you.choose study partners that learn at the same rate you do. if the group is too fast or too slow for you, it won’t be as beneficial. , when using a pencil, it is easy to just write everything down, erase, and then keep writing more. when you use a pen, you have to think through the material critically before writing anything down to avoid having to scribble things out.while this may not work for everyone, it is good to try it out and see if it helps you think ideas through properly before writing them down. , studying for an hour or two each day is a much better use of your time than trying to study for 5+ hours all at once. with smaller, more frequent study sessions, you can focus on individual concepts and not burn yourself out trying to cram all of the information into your brain at once.break up your studying into large and small blocks of time. if you only have ten minutes, flip through some flashcards. if you have an hour or two, do practice problems. , this may seem obvious, but a lot of effort put into learning material is just about showing up to class. paying attention in class and taking relevant notes is also necessary. be strategic about note-taking. don’t take notes just to take notes. listen to what the professor is saying and then summarize the information in your notes.if something you wrote during class doesn’t make sense, attend office hours to ask for clarification. , the key to success when studying any subject is to maintain your health.getting the proper amount of sleep, exercising a few times a week, and keeping a nutritious diet are all necessary to keeping yourself healthy and ready for work. doing these three things will help keep your energy up and help you maintain the information that you are learning. try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night. make time for exercise, even if it’s just a walk with a friend. make an effort to eat more fruits and vegetables and stay away from sodas and excess caffeine. , choose a study space that works best for you. do you get more done when there’s absolute silence or when there’s a little bit of background noise? a", "as difficult as it may be, leave your blisters alone and avoid scratching. they will crust over and then fall off on their own. if you scratch them, they will open up and become more susceptible to infection. you will also spread bacteria with your hands if you scratch at the blisters. if this does happen inadvertently, always wash your hands afterward to stay hygienic.; , baking soda has a ph greater than 7 (making it alkaline), giving it the ability to neutralize the chemical that creates the itching sensation. the chemical creating the itching sensation is acidic with a ph that is less than 7.apply a paste made of 3 teaspoons baking soda mixed with 1 teaspoon of water. this relieves itching and helps the blisters dry out quicker. you can apply this paste as often as needed to relieve the itching. , use a cool, moist compress to ease discomfort. you can apply this compress for up to 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. you can make a cold compress by wrapping an ice block in a clean towel and pressing it against your skin. alternatively, you can use a bag of frozen vegetables. just make sure not to put it directly on your skin and not to keep it on your skin for more than 20 minutes at a time as both of these conditions can lead to tissue damage. , apply a topical cream, such as nonprescription benzocaine cream, directly after your cool compress application. benzocaine works as an anesthetic, numbing the nerve endings in the skin., infected sores are bad news, so if you think that your sores may be infected, you should contact your doctor immediately. signs that your sores are infected include:a fever an increase in inflammation that causes additional pain the sore feels warm to the touch the sore is shiny and smooth your symptoms are getting worse , you can soak any infected sores in burow’s solution (commercial name, domeboro) or tap water. this helps to decrease oozing, clean away any crusting and soothe the skin.burow’s solution has antibacterial and astringent properties. you can purchase it without a prescription at your local pharmacy. instead of soaking your sores, you can also apply the burow’s solution directly onto your sores via the cold compress. you can apply the compress for up to 20 minutes, several times a day. , once a lesion has crusted over, you can apply capsaicin cream (e.g. zostrix) to it. you can apply the capsaicin cream up to 5 times a day in order to promote healing. , after the blisters have healed, you can apply a 5% lidocaine patch to your skin to reduce nerve pain. the lidocaine patch provides effective pain relief without the risk of negative side effects these are available at most pharmacies and online. stronger patches may be available through your doctor. , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (nsaids) are often prescribed in addition to other narcotic medications in order to boost pain

complete it, be sure to inform your former employer of your success. this shows maturity and growth. , apologize to your previous employer and boss letting them know you regret your decision. that your attitude has changed and you have realized your mistake. if there were hard feelings, ask your employer to forgive your bad behavior and reassure them that you have changed. if they hire your

and submit your résumé or vitae to your previous employer even if they are not hiring. you may decide to use your internal contacts to forward your résumé or vitae to the right person. when you submit your updated materials, do so widely. give them to the hiring personnel as well as your former boss. you may want to let other managers you were on good terms with know you are looking for work again. this way you follow the proper procedures by filing with the hiring people and you can get others interested in hiring you. , the goal here is to show you are reliable. even if you were not reliable in the past you can highlight your past mistakes and how you have resolved them. you are more reliable now than before because you resolved your issues. , your boss or employer may be amicable to your return pending some sort of penance. they may accept you back at lower pay or in a different, less desirable position. if you want your job back, accept their conditions but emphasize you want your

which hair salons are local to you. it's worth trying local salons first, for if you find one you love that is close to you, it removes the stress of having to add travel as a consideration whenever visiting the salon. it won't always work out but it's worth at least looking. go to your local shopping mall or plaza, and check out what kind of salons they have there. don't presume that just because a hair salon has a fancy central business district street address that it must be automatically the best place to go to. sometimes such a place can be snooty and overpriced while the local one might be spot on in affordable pricing and filled with lovely and caring stylists. , look at the prices of the various services, and compare them with the prices of some of the other salons that you have been to. consider your own determination of what is reasonable by way of prices in the salon. if you don't think they're reasonable, then that salon won't work for you at all. on the other hand, if they are reasonable, you can try the place out. ask about special deals and customer loyalty programs. many good stylists will offer some sort of regular customer deal that can end up with free treatments, haircuts or styling if you attend regularly over a period of time. , take a look at the presentation of the place. the whole place should be clean and tidy. notice how the brushes and combs are kept clean. look at the bench tops and floor to determine how often these are wiped and swept. check the neatness and cleanliness of the staff aprons. see how clean the sinks are. , as soon as you walk in, there should be a staff at the reception. do they greet you warmly? is someone available to assist you fairly quickly? or, are you made to wait a long time or rudely waved to sit down until someone is free? each of the ways in which you're treated upon arriving is an indication of how the salon is run as a whole and provides you with notice of what to expect by way of service. how comfortable does the place make you feel upon entering? trust that initial reaction. , the staff should be respectful and present themselves smartly. this counts for uniform (not scruffy) and personality. they should meet the standards of professionalism, should be friendly, and nice to talk to. , a hair salon should use professional products only (that means not products you'd find in the pharmacy). the products should be new, clean (not dusty) and obviously getting a good turnover. check the prices as well; are you going to be able to afford the products if you want them? , study the quality of customers' hair as soon as they walk out the hair salon. don't judge", "deciding to get treatment may feel like giving up or admitting defeat. that is an unhealthy way of thinking about your treatment. bipolar treatment is very effective and can make your life better. untreated bipolar is dangerous and can lead to destructive behavior.be honest with yourself about your bipolar, your symptoms, and your actions. you may be productive in manic phases, but make a list of the negatives. have you had relationship problems? participated in unsafe or risky behaviors? gotten into debt? left untreated, bipolar can have a negative effect on your life. , one way to fully accept your diagnosis is to commit yourself to following your treatment. this means you go to your doctor’s appointments, you take your medication, and you make the appropriate lifestyle changes.it is important to continue your treatment even if you start to feel better. only going halfway with your treatment is telling yourself you don’t need help because there’s nothing wrong with you. , when you are searching for a doctor to treat your bipolar, you should find one who specializes in bipolar disorder. not all psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists have experience treating the same thing. when you go to the doctor, ask them about their experience treating bipolar disorder.when you are searching for psychiatrists online or through your insurance company, you can usually find a list of the psychiatrist’s specializations in the info section. if you are unsure, contact the psychiatrist’s office to find out. ask your general practitioner for a referral for a good clinic. you may have a treatment team that includes a doctor or psychiatrist who handles your medication and a therapist, psychologist, or licensed social worker who oversees your therapy. , treatment for bipolar generally combines medication with therapy. not everyone responds to medication the same way, so you may try a few different types of medications before choosing the right one for you. discuss your medication options with your doctor.the medications prescribed for bipolar disorder are mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants. the aim of medication is to stabilize your moods., psychotherapy is a common treatment for bipolar disorder. often, you will receive cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt). in cognitive behavioral therapy, you work on replacing negative thought patterns with healthier ones. for bipolar, you and your therapist work on identifying and avoiding triggers, problem solving skills, and managing your symptoms.another common therapy for bipolar is interpersonal and social rhythm therapy. interpersonal therapy works on helping you improve your relationships. improving relationships can help reduce stress, which is a big trigger for bipolar. social rhythm therapy works on getting your daily routine normalized by helping you adopt better sleeping, eating, and exercising schedules. , certain lifestyle changes can help you manage your bipolar disorder. you should get on a regular sleep schedule. getting enough rest helps keep your mood level. regular exercising also helps with your symptoms. exercise is a natural mood booster and can help you feel better.work on stress relieving techniques. this may include yoga, tai chi, exercise,

outside without overcooking the inside. the best thickness for filet mignon is anywhere from 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) thick.that may seem like a very thick cut, but remember that the steak will shrink a bit as it cooks. go to your local butcher and ask him to cut the filet from the tenderloin. this ensures both a fresher cut and the ability to specify how thick you want your filet to be. oh, and you get to support your local butcher instead of a supermarket conglomerate. what if you have a thin cut of filet mignon? don't fret, but adjust your cooking accordingly. instead of slow-cooking your filet, you'll need to sear it over extremely high heat for a short period of time to get a crispy outside and a juicy, medium-rare inside.; , beware of recipes that call for rubs or marinades when it comes to filet mignon. all you need is salt and pepper. using rubs or marinades on filet mignon is likely to make the meat less tasty, not more. , some cooks choose to salt the steak after cooking it, and that's perfectly acceptable. most cooks, however, salt the filet before grilling, although many of them make the mistake of salting too soon before cooking. salt at least 40 minutes to an hour before grilling. salt brings moisture out to the surface of the steak. wouldn't that be bad news for a moist, juicy steak? you ask. it is, if you don't salt far enough in advance. for the first 30 minutes of salting, moisture comes out to the surface of the steak, accumulating in small puddles. at this point, cooking the steak would be ill-advised. after 30 minutes, some of the moisture drawn out by the salt seeps back into the meat. the process is called osmosis, and it also makes for more tender meat.the longer you leave your steaks out after 40 minutes, the more of the salty water travels back into the steak, flavoring and tenderizing it. , most cooks do this while they're waiting for the salt to do its thing. meat that has come to room temperature before cooking cooks faster and more evenly.gone are the days of charred outsides and cold insides. , gas grills aren't horrible, but they don't burn hot and can impart a gasoline smell to your precious steaks. (ew.) stick to charcoal instead. funny as it might seem, using charcoal instead of gas gives you greater control over the cooking process. that's because charcoal is a really solid heat source. it burns hot — much hotter than gas — and burns steadily. if you know how to master charcoal, it gives you a better final product. briquettes are fine, but they're nothing special. many of them have unwanted additives that give off a faint aroma, so if used, they should be white all over before you start grilling.lump charcoal", "fill the jar with hot, soapy water and allow it to soak for at least five minutes. scrub the inside and outside of the jar with a clean sponge or washcloth and rinse with hot water. choose a jar made of glass or food-grade plastic. metal and plastic jars that are not food-grade may shed potentially harmful chemicals into the juice as it ferments. the jar must be at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) tall by 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter. the average noni fruit is about 4 to 5 inches tall (10 to 13 centimeters).; , ripe noni fruit is a honey-yellow color. it is important that you pick the fruit before it turns completely white. if picking noni fruits by hand instead of purchasing them, remove the fruit carefully to avoid snapping the thin branches of the plant. , rinse the noni fruit under running water to remove any dirt. place them in the sun and allow the fruit to dry for several hours. after several hours pass, the flesh will appear soft and translucent. the fruit will also begin to take on a foul odor. this is the stage you want the noni fruit to reach before fermenting. , fix the lid firmly onto the container, but do not take any additional measures to make the jar airtight. allowing air to flow into the container openly can lead to contamination, making the lid necessary. gases build up during the fermentation process, however. if you do not have a big enough jar, they can create a dangerous amount of pressure, but many of these gases may be able to force themselves out through the small gap that exists between the lid and container. , place the jar outside, preferably in a sunny location. during this time, the juice will seep out of the fruit naturally. it is initially a light amber color, but it will darken as the weeks pass. , juice is not the only thing to develop as the juice ferments. pulp and other debris will also be mixed into the juice and must be filtered out. pour the juice through a wire mesh strainer with small gaps and into a second sterilized jar. the juice should pour through relatively easily and should not need much, if any, assistance to flow through the mesh. you can also use silkscreen, paint strainers, or cheesecloth to make sure that as much sediment as possible is separated from the noni juice. , you can drink unpasteurized juice, but pasteurized juice lasts longer and is safer to drink. place the open jar of noni juice into a pot of boiling water. the water level should cover that of the juice, but it should not be so high that it threatens to enter the mouth of the jar. once the temperature of the juice reaches 180 degrees fahrenheit (82.2 degrees celsius), allow the juice to boil for 30 minutes before removing the jar from the water. , use litmus paper to check the ph of the juice. properly fermented juice should have", "creating movies in moviestarplanet is

arrest. government websites are kept up-to-date, which makes them a reliable way to get information.all federal government websites end in .gov, while those for states can end in either .gov or .us. look for the \"legal\" or \"health and safety\" sections to see if they offer a warrant search. alternatively, try entering a phrase such as \"arrest warrant\" in the search bar on the website's home page. some counties do not offer online warrant searches. in that case, look at the local sheriff or police department site for contact information.; , if you would like to speak to someone, you can call the court directly. you can call any court in the state that you believe the warrant may be in, because states maintain a warrant database that can be accessed from any state court. do not identify yourself; instead, simply ask if there is an outstanding warrant for \"person x\" (using your name here) in a criminal or civil case. have the following information ready: the case number (if you know it), name, birth date, and social security number.the court clerk of one circuit may not be able to give you information if you have an arrest warrant from a different circuit court. keep in mind that for some cases such as family and juvenile delinquency cases, and domestic violence cases involving protective, peace, or restraining orders, you may not be able to find information through the court clerk. however, the clerk should still be able to tell you about an arrest warrant, even if he or she cannot give your specific information on the case itself. criminal cases are mostly public record, so you should not have an issue getting information on these. however, some types of civil cases are not public record, such as family and juvenile delinquency cases, and domestic violence cases involving protective, peace, or restraining orders. for these types of cases, consider consulting a bail bondsman or attorney. you can also call the county, state, or federal clerk's office. note that if you call from your own phone, the police may be able to locate and arrest you. they can trace the phone number to an address, or to any billing information associated with that phone number. if you are nervous about calling yourself, ask a close friend or family member to call for you., you can use the computers at your county court to search warrants. if you feel uncomfortable doing this yourself, ask someone to do it for you (a friend, family member, attorney, or bail bondsman). most minor offenses will not lead to an immediate arrest. you may be able to pay a fine and settle the matter quickly.be warned, however, that if there is warrant issued for you, you risk being taken into custody. , there are a number", "there is one regular extractor blade that

plug in the power base. this is the part of the nutribullet you will plug in and will place the cup onto. , use fruits and vegetables that you like to make a nutritious drink, or fill the cup with ingredients you want to turn into powder, like nuts or seeds. the tall cup nutribullet has the capacity to hold 24 ounces and the short cup has the capacity to hold 18 ounces. do not fill the cup past the max line. for nutritious drinks, add 50% fruit and 50% leafy greens. this will make a drink filled with vitamins. cut the vegetables or fruits in halves or quarters if they do not fit into the cup. fill the cup up with almonds or oats to make a powdery substance you can then eat in yogurt or on top of cereal. , the amount of liquid you use will determine the consistency of your drink, so use less liquid for a chunkier drink. never fill the cup past the fill line. you can use water, juice, almond milk, or any liquid of your choice. , once you place the ingredients of your drink or

either side of the nutribullet logo on the base. there are also two round protrusions on the cup with your ingredients; line up these notches and protrusions. then, simply push the cup down, and your ingredients will mix. lift the cup up and out to stop it. mixing the ingredients should only take a few seconds. , sometimes, ingredients will get stuck, especially if you do not put enough liquid in

a great time to ask more about the company or specific job, but you should also ask what happens next.for example, ask the hiring manager how long the post-interview process might take, if you can expect to hear from the company whether you got the job or not, and when you might hear something. you can also ask what the best way is of contacting the hiring manager if you have questions.; , if your interview goes well, you might be tempted to ask the hiring manager on the spot if you got the job. don’t do this. it can make you look desperate, which can be a turn off for the hiring manager.it’s also likely that the hiring manager won’t be able to give you an answer right away. they may have more candidates to interview, or they might need to discuss all of the candidates with a larger group of people. , this isn’t directly related to asking if you got the job, but it will keep you on the mind of the hiring manager. in your note, remind the hiring manager of who you are, what you interviewed for, and something that excites you about the company or position.for example, you can say something like “dear jim, i wanted to thank you for the opportunity to interview for the assistant manager position at jim’s bakery. i really enjoyed the interview, and i’m so excited about the new products that jim’s bakery is innovating!” don't ask for an update about the position in

hardware stores, and are not expensive. unless you plan to keep your fog machine for a long time, most of these items can be repurposed for other projects. the items you'll need include: a 2-foot, 6-inch round sheet metal ductwork pipe. this is also known as a stove pipe, and this will be the container that you make your fog inside. a 25-foot length of 1/4-inch copper refrigerator tubing a 50-foot length of 3/8-inch copper refrigerator tubing a 12-foot length of 3/8-inch clear plastic tubing a 2-foot length of 1-1/2 inch pipe (used as a form, then discarded) a 2-foot length of 3-inch abs plastic pipe (used as a form, then discarded) 4 pipe clamps for the 3/8\" clear plastic tubing 1 small submersible pump (80 gal/hour) a package of plastic wire ties an ice chest or bucket , one coil should have a diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) and the other coil should have a diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm). form the coils by tightly winding soft copper refrigerator tubing around a piece of pvc pipe. you should be able to wind the copper tubing around the pipes using your hands, but if you have difficulty grasping it, you could grab the tubing using pliers.to create the inner coil, wind the 25 foot (7.6 m) copper tubing around a 2 foot (0.61 m) (61 cm) long pipe with a diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). to create the outer coil, wind the 50 feet (15.24 m) copper tubing around a 2 foot (0.61 m) (61 cm) long pipe with a diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm). slide the coils out of their respective tubes once created. , slide the smaller coil directly inside the larger coil and secure it in place by using small wire ties. this allows the fog to pass in and around the coils, which provides the best cooling.if tying the smaller coil in place is too difficult, you can just allow the small coil to lay against the bottom of the larger one. because the coils will need to fit inside the stove pipe, stretch them out until they roughly match the length of the pipe. , slide the larger coil into your stovepipe, using wire ties to hold both coils in place. the goal is to have the two coils as close to the center as possible inside the larger pipe.hanging the coils in this way allows the fog to pass in and around the coils and cool it even better. the machine will work without using the ties, but it won't work as well. , at one end of the chiller, connect the ends of the inner and outer coils using short pieces of plastic tubing and pipe clamps.you'll need to connect the ends of the coils on the other side of the chiller to a small submersible pump using longer pieces of

adhere to. if you’re making a more casual puzzle, though, you can pick whatever size you want. if you're using an online crossword puzzle maker or puzzle-making software, you may be restricted to a certain range of available sizes. if you're making your puzzle by hand, it’s totally up to you., usually you'll select words according to a theme of your choosing.that theme, or a clue to it, can then become the title of the puzzle. examples of common themes include foreign places or languages, words from a certain time period, famous people, and sports. , this part of the process can feel as challenging as actually solving a crossword puzzle. once you've laid the words out, black out any unused squares. in a us style crossword, there should be no “hanging words,” or words that do not connect to other words. every letter should correspond to both an across word and a down word, and be totally interconnected.in a uk style crossword, hanging words are permitted. if the answer to a clue is a phrase rather than a single word, there should be no spaces between the words. you don’t need to worry about capitalizing proper nouns in your answers, as crosswords are usually filled out in all caps. the answers should not include punctuation either. many crossword puzzle creators automatically lay the words out for you. all you do is specify puzzle size and input the list of words and clues., begin in the upper-left corner of the puzzle, and divide the words by whether they run vertically or horizontally, so that you have a “1 down,” and a “1 across,” etc. this can also be pretty mind-bending, and many people prefer to use software instead of doing it all manually. if you're using a crossword puzzle creator, it will handle the numbering for you automatically., this time the starting square for each word should be numbered, but the squares themselves should be otherwise blank. if you’re creating your puzzle by hand this will be a bit more labor intensive, but if

referred to as “quick” or “straight” clues, and are generally the easiest to write and to solve. an example might be “equine mount” = horse. if you are making a crossword as an educational tool, or just don’t want to make things too complicated, you can use quick clues exclusively, but if you want to make a more challenging puzzle, you will probably want to avoid them, or use them sparingly., these generally involve some sort of metaphor, or rely on lateral thinking. an example might be “half a dance” = cha or can (taken from chacha or cancan). crossword creators often indicate this type of clue by beginning with “maybe”", "some hair dye manufacturers already have products made especially for \"at home\" lowlights. pick this if it is available. if not, choose your color carefully

your hair the day you plan on dyeing it. the natural oils your hair develops when it remains unwashed help to bind the dye to your hair. these oils also help your dye last longer. avoid conditioning your hair the day before you dye it. conditioners disrupt the natural oils your hair produces. , as you may have guessed, dye can really mess up a shirt, rug, or anything else it might get on besides your hair. in order to protect against dye stains, cover the ground where you will be dyeing your hair, as well as any nearby surfaces, with newspaper. you should wear an old t-shirt that you don’t mind getting stained.it is a good idea to have paper towels nearby, just in case there is a dye spill. , place an old towel that you don’t mind staining around your shoulders. put latex or rubber gloves on before you mix the dye so that you don’t ruin that cute manicure you just got.most dyeing kits come with gloves to use during the dyeing process. if your box doesn’t, you can purchase latex and rubber gloves at your local drugstore. , in order to do this, you will need to rub vaseline along your hairline, neck, and over your ears. vaseline helps wash away the dye after you have finished dyeing your hair. some dye boxes come with a conditioner made specifically for protecting your skin from the dye. if your dye comes with this, use it. you can also use lip balm instead of vaseline,

shape, and color sapphire you’re looking for. if you are looking for an engagement or wedding ring, make sure you have a set budget before you go shopping. if you establish a budget prior to shopping,

sapphires are priced based on color, cut, clarity, and carat size. the first measure for pricing a sapphire is its color. lighter blue sapphires with violet or purple undertones will likely be priced the highest—around $1,000usd for a single carat stone.sapphires come in many different colors, but each color will be accompanied by a different value and price. sapphire value is based on the basic color of the gem as well as any secondary hues and tones that appear when light hits the stone. for example, a yellow sapphire that has green or gray undertones is less valuable than a yellow sapphire that is more pure, with white undertones, or flashes.look for any brown or gray hues in the stone. these types of tones diminish the value of the gem. you want a sapphire that has a deep, rich saturation of one color., sapphires traditionally come in a cushion, an oval, or rounded shape. there are a variety of other less common shapes, but you are most likely to find sapphires cut into these specific shapes while shopping.pick a sapphire that has a cut that best shows off the luster and shine of the stone. a good cut will enhance these qualities, and appear more brilliant when it catches the light.the table of the stone, which is the flat surface across the top, should be level and smooth, and there should not be any dull areas on the stone when it moves and catches light. , with sapphires, unlike other precious stones like diamonds, you can check the clarity with the naked eye. if you can look at the sapphire and confirm that there are no dark spots or discrepancies in the stone, it it likely very valuable.because of the environment in which sapphires form, some “inclusions” or tiny specks from other minerals, are a normal occurrence. it’s the deep color of

positive attitude when you broke your arm in a car accident that wasn't your fault, or when you've been rejected by the last five girls you've dated. it's a tough situation-- but that doesn't mean it's impossible. your ability to be optimistic and to see your setbacks as isolated incidents instead of indicators of your future success is precisely what will make you succeed in the future. tell yourself that just your positive attitude alone has the ability to help you seize more opportunities, be creative about ways to improve your life, and to feel more fulfilled overall. find a way to nip your negative thoughts in the bud. any time you notice that you think or feel something negative, try to think of three positive thoughts to fight those negative ones. you know what will go a long way

you have done in your life.you may begin to see just how resilient and accomplished you already are. , one major aspect of being more resilient is learning to deal with and accept change.studies show that if you view the changes in your life as challenges instead of threats, you will be much more equipped to deal with them. learning to adapt to new situations, whether it's moving to a new place or becoming a new parent, is a survival skill that will help you find creative solutions to new problems and to face adversity with relative calm and ease.work on being open-minded. avoid judging people for how they look, what they do, or what they believe. not only will this help you learn something new, but being aware of a variety of perspectives can help you see the world in a new way if you're forced into an unfamiliar situation. a way to get better at embracing change is to always be trying new things, whether you're making new friends, picking up a new painting class, or reading a new genre of books. keeping things fresh can make you less resistant to change. view change as an opportunity to grow, adapt, and transform.change is necessary and good. tell yourself, \"i accept this

with one other person, is often silent and in some cases even moving can compromise your position and put you and your team at risk. it is essential to stay calm as a sniper, whether its during movement to or from an objective, while waiting to conduct reconnaissance, or in the face of the enemy.keeping a cool head will allow you to properly utilize your training and expertise to handle the situation at hand. there are many stories of snipers being surrounded by enemies in combat situations that survived because of their ability to remain calm and concealed as the enemy passed. , with all the waiting around one is apt to do as a sniper, it can be easy to lose sight of what you’re there to be doing. after three days of seeing nothing, your mind may begin to wander instead of remaining focused on your objective. combat this loss of focus by frequently reminding yourself of your objectives and how important it is to your team’s safety that you stay attentive.getting too comfortable and allowing your mind to drift is a form of complacency. complacency kills in a combat zone, as you must always be aware of your surroundings. mission accomplishment is, and should always be, the number one priority of a sniper. , although there may be hours of waiting around, being a sniper also means moments of extreme physical stress. because of this, physical fitness is paramount for a sniper. covering ground quickly to put you and your team in a better position to achieve your objectives, or to get to an extraction point means having the cardiovascular strength to run quickly for extended periods of time. carrying all of the gear necessary for your mission will also require physical strength. developing a strong body will help you to adjust to stressful combat situations, recover from injuries, and aid team members if they are injured.snipers must be among the most physically fit combatants on the battlefield. incorporate a good deal of running and some weight training into your workout regimen as a sniper. , being a sniper in a combat zone will likely mean having to make the decision to end a life. there is no universal strategy for coping with this choice, or the feelings that may arise as a result. however, distancing yourself from your target emotionally can help to lessen the emotional repercussions of killing another person in defense of your country.chris kyle, a highly decorated navy sniper, often taught people to focus on the lives they were saving by engaging the enemy, rather than on the lives of the enemy that they were taking. although you may spend a significant amount of time observing your target, it’s important not to allow yourself to become attached to them. , being a sniper means long periods of inaction followed by infrequent and

the colored bubbles. bubbles are cleared when you hit your bubbles to the same-colored bubbles at the top., the bubbles you shoot follow the path indicated by the dotted line. you will know where your bubble will land by observing the direction of the dotted line. you can also bounce the bubble off the walls to reach those hard-to-reach spaces. , if you can, go for the gaps between bubbles and aim higher. if you’re able to clear out higher bubbles, the lower bubbles attached to them will fall off and bounce towards the jars at the bottom, giving you extra points. , for each turn, you have two

compared to the objectives for it. summarize the main outcomes of the event. tailor the event report for the needs and interests of each sponsor and audience. consider the objectives of the sponsors. to some degree, sponsors are the key audience for an event report. they want to know whether it was worth sponsoring the event. so consider what they will want to know and what their hot buttons are.

executives and financial managers. , you don’t want to have to rely on your memory. tracking key information before, during, and after the event will allow for a more specific, and ultimately more effective, report. it will also allow you to compile it all in a timelier fashion. consider data collection to be continuous, using multiple people if necessary (including possible interns) to collect data. the bottom line is that you should not wait to create the report until the end of the event., one problem with some event reports is that they do little more than regurgitate the agenda or focus on feel-good, booster-ish statements. don’t do that. instead, highlight the key points with a clear, analytical eye. pick out some of the event highlights to discuss in detail. consider which three things worked best, and which three points were most surprising.avoid packing the article with mundane details, such as the luncheon menu or a detailed summary of the entire presentation of the keynote speaker. you want to pull out the things that mattered. , the event report should include an executive summary that is a concise version of the more detailed full report. think of the executive summary as being like an introduction. you could create two reports – an executive summary designed for people who have some interest in the event’s outcome, and a more detailed fuller report for people actually involved in setting up or sponsoring the event. in the executive summary, you want to boil down and focus on the key objects and results. the executive summary should be brief – just one or two pages. it should summarize the key elements delivered by the event, and it should include a brief interpretation of the data. , it’s often more effective to offer a chart illustrating statistical trends, instead of just presenting readers with a bunch of numbers. if the event included a new product, you could present a photo of it. photos of the actual event could help illustrate the event report. try to get photos of sponsors’ exposure on the site to document it for the report. again, this is a task that can’t wait until after the event. samples, reproductions, and

possesses. you can use this information to create an effective targeted resume, so pay attention – read the entire posting carefully, and note where your skills and experience match the ad. for example, a job posting for a marketing manager may state that the successful candidate must be able to create a marketing strategy for a new hotel. if you have experience developing and implementing new marketing strategies in the hospitality industry – and especially if you have this experience in relation to hotels – you should take note of that and plan to highlight that specific part of your background.; , as you read a job posting, take the time to highlight important duties associated with the job. when you begin to construct your targeted resume, you will be able to go back to the ad and quickly scan for this key information. , in addition to noting key job duties, you should also highlight or underline all required and desired qualifications, including education, skills, and experience. successful candidates will probably meet most or all of the “desired” qualifications, so these are nearly as important as “required” qualifications for creating a strategically tailored resume. note that although many job ads will list required and desired qualifications in formal sections, many will scatter them throughout the posting. be sure to read the entire ad. , in addition to the qualifications listed specifically in the advertisement, a job may also carry implied qualifications – those that you can glean from reading other parts of the ad and thinking about the position as a whole. you should plan to include implied qualifications on your targeted resume as well. for example, a particular job posting for a marketing manager may state that a job duty is “conducting email marketing” but include nothing related to email marketing in its required or desired qualifications. you can still conclude that skills and experience in this area are desirable; these are implied qualifications that should appear on your targeted resume. , the first and most obvious place to tailor your resume is right at the top, with your heading and summary statement. start by including the name of the potential job in a heading immediately underneath your contact information. enlarge the font slightly, and put the heading in bold to separate it from the rest of the information. if you have never held a position exactly like this one, place the words “qualifications for” just above the heading. this explains to recruiters that although you do not hold an identical job and haven’t in the past, you intend to show that you are qualified. , under your new heading, list a few of your most significant skills. these should be tailored to the particular job, so think carefully about the advertisement, and decide which of your qualifications seem most crucial. separate these skills with a slash. for example, if you are applying for a marketing manager position, you might write:", "the defcon scale is a way of assigning a numerical value to the readiness of the american military. higher defcon values are used for lower levels of readiness (during more peaceful situations), while lower defcon values are used for higher levels of readiness (during tenser situations where the possibility of military action is more likely). a defcon level of 5 corresponds to ordinary peacetime, while a defcon level of 1 (which has never been reached) corresponds to the most dangerous situations, like thermonuclear war. note that different branches of the military can be issued different defcon levels. for instance, during the cuban missile crisis, which is generally considered one of the tensest moments in american military history, the strategic air command went on defcon 2, while the rest of the military went on defcon 3., a defcon level of 5 is a very good thing — this is the condition used to designate normal peacetime military readiness. at a defcon 5, the us military takes no wide-scale precautionary defense measures beyond what is ordinarily required. note that defcon 5 isn't necessarily a sign that the world is at peace — conflicts, even major ones, may be occurring around the world during a defcon 5. however, in this case, the military judges that these events pose no significant defense threats. , defcon 4 is the first level of readiness above the baseline value of defcon 5 and thus constitutes a fairly mild increase in readiness (though an increase from defcon 5 to defcon 4 is certainly significant). this defcon level signifies increased intelligence-gathering efforts and, sometimes, the heightening of national security measures. however, it is not usually an indication that the military (or the nation) are in imminent danger of attack. in the modern world, it is thought that defcon 4 is sometimes issued after minor to moderate terrorist attacks and politically-motivated killings, or after would-be plots are uncovered. presumably, this is done in anticipation of further violence as an attempt to prepare for and prevent it. , situations that call for defcon 3 are serious — though they may not pose an immediate threat to the existence or stability of the american state, they do call for significant vigilance. at this level, american military forces are put on a heightened state of alert in anticipation of mobilization — in particular, the air force is kept ready to launch operations with just 15 minutes of notice. in addition, all military communications may be encrypted based on classified protocols. historically, defcon 3 has usually corresponded to situations in which military action against the us or one of its allies was a distinct possibility. for instance, during operation paul bunyan, which resulted in a defcon 3, two american officers were killed by north korean forces in the korean demilitarized zone (dmz). in this case, a defcon 3 was issued because of the possibility that any errors in the resulting standoff might trigger open war across the korean border (a politically and militarily tense area then, as it is today)., defcon 2 refers to a further", "distress tolerance refers to how well you can handle uncomfortable, negative, or distressing emotions.think about how you react when you imagine something bad happening to your family — do you panic and frantically try to stop your feelings of fear and anxiety? do you run from the feelings or bury them? do you do something destructive? increasing your tolerance for these uncomfortable feelings can give you room to deal with them in a healthy way.in fact, the act of worrying can be a way of avoiding distressing emotions. if you're in your head, worrying about something bad that may happen to your family, you are actually distracting yourself from your emotions.your worry may be a way you distract yourself from anxiety over things you can't control.learn to self-soothe in the face of distress. when you begin to worry about your family, figure out what you can do to make the emotion more tolerable. this doesn't mean you run from the feeling, but you make it less intense so you can deal with it. try some of the following: exercise, dance, clean the house, listen to soothing music, look at artwork or something beautiful, play with your pet, do a puzzle or play a game, watch your favorite tv show, volunteer, take a shower or a bubble bath, pray, read a book, laugh, sing, go somewhere beautiful and calming.start noticing the things you do that make you feel better, and the things that make you feel worse (such as binge eating, isolating yourself in your room, etc.). , oftentimes people think worrying is productive — if you are hyper-vigilant about everything that might happen to your family, then you might be able to protect them from anything that might harm them. unfortunately, this doesn't work — this doesn't make life more predictable. instead, you just waste time and energy, as you can never know with 100% certainty what will happen in life.realize that worrying about worst-case scenarios (\"what if my dad gets cancer and dies?\" \"what if my plane crashes?\") doesn't have the power to stop these things from happening.ask yourself: is it possible to be certain about everything in life? does worrying constantly about something bad happening have any advantages? does it keep me from enjoying the present moment? can i accept that there is a small chance something bad will happen, but the actual likelihood of it happening is very low?, this means you become habituated, or grow used to, your worries. for 30 minutes you visualize what you're afraid of — your family dying in a car crash, for instance — and accept the feelings that arise instead of trying to avoid them or run away.the goal of this is to allow your anxiety to calm down and to come to a place of acceptance. it will also help you begin to distinguish between solvable problems and those over which you have no control.ask yourself these questions, suggested by helpguide.org:is the problem something i'm currently facing, rather than an imaginary what-if? if the problem is an imaginary what-if, how likely", "these monsters can be found on the specific locations of the following game versions of the legend of zelda: the legend of zelda – can be found in any dungeons within the game. a link to the past – inside the boss room of “tower of hera,” the third level of the game. four swords – inside the boss room of “tail cave,” the first level of the game. the wind waker – after defeating the “puppet ganon” boss inside the tower of ganon. it will transform into a moldorm. the minish cap – can be found anywhere inside the “fortress of wind” level. phantom hourglass – can be found anywhere inside the “temple of courage” level. skyward sword – can be found in any dungeons within the game. a link between worlds – inside the boss room of tower of hera, just like in a link to the past version. , moldorms do not have any special techniques. once these creatures spot you, they will move linearly towards you and try to ram your character. just make a short sidestep off the monster’s path to avoid its attack. , to kill moldorms, all you need to do is to strike its tail three times with your sword. after you’ve dodged its attack, you should eventually end up behind the monster, giving you full access to its defenseless tail. press the “attack” button on your controller quickly to slash at the tail. one other weapon you could use to kill moldorms aside from your sword is your bow and arrow. after dodging its ram attack, or standing from a safe distance, aim your bow at its tail and fire an arrow at it. unlike your sword, it only takes one shot of an arrow to the tail to kill moldorms. , only in the twilight princess version do moldorms take a different approach to kill. these creatures can be found swimming in the sands of the gerudo desert. once you get in the desert, you’ll see these creatures roaming around the area, just like how sharks move around the surface of the water.; , moldorms do not have any special techniques in this version either. once these creatures spot you, they will slither through the sand towards you. once they’re close enough, they’ll jump out of the sand and dive at you. just make a short sidestep off the monster’s path to avoid its attack. , you can’t kill these monsters while they are in the sands. that’s why as these monsters jump out of the sand to attack you, they’ll be exposing their defenseless bodies. press the “attack” button on your controller quickly to slash at the moldorm’s body while it’s in mid-air. it takes three hits of your sword to the tail before a moldorm can be killed. just like in other versions of the game, one other weapon you can use to kill moldorms is your bow and arrow. while the worm is in mid-air, shoot an arrow at its body to kill it. unlike your sword, it only", "great actors spend their entire careers learning to relax the muscles in their face and body at will. tension is very obvious when you are on stage. your voice will sound thin and wavering, and your movements will be jerky and unattractive. to avoid these stiff and nervous displays when you're acting, it is essential to remain as relaxed as possible. even a scene involving high drama calls for measured and calm concentration from the actor. so, act dramatic, but be calm inside, and don't work yourself up. , it could be another actor, a prop, etc. keep yourself in the moment and never stare off into space. it is obvious to the audience if you are spacing out, and it is very distracting. keeping in the moment enables you to remain in character and enhances the believability of the role and the play itself. in real life, we tend to look at the eyes of the people we're speaking with (or listening to), so doing that on stage will appear quite natural., just look at the back of the theater or your focus point if you are tense. looking into the eyes of your fellow actors can be reassuring and let you feel not so \"alone\" on stage. , forget that you are pretending, and try to become the character you are playing. envision how that person reacts to life, how that person dresses, walks, thinks and converses with others. don't be afraid to act like someone else. draw on these visualizations when portraying the character. always stay in that state of mind when acting. if you only pretend to be sad, it's an effort; if you are sad, the result is more authentic. don't act the character, be the character. , while acting, you need to enunciate your words carefully (speak clearly) and project your voice farther than normal (which is not the same thing as shouting), because there are people a good distance away who are trying to understand what you're saying. all the emotions on your face should be formed in a more intense manner (but remember to stay relaxed). if you feel like you're over-acting, then you're probably acting just enough. eyes, smile, facial expressions, gestures, etc. need to be more expansive and dramatic than you would ever make them in real life. this is often confused with exaggeration, but it really isn't. exaggeration means making your actions and speech \"bigger.\" instead, you want better. it's different if you're acting in front of a camera. here you must be more subtle, as in real life. a camera picks up subtleties very easily. broad and exaggerated movements suitable for stage acting often look \"hammed up\" on film. , if you're performing for an audience (either live or on film), do everything you can to make the audience believe the character you're portraying. if the script says that someone is talking too much, then show a look of annoyance on your face, and perhaps accompany that with impatient tapping of your foot. if you're supposed to be near tears,", "there are a variety of people that you could ask, and some may feel more comfortable than others, in terms of having the conversation.choose the person with whom you would like to have this conversation, and have a back-up person, just in case. mother older sister older female cousin grandmother aunt female teacher female guidance counselor doctor or medical professional; , if your mother is not present in your life, and you have no other women with whom you feel comfortable talking, be prepared to try to have the conversation with a male figure. you could ask your father, an uncle, your grandfather, a male teacher, or a male guidance counselor. instead of having the conversation with this male figure, you could ask him to connect you with a female he knows who would be willing to talk with you about this, like a female coworker or neighbor. , you likely have many questions, and you want to be sure to get all of them answered. compile them into a list to ask during the conversation. “how old were you when you got your first period?” “what happens during a period?” “what is a menstrual cycle?” “does having your period hurt?” “how long does a period last?” “what do i need to do to get ready for my period?” “how will i know if i might be getting my first period?” “why do girls and women get periods?” “do you know of any books or websites that i can read to get even more information?” “what does it mean when you haven't gotten your period by the 'normal age?'” “what are the differences between different feminine hygiene products?” , this is a sensitive topic for many girls and women, and it can be embarrassing and awkward to talk about getting your period. plan out when and where you will have this conversation with your chosen trusted person. it might be best to do it at a time when no one else is around or will be interrupting. perhaps you could arrange it for an evening when you know other family members will be busy out of the house. have the conversation in a place where you feel comfortable, like at home, in your guidance counselor's office, or in a doctor's office. , it is perfectly acceptable to bring up the conversation on-the-spot, but it could be helpful to pre-arrange when it will happen. ask your trusted chosen person if they have some time to chat with you after dinner, after school, or at whatever time you had in mind. in the event that you plan to have the conversation with a teacher, guidance counselor, or doctor, you will likely need to schedule an appointment. , especially if you are trying to have this conversation with someone other than a close female family member, this person may not feel comfortable or feel that it is his/her place to talk about this with you. “i'm hoping to talk with you about getting my period. do you feel comfortable having that conversation with me?” “i", "before you can figure out what zoning regulations apply to your home, you need to figure out how your particular property is zoned. while many more urban neighborhoods may have dual-zoned properties, homes in purely residential neighborhoods may have restrictions on home-based businesses.pure residential zoning tends to have the most restrictions, depending on the population density of your neighborhood and its proximity to commercial zones. many states have enacted legislation favoring home-based businesses, which often includes a broad definition of home-based businesses that qualify as \"no impact\" and therefore are exempt from any zoning restrictions. no-impact home-based businesses typically are those that add little to no additional traffic to the neighborhood, such as freelancers who rarely if ever see clients in their home.; , even if home-based businesses are permitted under zoning regulations, there may only be certain types of businesses allowed. typically when types of businesses are forbidden the purpose is to maintain the residential character of the neighborhood.certain types of home-based businesses, such as daycares, also must comply with other local ordinances such as fire and health codes. some states such as california require all local jurisdictions to allow specific types of home-based businesses such as daycares. keep in mind that although you may be permitted to have an office in your home, zoning ordinances may prohibit specific types of business activities. for example, you may have a home office but not be able to meet clients there. this still could potentially save you money as you could meet clients in a public place such as a park or coffee shop, or explore office sharing opportunities in your area. , the main reason neighborhoods fight the presence of businesses in residential areas is the increase in traffic as customers or clients travel to and from the business location.residential zoning codes typically won't allow restaurants or retail stores that potentially would have customers flowing in and out throughout the day. if you have a service-based home business, such as a law firm or an insurance company, there may be zoning restrictions that control how many clients you can see in a day, the hours you can see clients in your home office, and where they must park. your local zoning ordinance also may restrict how many employees you can have, or whether you can even have employees at all. as far as parking, zoning regulations typically prevent your clients or customers from taking spots available for residents, or clogging up the streets. you may be required to provide your own parking, for example by paving an area behind your house to accommodate the needs of your business visitors. , even if your business complies with all other rules and regulations, there may be restrictions on changes to your home's exterior or the posting of signs or other advertising that you must follow.for example, you may be prohibited from putting up any sign on the exterior of your home or in your yard that advertises your business to passersby. depending on the historic value of your home or neighborhood, any renovations you", "you want to start off with a basic primer. this lessens the appearance of makeup and fine lines. apply a layer of primer to your face using your fingers. make sure to especially target your nose, under your eyes, your forehead, and your cheekbones. ; , when applying foundation for photographs, you want to use a matte foundation. matte makeup does not reflect light, making it a better choice for photography.to start, use your fingertips to dab some foundation on your cheeks, your chin, the bridge of your nose, and your forehead. use a makeup brush to blend the makeup into your face. use large, circular motions as you move the brush throughout your face. go over your face with the makeup brush a few times to make sure the foundation looks blended and smooth. make sure to blend the foundation into your neck as well, so there is not a sharp contrast between your face and neck. never stop blending foundation at your jawline., if you're doing an outdoor shoot, you do not need as much foundation. natural light can make makeup appear more obvious and you may look overdone with too much foundation. only apply foundation to areas where your skin is uneven and discolored if you'll be shooting outdoors. , once your basic foundation is laid down, you'll need to apply some concealer. this can help eliminate the appearance of dark circles under your eyes, and can also highlight certain areas to create a slimming affect on your face. use the brush that came with your concealer. dab some concealer under your eyes. draw a line of concealer running down the bridge of your nose. then, add some to your chin and forehead. it may also be a good idea to add some concealer just above you lip. use a makeup sponge to slowly dab the concealer into your face. go slowly and keep dabbing until the concealer is blended into the rest of your makeup. , for photos, brightening powder can help make your face light up a bit more. it can also help set your makeup and keep it from fading during a photo shoot. using a large and fluffy makeup brush, dab a small amount of brightening powder on the areas where you applied concealer. , even if you don't usually contour, doing so for a photo shoot can help your face look slimmer and more defined.use a dark stick foundation to trace your face and blend the makeup from there. run the foundation from your temples to your hairline. find your cheekbone by placing your finger on your face and finding the hollow part. place a line of foundation here. you should also place two lines of foundation running along either side of the bridge of your nose. trace your jawline with foundation, and then add a dab to your chin. use a sponge to dab the makeup into your face. apply a lighter, powder-based foundation below your eyes, on your chin, and on the center of your forehead. then, use a fluff brush to", "fingerprint powder is a very fine powder that is either white or black. white powder is used to dust prints on dark surfaces, and dark powder is used if the print is left on light colored surfaces. officials use either talcum-based powders for white, or graphite-based powders for black. they also sometimes use special fluorescent powders that glow under black light, if the prints may be especially hard to dust for or are on multi-colored or multi-textured surfaces.at home, you can use either baby powder, corn starch, or cocoa powder.; , you’ll want to find a brush with very fine, very soft bristles. a makeup brush or a very small paint brush will work well. just be sure that the bristles are soft and not stiff from rinsed in water and reused., you can use scotch tape or any other clear tape like packaging tape. just don’t use duct tape or other colored painting tape. the tape is for picking up the print after it has been powdered., if you are going to use white powder, get black construction paper so the print contrasts with the paper and is easy to see when you put it down. if you’re using a dark powder (cocoa powder or black fingerprint powder), then plain white paper is fine., if you have microscope slides, these are perfect to use for putting a fingerprint on. if not, any smooth table, chair, appliance, wall, floor, doorknob, or faucet will do., if you want to make sure your print is even easier to see after dusting it, apply some lotion to your hands before pressing down. practice dusting for your own prints first, and then you can try finding ones that were left accidentally around the house., you’ll want to take just a small pinch between your thumb and forefinger and sprinkle it over the whole print, trying to get some on the whole space that you think was covered by your print. you can also blow the powder around a bit to get the print covered as well., you’ll want to be very gentle so you leave the fingerprint intact. it’s best to gently lower the brush in a circular dabbing motion than to just swipe it, because swiping may smear the print. if your print gets smeared, you may have brushed too roughly or your brush may not be soft enough. this may take some practice to get it right. you should be able to see the fingerprint clearly in the powder when you’re done., use a big enough piece that you can leave room on the corner of the tape to keep holding it (this will make it easier to pull up). then very carefully pull the tape up. when you lift the tape, the powdered print should be stuck to it. , remember, if you used white powder, use a black piece of paper to capture the print with the tape. if you used dark or black powder, use a white piece of paper., once you have practiced finding your own intentional prints, you’re ready", "the first variable you need to find for the contribution margin equation is the price the product is sold for. let's follow along with an example problem in this section. for the purposes of our example, let's say that we run a factory that manufactures baseballs. if we sell the baseballs at $3 apiece, we'll use $3 for our baseballs' price.; , besides the product's cost, the only other variable we need to find to determine its contribution margin is its total variable cost. the variable costs associated with a product are those that change with the number of products made, like wages, materials, and utilities like power, water, and so on.the more products made, the greater these costs will be — because these costs vary, they're called \"variable\" costs. for instance, in our baseball factory example, let's assume the total cost of the rubber and leather used to make the baseballs in the last month was $1500. on top of this, we paid our workers $2400 and our factory's utility bill amounted to $100, for a total of $4000 in variable costs. if the company produced 2000 baseballs in that month, then the variable cost of each baseball is (4000/2000) = $2.00. note that, in contrast to variable costs, fixed costs are those that do not change as production volume changes. for example, the rent that our company pays on its factory building will be the same no matter how many baseballs are produced. rent, therefore, represents a fixed cost. fixed costs are not included in the contribution margin calculation. other common fixed costs are buildings, machinery, patent applications, etc.utilities might fall under both fixed and variable costs. for instance, the amount of electricity used by a store during operating hours is the same whether or not a single product is sold. but in a manufacturing plant, electricity may be a variable depending on the amount of product being manufactured. determine whether or not you have any utilities that fall into the category of variable costs. , when you know the variable cost and the price of a product, you're ready to find the contribution margin by simply subtracting the variable costs from the price. your answer represents the amount of money from the sale of a single product that the company is able to use to pay fixed costs and generate profit. in our example, it's easy to find the contribution margin of each baseball. simply subtract the variable costs per ball ($2.00) from the price per ball ($3.00) to get (3 - 2) = $1.00. note that in real life, the contribution margin can be found on a business's income statement, a document companies publish for investors and the irs, a positive contribution margin is almost always a good thing - the product recoups its own variable costs and contributes (hence \"contributing\" margin) a certain amount towards the fixed costs. since the fixed costs don't increase with the amount of product produced, once they're paid off, the contributing margin from the remaining products sold becomes pure profit. in our", "if you haven't already, you need to stop doing the activity that caused the stress fracture in the first place. you should have some idea of what caused it, as it probably started hurting while you were doing it.stress fractures are caused by doing the same thing over and over again. that's why you need to not do that particular activity at the moment.for instance, you may need to stop running for a little while to help your leg heal.; , you need to rest whatever bone you fractured. that means taking a break from all regular activities for that limb, not just the activity that caused the fracture.your doctor will tell you when you can put weight on your leg again, if the fracture is in your foot or leg., elevation means putting the injured area above your heart. at the very least, it should be off the ground if it is your leg or foot. elevation helps cut down on pain and swelling.try propping the limb up with a pillow. , if you're not in a cast, which is likely, you may need to ice the injured area for the first day or two. you can apply ice up to four times a day, but make sure you don't apply it to bare skin. always have a towel or cloth between your skin and the ice pack. with your doctor's permission, you can take off your boot to apply ice to the area, if you have one.don't apply ice for more than 20 minutes at a time. , you can take acetaminophen (tylenol) or nsaids such as ibuprofen (advil, motrin) or naproxen (aleve) for pain. the choice is up to you, though they both have advantages and disadvantages.nsaids are anti-inflammatory, meaning they can help reduce swelling, which can help with an injury like a fracture.on the other hand, other studies have shown that nsaids may not be as good when you're trying to heal a bone due to their blood thinning properties, so it may be better to take acetaminophen.the american association of family physiciansrecommends acetaminophen. do not give aspirin to children. if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or bleeding, talk with your doctor before using these medicines., once you start being active again, go slowly. it's important to not start the activity that caused the fracture again right off the bat because you can re-injure yourself, causing more pain.at first, it's best to choose activities that do not put weight on your injury, such as swimming or water walking., your muscles support your bone, so they need to be strong enough to provide that support.as you heal, you need to perform stretches to lengthen the area. if you're unsure how to begin, consult with a physical therapist to learn which exercises to start with. it's best to begin slowly. also, focus on strength training exercises, such as weightlifting, to strengthen muscles in that area. again, it's important to begin slowly, starting with smaller weights and working your way up.in addition", "because of the risk of mercury poisoning if the thermometer breaks, the canadian pediatric society and american academy of pediatrics recommend using digital thermometers rather than old-fashioned mercury thermometers to ensure safety.mercury thermometers must be held as long as 3 minutes to get a reading, whereas digital readings come within seconds. for both safety and convenience, a digital thermometer is a better choice. the aap also recommends using a plastic rather than a glass thermometer to avoid the possibility of breakage and injury.; , ask your doctor which method is right for you and your child. the american academy of pediatrics recommends measuring temperatures rectally using a digital thermometer in children from newborns to 3 years old to get the most accurate reading.apply a small amount of petroleum jelly to the anus and insert the thermometer 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) into the anus.if you use a digital thermometer for rectal temperature measuring, do not use the same thermometer to take oral readings. label the thermometer to keep it separate., a temporal thermometer, or forehead scanner, uses infrared to measure how hot the temporal artery in the forehead is.these thermometers can be more expensive, however, so you may wish to use a regular oral or tympanic (in-ear) thermometer. temporal thermometers can be used in children 3 months and older., being sick can be scary and children always want to be held. cuddling your child on your lap will allow you to take his temperature more easily because he will be more calm and cooperative.breastfeeding or telling stories will calm and distract the younger child. older children can sit with their arm around you and snuggle in. , oral digital thermometers provide reliably accurate (close to rectal), easily taken temperatures without causing the child too much distress.for children younger than 3, consider taking your child's temperature rectally instead.underarm, or axillary, temperatures may be up to 2 degrees lower than rectal temperatures. this is not as reliable a method as taking a temperature orally or rectally.oral thermometer probes are to be placed under the tongue - not bitten and not clamped down with teeth - and held in place until the probe beeps or 2-3 minutes have passed. , tympanic digital thermometers are also convenient and reliable for taking a child’s temperature. they work by measuring the heat of the ear canal and tympanic membrane inside the ear.pull the ear slightly down and back to allow the ear canal to open for a better reading. insert the probe a few millimeters into the ear and pause. the tympanic reading is quick, beeps when ready, and is usually only slightly less accurate than rectal.a child with an ear infection will have a raised temperature in that ear so the thermometer should be used in the opposite ear if possible.if the ear infection is in both ears, use a different method to check your child's temperature. , every 4 hours, get a new temperature rating. record these values so you can monitor rise and fall. a normal temperature is up to 37.2c or 99f. low grade fevers", "do not use human toothpaste or toothbrushes to clean your dog’s teeth. human toothpaste contains high amounts of fluoride, which is poisonous to dogs. visit your local pet supply or pet grooming store to purchase dog toothpaste and a toothbrush. you can also make your own doggie toothpaste by mixing baking soda with water.mix a tablespoon of hot water with two tablespoons of baking soda. to add freshness to the paste, add a pinch of cinnamon to the mix.; , bring your dog to the bathroom, or an area away from noise and commotion, and close the door. also, choose a space that has good lighting so you can inspect your dog’s teeth thoroughly.bring some doggie treats with you so you can reward your dog for good behavior throughout the process. , get your dog accustomed to having its teeth brushed by massaging your dog’s lips with your finger, first. massage your dog’s lips in a circular motion for 30 to 60 seconds once per day for a week. this step is especially important if your dog has an adverse reaction to its mouth being touched. if your dog has an adverse reaction, stop what you are doing. try again after a minute. reward your dog with a treat for good behavior. , the following week, move on to touching your dog’s teeth and gums with your finger. wrap your finger in gauze. lift and hold your dog’s upper lip. gently rub your finger in a circular motion over your dog’s upper teeth. do this for 30 seconds.hold down your dog’s lower lip and apply the same circular motion to its bottom teeth for 30 seconds. practice doing this once a day for a week. remember to give your dog a treat for good behavior afterwards. , introduce the toothpaste to your dog by placing some on your finger. let your dog smell and lick the toothpaste from your finger. by doing this, your dog will get used to the taste and texture of the toothpaste.you can do this either before or after you massage your dog’s teeth with your finger. , introduce the toothbrush by touching the front, side, and back teeth with the brush. touch both top and bottom teeth with the brush. do this for 30 seconds on both top and bottom teeth once per day for a week.make sure to reward your dog for good behavior afterwards. , once your dog is familiar with the whole process, you can begin to brush its teeth. before you start, place a dab of toothpaste on your finger and let your dog lick it off. then, place more toothpaste on the toothbrush., at a 45-degree angle, place the toothbrush on its upper teeth while holding its lip. massage the teeth with the toothbrush in small, circular motions, just like you practiced. the sides of the teeth that touch the lip will have the most plaque and tartar build-up. focus on these areas. only work on small areas at a time, lifting your dog’s lip as necessary.when removing tartar and plaque, use", "this air-freshener uses baking soda, which helps absorb odors. it also uses essentials oils, which give off a fragrant scent. here's what you'll need to make this simple air freshener:small jar scrapbook paper baking soda 10 to 20 drops essential oil scissors pen or pencil needle; , the lid needs to have a metal ring part and a flat disk part. you will need the ring part to hold the scrapbook paper to the jar and the disk part to trace a circle. you can use any size jar you want, but a small, squat jar would be ideal. this way, you won't need to use as much baking soda; you only need a little bit of baking soda to get the full effect. you can spray paint the metal ring part to make it match your paper and room decor.you can find scrapbook paper at an arts and crafts store. if you cannot find any scrapbook paper, try using some leftover gift wrap. you can also take a sheet of printer paper, and draw pretty designs on it with markers. , take the lid apart and set aside the metal ring; you will be using it later. place the metal disk onto the back/blank side of the scrapbook paper. use a pen or pencil to trace around the metal disk. once you are done tracing, you can discard or recycle the metal disk. you will not need it anymore after this. you can choose any color or pattern you want for the paper, but consider choosing something that matches the decor of your room or the season. if you cannot find a jar with a two part lid, then draw a circle onto a piece of loosely woven fabric (such as burlap) and cut it out. the circle needs to be a few inches wider than the moth of the jar., you will be using it in a moment. discard or recycle the rest of the paper. , how much baking soda you need will depend on the size of your jar., the more oil you add, the more fragrant your air freshener will be.you can use all one scent, or you can play around with mixing different scents such as lavender and vanilla, or mint and eucalyptus. lavender is great for bedrooms, because it is relaxing. citrus is great for family rooms and kitchens because it's refreshing and energizing. eucalyptus and mint are great for bathrooms because of how fresh they smell. , place the paper disk you just cut out on top of the jar. make sure that the disk is centered and that the design is facing you. place the metal ring on top of the paper. twist the metal ring close. the paper disk will have replaced metal disk part. you are using a paper disk instead of a metal one for this air freshener because you will need to poke holes into it. it is easier to poke holes into paper than into metal. if you are using fabric, place the fabric on top of the", "though the quadratic formula described above is a valuable tool, it isn't the only way to solve quadratic equations. for example, some quadratic equations can be factored, which involves rewriting them in a way that makes them easy to solve. to start, however, you'll want to have your equation in standard quadratic form: ax2 + bx + c = 0. in this section, we'll only be dealing with quadratics that have an \"a\" variable equal to 1. if the a variable is not 1, the process is a little harder (see below.) let's use x2 + 7x + 12 = 0 as our example equation in this section. in the next few steps, we'll factor and solve our equation. , \"factoring\" is just a term that means \"finding the values that multiply together to give you something else.\" in this case, we're trying to break our quadratic equation down to its factors. since the x term with the highest exponent is x2 (or, in other words, x × x), we'll start by setting up the factored form of the equation like this: (x + _)(x + _) = 0. note the blank spaces — in the next few steps, we'll fill these in to complete the factored equation. , next, list all of the numbers that can multiply together to give you the c term in your quadratic equation. these are its factors. in our equation (x2 + 7x + 12 = 0), 12 is our c term. the numbers that can multiply to make 12 are: 1 and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4. this means the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. , from your short list of numbers that multiply together to make your c value, pick the two that add up to make your b term. to be clear, you're not looking for factors of your b term — just two numbers that add together to make it. in our equation (x2 + 7x + 12 = 0), our b term is 7. our list of factors for c are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. 3 and 4 add up to 7, so these are the numbers we want. if there weren't two numbers in this list of factors that added up to 7, we would say that the equation is \"unfactorable over the integers.\"basically, for our purposes, this means that the equation can't be factored and that we'll have to use another method to find the roots. , now, simply fill in the blanks in the factored form of the equation you've prepared with the two numbers you just chose from the list of factors. this gives you the factored form of your original quadratic equation. let's fill in the blanks in the factored form of our quadratic equation: (x + 3)(x + 4) = 0. , now, all you need to do to find the roots of your original quadratic equation is to set the terms in each parentheses equal to 0 and solve for x. since", "medical records often contain highly sensitive and private information. only specific individuals have access to your medical records. states vary in procedures and policy in regards to handing out medical records, as do individual hospitals. however, federal law dictates that an individual has the right to access his or her medical records, make copies, and request amendments. for the most part, only you and your doctor have the right to access your medical records.in rare cases, you might need to obtain someone else's records. you will need a direct authorization signed by the patient. if the patient is incapacitated, legal documents will be needed to waive the signature. however, protocol for requesting someone else's records is a subject of debate and confusion in the medical community. if you need someone else's medical records for any reason, discuss the issue with an attorney to figure out the procedures necessary to obtaining that information.married couples do not have the right to one another's medical records and signed authorization is needed to obtain a spouse's records. parents usually have access to the medical records of children under 18 but there are some exceptions. if, for example, a child is over 12 some states allow records regarding reproductive health and sexual history to remain confidential.; , to obtain your records, you need certain materials. make sure you know you have all the necessary paperwork filled out before beginning the process of requesting records. your healthcare provider's health information management department (him) can provide you with the authorization form specific to your hospital. this will need to be filled out in full.information included in the authorization form varies from state to state and hospital to hospital. however, most forms ask for your address, date of birth, social security number, and phone number. you will also probably have to provide the dates you received treatment, what documents you want released, and your reasons for requesting the records.many hospitals, in order to speed up the process, allow the authorization form to be filled out online. check if this is an option at your hospital if completing the forms online is more convenient for you.when you go in to request your records, you will need a photo id., fees vary from hospital to hospital, but there is specific protocol when it comes to charging for records. be aware of this to avoid paying unlawful fees. hospitals do have the right to charge fees for medical records. however, these fees are limited to the costs of the labor required to obtain the records. in other words, your hospital cannot use your records to make a profit.usually, a hospital will charge a fee based on the number of pages in your records. there is a cap as to how much this fee is that varies from state to state. in new york, it's 75 cents a page and in california it's 25. know what the maximum price per page is in your state and make sure you're not being overcharged. you can usually find this information on the department of health's website.to", "determine the route you want to travel and look at the available times. train schedules are available on a number of websites (including english language sites). a few examples include seat61.com (which includes train schedules and information from all around the world) and chinatrainguide.com.train schedules can also be had at local train stations. however, the availability of schedules in english may vary greatly from city to city. cities that typically have large numbers of tourists are the most likely to have schedules in other languages.; , tickets are typically available 60 days before departure online and 58 days before departure at the station. keep in mind that most long-distance trains do sell out, so you may want to book some time in advance.there are a number of websites that list available tickets. the most used booking site for people in china is 12306.cn, but this site is only in chinese. a few, such as chinahighlights.com and china-diy-travel.com, are in english. , you can book through the websites listed in the above step. be aware that only chinahighlights.com lists the prices in u.s. dollars (others list them in renminbi). purchasing in person at the station is convenient. you will pay for the ticket and receive it immediately. however, it can be clumsy if you do not speak chinese. you can pay for the ticket directly on the website, but you cannot print out the ticket at home. you will receive an e-ticket number, but you cannot use that for boarding. the website chinahighlights.com can send the ticket to a hotel front desk or reserve it for you at the train station's ticket office.the website china-diy-travel.com will only reserve the ticket at the station., of course, if you are taking a train during a busy travel season, you may want to arrive even earlier. during the chinese new year (or spring festival) period, some recommend that you arrive two hours in advance.be sure of which station you are going to, as some places (like beijing) have multiple stations. the name of the station will be clearly printed on your ticket. consider taking the subway or a cab to reach the station you will depart from. the biggest cities have fast and efficient sudway lines, and most such lines include connections to regional transportation hubs. in smaller cities or at times of lower traffic volume, cabs are also readily available. most cost little (at least for anyone familiar with u.s. rates). understand that those waiting to get into the state might not be lined up. queuing, as the british call it, is almost rare in china. of course, its actually rare everywhere in the world except for the u.s., canada, some portions of europe, and a few former european colonies. just be patient and follow the

well, and manifest the same symptoms. if you feel that your child or loved one acts differently or more out of control than normal, he may have adhd. there are signs to look for in case you think your child or loved one may have adhd. notice if he daydreams a lot, loses things a lot, forgets about things, can't keep still, is excessively talkative, takes unnecessary risks, makes careless decisions and mistakes, cannot or has trouble resisting temptation, has trouble taking turns in games, or has a problem getting along with other people. if your child or loved one has any number of these issues, you may need to have him or her checked for adhd.; , the american psychiatric association (apa) publishes the diagnostic and statistical manual (dsm), currently in its fifth edition, which is used by mental health professionals to diagnose mental disorders such as adhd. it states there are three presentations of adhd and that several symptoms must have been demonstrated by the age of 12, in more than one setting, for at least six months to qualify for a diagnosis. a diagnosis must be made by a trained professional. symptoms must be inappropriate for the person’s developmental level and be seen as interrupting normal functioning on the job or in social or school settings. for hyperactive-impulsive presentation, some symptoms must be seen as disruptive. symptoms also cannot be better explained by or attributable to another mental or psychotic disorder. the dsm-5 criteria require that children 16 and under must have at least six symptoms in a category to gain the diagnosis while those 17 and older need five symptoms., there are three presentations of adhd. one is inattentive adhd, which has a distinct set of symptoms. people with this form of adhd will have at least five to six of the symptoms, which present when the person: makes careless mistakes and is inattentive to detail in work, school, or with other activities. has trouble paying attention during tasks or while playing. doesn’t seem to be paying attention when someone is talking directly to him or her. doesn’t follow through with homework, chores, or jobs and is easily sidetracked. is organizationally challenged. avoids tasks requiring sustained focus, such as schoolwork. can’t keep track of or often loses keys, glasses, papers, tools, or other possessions. is easily distracted. is forgetful., the symptoms of this presentation have to be so significant that they are considered disruptive for them to be considered viable adhd symptoms. the behaviors to look out for include: being fidgety or squirmy, such as constantly tapping the hands or feet. the child running or climbing inappropriately. the adult constantly feeling restless. struggling to play quietly or do quiet activities. being constantly on the go without breaks. excessive talking. blurting out even before questions are asked. struggling to wait for his turn. interrupting others or inserting himself into others’ discussions or games.being very impatient. saying inappropriate comments, showing", "canvas seats can be made to fit any size person, or project. for a small child, 2 yards (1.8 m) of the canvas will be appropriate, while adults will need 3-4 yards of fabric to form a proper seat. most canvas should come at a standard width of 1.75 yards.if you want a deeper chair, fold the canvas long-ways, making your cuts along the longer edges of the fabric. if you want your chair wider, cut along the short side. in general, the short-side cut makes a better chair.; , fold the canvas in half, short-ways. orient the folded edge to your left. mark a point about 7 inches to the left of the top right corner and draw a light diagonal line with pencil, toward the bottom right corner. this is where you'll cut. again, make sure the folded edge is oriented to your left. you want to cut the unfolded side of the fabric. , go slowly, taking care to avoid creating a raggedy edge to work with. if you do, don't worry too much, because you can fold it over later while you're assembling and creating the edges. open up the canvas and spread it out to work. you should have a four-sided shape, with two angled edges of equal length, a long side and a short side. orient the fabric so the shortest side is at the top. , fold each edge back half an inch, then fold it again and iron. pin them in place, and then stitch the fold twice in two parallel lines to reinforce it. hemming the top and bottom of the chair seat will help to prevent tearing after frequent use. hem the diagonal edges as well, but only once. after hemming the long and short sides, fold the diagonals that you cut earlier about a half inch, as you did the other edges. pin, press, and sew the edge to reinforce it. , fold an inch and a half pocket back on each hemmed diagonal edge, then iron. sew two reinforced lines along the hem, creating a pocket seam large enough to pull the rope through. reinforce your beginning and ending with back stitches. these pockets are going to be holding your weight, so they need to be secure. , get creative and use your fabric paint to express yourself through your hammock chair. to prevent a mess, consider placing your canvas on a large sheet of cardboard. consider painting both sides as you will see the back and bottom of the chair. allow for ample dry time before proceeding to next step. you can also use printed fabric, but be sure it is upholstery weight or outdoor fabric to ensure its strength. , mark two holes at each end of the dowel, at 2” and 4”. then drill through the holes using your 3/8\" bit. sand the hole to remove any little burrs and clean up the drilling. if you like the natural wood tone, you can leave it or, you can stain the dowel if desired. , tie a large", "a great way to help illustrate a certain concept is to use analogies. one popular analogy to explain seo is the library analogy.most people are familiar with how libraries work; children and teenagers often have to use libraries to obtain sources and information for their school projects and reports. , using your client and his or her website in your library analogy might help your client make the connections. it will also help keep him or her engaged. , compare your client's website to a book on a familiar subject, preferably one that has something to do with his or her website. try to use a variation of the website's name as the title, and a variation of your client's name as the author. for example: if your client's name is bob mcbob, and bob's window cleaning is the name of his website, use window cleaning by bob windowman as your fictional book. window cleaning is something that your client can relate to, which will help keep him engaged. while you are at it, compare your client's competitors' websites to other books in the library on the same topic. so wendy's windows could become a book called wonderfully clean windows by wendy wonders. , the two ways someone can find your client's website is by either typing the url into the address bar directly, or by typing in keywords into the search bar of a reputable search engine. similarly, the two ways someone can find a book in a library is by either finding the book on the shelf, or by typing keywords into the library's computer. for example: bob mcbob specializes in cleaning windows on multistory buildings. to find his website, someone could go to a reputable search engine, and type in words such as \"window cleaning\" and \"multistory\" and the city or suburb that bob mcbob has his business in. window cleaning by bob windowman happens to have an entire chapter on cleaning windows on multistory buildings. someone could find his book by going to the library computer and search the catalog using the terms \"window cleaning\" and \"multistory\" or \"skyscrapers.\" , if a book is not categorized properly in the library catalog, then no one will be able to find it. similarly, no one will be able to find your client's website unless it contains the keywords people would most likely type into a search engine while trying to find it. a person searching for window cleaning by bob windowman won't find the book if the book is not tagged in the library catalog. a person searching for someone to clean his or her windows on a multistory house won't be able to find bob mcbob's website unless he uses keywords, such as \"window cleaning\" and \"multistory\" on his website. , one of the reasons someone might choose a certain book over another is because it had good reviews. a well-reviewed book might even be displayed at the front section of the library on a shelf titled \"good reads\" or \"top-reviewed.\" similarly, the more websites link to your client's", "make sure that the friends that you hang out with on a daily basis are mature teenagers. emulate mature characteristics of the adults or role models in your life. take note of how they interact with people and conduct themselves in public. if you surround yourself with immature people, you are more likely to act immaturely.find a role model that has a clear set of values and qualities that you admire. you might find a positive role model in your school, religious community, after school activity, or even within your family.; , understanding that you don’t know everything is important to becoming a mature teenager. be receptive to learning new things. make it a goal to learn something new each day. learning doesn’t always have to happen in the classroom. you also learn from your parents, friends, and community members to do things like cook, drive, and manage money.research things that you don’t know by looking it up on the internet, going to the library, or asking an expert. ask questions while you are learning to gain a deeper understanding. read lots of books to gain new perspective and spark your imagination. reading is an excellent way to learn new things and gain perspective on all sorts of situations. check out books from categories that interest you, such as sci-fi, fantasy, philosophy, nature, astronomy, and biography. , be open and welcome to feedback. getting angry or defensive when you are given feedback is very childish. actively listen and learn from the feedback that is given to you. in order to actively listen, you must listen with all of your senses instead of merely “hearing” what is being said.accept feedback from your teachers to improve your schoolwork. for example, apply the comments on your last research paper to improve your next research paper. receive constructive criticism from your coaches or mentors to succeed in afterschool activities. for example, apply the tips that your coach gives you during your practice to improve your technique. ask for feedback when feedback is not initially given to you. for example, when you receive a bad grade on a paper with little feedback, consider staying after class to discuss the paper with your teacher. say something like, “could you give me some feedback on how to make this paper better? i would like to make a better grade on the next assignment for this class.” , don’t make excuses for things that you have done wrong. resist the urge to blame other people, even if they were involved. own up to your mistakes and learn from them. on the other hand, you should take credit for things that you have done well.take responsibility for your grades instead of blaming them on your teachers. admit to breaking or damaging something even if no one was watching. accept and serve and punishments given to you at school instead of asking your parents to talk to the administration. , as you grow up you will need to learn to communicate more effectively. effective and mature communication is key to gain

institute of medicine recommends that men drink about 13 cups (three liters) of fluids per day. women should drink about nine cups (2.2 liters) of fluids per day.if you’re sick or you exercise a lot, you’ll need to drink more.water is the best choice. drinking a half-cup of fresh-squeezed lemon juice daily raises the citrate levels in your urine, which can help reduce your risk of developing calcium kidney stones. experts no longer recommend orange juice, as it raises oxalate levels.be cautious with grapefruit juice, apple juice, and cranberry juice. several studies have linked grapefruit juice to an increased risk of kidney stones, although not all studies agree.apple and cranberry juice both contain oxalates, which are linked to the development of kidney stones. cranberry juice may increase your risk for calcium oxalate and uric acid stones. however, it may help prevent the less-common types of stones, such as struvite and brushite stones, and it’s good for overall kidney function.talk with your doctor about whether consuming these juices is a good idea for you. , consuming too much salt can cause kidney stones by increasing the calcium content of your urine. read nutritional labels carefully and avoid processed foods, which tend to be high in sodium. use the following sodium guidelines:consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium daily if you are a healthy young adult. according to the us department of agriculture, most americans eat far more than that recommended allowance, 3,400 mg.restrict your sodium to 1,500 mg per day if you are at least middle aged or you have certain conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. look for “lower sodium” or “no salt added” labels on canned foods. canned vegetables and soups often have high levels of salt. luncheon meat, hot dogs, and frozen prepared meals often have extremely high levels of sodium, so check labels before you buy., a diet high in animal protein, especially red meats, increases your risk of developing kidney stones, especially uric acid stones.limiting your animal protein intake to 6 ounces or less per day helps reduce your risk of forming all types of kidney stones.red meats, organ meats, and shellfish are high in a substance called purine, which increases your body’s production of uric acid and can cause kidney stones.eggs and fish also contain purines, although at a lower level.substitute some of your animal protein with other rich sources of protein, such as nuts and legumes. , citric acid from fruits acts as a protective factor by coating existing kidney stones, making it difficult for them to increase in size. your doctor may prescribe medications such as calcium citrate or potassium citrate; these are not dietary sources and work differently.lemons and limes are the best source of citric acid. drinking lemonade or limeade (especially low-sugar varieties) and squeezing lemon or lime juice on foods are excellent ways of increasing your citric acid intake. increasing your fruit and vegetable intake will help", "the fugu fish produces a deadly toxin called tetrodotoxin, which causes the body's central nervous system to gradually shut down. people who are poisoned by tetrododoxin are fully conscious as they experience symptoms like dizziness, muscle paralysis, incoherent speech, asphyxia, and cardiac arrest.fugu is safe to eat when it is prepared correctly by an experienced chef, but if it is prepared incorrectly, a single bite can kill a person.there is no antidote for tetrododoxin, so many people who are exposed to it die.; , if you are in japan, you should have a relatively easy time finding a restaurant that serves fugu sashimi. it is very important, however, to ensure that the establishment has a good reputation and is licensed to serve the fish. most incidents of fugu poisoning occur at unlicensed establishments where inexperienced chefs prepare the fugu.there are a handful of restaurants in the united states that are licensed to serve fugu sashimi, although it must be imported from japan pre-sliced.fugu is illegal in the european union., in order to be legally permitted to prepare fugu, a chef must be licensed. this is meant to ensure that only the most skilled and well-trained chefs are allowed prepare this potentially deadly fish. if you plan on trying it, make sure to ask for evidence that the chef is properly licensed.to get licensed, a chef must undergo a three-year apprenticeship program and take a rigorous exam, which the majority of applicants fail. chefs in the united states may not have this license, as they do not slice the sashimi themselves. (this is still done by a licensed individual in japan.), the liver, ovaries, and intestines contain the highest concentrations of toxins, so these should be avoided by all except the biggest risk-takers. the meat of the fish contains very little poison, unless of course it is contaminated by the organs during preparation.organs are sometimes served with the sashimi, but they must be specially treated to remove the toxins and are more risky to eat than the meat.the testicles are also very poisonous, but these are considered a delicacy in some areas., there are many different species of fugu, all of which are poisonous. while they are all potentially dangerous, the torafugu or tiger puffer has the least poisonous blood, which makes it the safest to eat., some companies are raising fugu in captivity and restricting their diets to prevent them from producing their deadly poison. if you want to limit your risks when trying fugu sashimi, consider eating a farm-raised fish.research is still being done on the safety of farm-raised fugu, so it's best to still stick with a licensed chef, even if the fish is farm-raised., while there is no antidote for tetrodotoxin, immediate medical intervention may be able to save your life if you are exposed. doctors can use activated charcoal to absorb the poison and can also help you breathe so you don't asphyxiate from the toxin's effects.if your tongue feels numb, you need medical attention right away, as this is usually the first symptom. a slight tingling in", "what don't you like about yourself? maybe it's your lack

will sell 530 t-shirts if it drops the price to $24. alt revenue = $24 x 530 = $12,720 marginal revenue = 12720−12500530−500=22030 \\displaystyle \\frac 12720-12500 530-500 = \\frac 220 30 ≈ $7.33 , you'll generally need access to a company's internal inventory figures or sales reports to determine the number of products sold. finding the alternate price to sell one more unit is much more difficult, and requires skill market analysis. remember, marginal revenue is only useful when analyzing a single product. some reports may only list data for groups of products. , a negative marginal revenue means the company would lose revenue if it lowered the price. in this case, selling more products would not make up for the lowered revenue per product. , companies that optimize the price/sales balance are said to have a level of output where the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost. marginal cost is the cost to the company of producing one more unit of product.marginal cost = altproductioncost−currentproductioncostaltproductssold−currentproductssold \\displaystyle \\frac altproductioncost-currentproductioncost altproductssold-currentproductssold . for example, it costs kim's soda $50 to produce 200 cans of soda. kim's could spend $60 instead to produce 225 cans. marginal cost = 60−50225−200 \\displaystyle \\frac 60-50 225-200 = $0.40. kim's soda should only enact this plan if marginal revenue is equal to or greater than $0.40. , in the examples above, we've been dealing with a simplified market model that considers only one company without competition (a monopoly).more commonly, companies are under pressure to keep prices low due to competition. under perfect competition, marginal revenue doesn't change as a result of the number of products sold, because prices are fixed. for instance, let's say that kim's, the soda company from the examples above, is now in competition with hundreds of other soda firms. the price per can is set at $0.50 — any lower and kim's will lose money, and any higher and customers will choose other products. marginal revenue is always $0.50, since kim's cannot sell cans for any other price. , in real life, the small, competing firms that make up highly competitive markets aren't perfect. they don't instantly react to each others' price changes, they don't have perfect knowledge of their competition, and they don't always set their prices for maximum profitability. this sort of market system is called \"monopolistic competition.\" marginal revenue will typically decrease with each additional product sold, but not as steeply as it would in a monopoly. for example, kim's drops the price of its soda from $1 to $0.85. it may still receive additional revenue, but in a monopolistic market, customers will still buy their competitors' soda for a higher price. , in an oligopoly, a few large firms that are in competition with each other control the market. marginal revenue usually has a downward trend with each additional unit sold, as it would in", "you know you're not going to be a digital nomad forever. before you start saving for retirement, you need to have a good idea what country you will live in when you do retire, so you can maintain your savings in that currency.if possible, you also want to set up your savings and investment accounts in that country, so they'll be easier to access once you do retire. most digital nomads plan on retiring in their home country. don't choose another country unless you are certain you'll be able to immigrate there when you're ready to retire and settle down. , you want to have an emergency fund separate from your retirement savings. look at your budget and determine how much your expenses will be, on average, for at least three months.this money will protect you and enable you to survive as a digital nomad if, for example, you lose a contract or have a hard time finding work in one location. you also may want to include sufficient money for a plane ticket, so if you get into a difficult situation somewhere you can quickly bail out and return to your home country or somewhere else where you feel safe. keep this money in a basic savings account so it will earn interest, but you can access it quickly if you need to do so. , while life as a digital nomad may seem carefree and simple, your finances typically will be anything but simple. look for a licensed or certified financial planner who has experience working with digital nomads.you don't necessarily have to keep a financial planner on retainer long-term, but it's a good idea to at least consult someone when you're setting up your savings and investment accounts. ask the financial planner about sound investment strategies, and put the framework for your savings and investments in place. you also want to ask about tax strategies. , having too many financial accounts can be difficult to keep up with when you're traveling, especially if you have accounts scattered across several different countries. while this sometimes can be unavoidable for digital nomads, you want to try to have as few accounts as possible.for example, if you settle in one country for a longer period of time and take a day job, you may need to open a local bank account. when you move on somewhere else, close that account. try to have a specific purpose for each account you have. for example, you might have a retirement savings account, a checking account for daily expenses, and a basic savings account for your emergency fund. , when you're traveling, it can be relatively easy to rack up significant fines and fees, as well as facing significant tax consequences, if you're not careful. work with a professional financial advisor to build a sound strategy.you typically will need at least one credit card, but try to pick one that has the best rewards for you as you're traveling, as well as the strongest purchase protection. choose a card that doesn't have an annual fee.", "you’re going to be mixing and sanding concrete to make your bowl, so work outside if weather permits. otherwise, pick an air area with strong air circulation. if necessary, set up fans and/or open windows to improve airflow., drape a dropcloth, tarp, or similar covering over your worktable. do the same for the floor or any other nearby surfaces that may potentially get dirty from your project. then secure your covering(s) in place with duct tape. this will make clean-up a cinch., wear work gloves to protect your hands. also wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. additionally, wear a dust mask, even if air circulation is strong, since mixing and sanding concrete will still introduce a lot of particles into the air., you’re going to need two bowls of different sizes in order to cast your mold: one to shape the fire bowl’s exterior, and a smaller one to shape its interior. first, pick one that matches the size you have in mind for your fire bowl. then choose a smaller one that will fit inside the first. also make sure that the smaller bowl is:wide enough to fit a sterno can, with ample space left over between the can and the bowl’s rim to fill with fire glass or stones. deep enough so that the top of the sterno can is below the bowl’s rim, in order to contain spills. roughly half the size of the larger bowl to ensure that the fire bowl’s walls will be sufficiently

than you think you’ll need. follow the brand’s instructions on how much water to mix that particular formula, and in what increments.shapecrete and quikrete are two popular brands for small diy

then do the same with the exterior of the smaller bowl. lubricate them now so that concrete won’t cement with them as it dries., use a trowel to fill the bottom of your larger bowl with wet concrete. as you do, flatten the concrete so it’s nice and flat. once the bottom is covered, use a level to make sure the flat surface is level., once the concrete in the larger bowl is flat and level, set the smaller bowl on top of it. judge its depth within the larger bowl. if its rim stands higher than the larger bowl, remove it, empty some of the concrete, and try again. if, on the other hand, the smaller bowl is still too deep inside for your taste:take the smaller bowl out and add more concrete. as you do, just remember that you want to keep the concrete flat and level. also check the smaller

accuse you of overreacting. stay centered in your own perceptions, and learn how to identify passive aggression. some expressions of passive-aggressive behavior include sarcastic remarks and responses, being overly critical, temporary compliance (the person verbally agrees to the request but chooses to delay acting upon it), intentional inefficiency (the person complies with the request but fulfills the request in a poor manner), allowing a problem to escalate through inaction and taking pleasure in the resulting anguish, sneaky and deliberate actions taken in order to get revenge, complaints of injustice, and the silent treatment. \"i'm not mad\" and \"i was just joking\" are some common things that passive-aggressive people say.other signs of passive aggression can include hostility toward demands made on their time, even if it's understated, hostility toward figures of authority or those more fortunate, procrastination in dealing with other people's requests, purposefully doing a bad job for other people, acting cynical, sullen, or argumentative, and complaints about being under-appreciated.passive-aggressive behavior is defined as indirect resistance to the demands of others and an avoidance of direct confrontation. the avoidance of direct confrontation is where we may find the most trouble.; , it might seem like a person's trying to get under your skin, but it's also possible that you are being overly suspicious and taking their behavior personally. examine your own insecurities — are you used to people in your past giving you a hard time? does this person remind you of that? are you assuming this person is doing what the people in your past did? put yourself in the other person's shoes. from that perspective, do you think a reasonable person might act similarly in those circumstances?bear in mind, too, that some people may be constantly late or slow to complete a task because of a disorder like adhd. don't be quick to assume that their behavior is actually directed at you. , dealing with a passive-aggressive person can make you feel frustrated, angry, and even despairing. it may seem as though there is nothing you can say or do to please the person.you may feel hurt by being on the receiving end of passive-aggressive behaviors. for example, perhaps the person has given you the silent treatment. you may feel frustrated that the person often complains, but never seems to take steps to improve his or her situation. pay close attention to your instincts. being around the person may leave you feeling tired or deflated, since you've spent so much energy trying to deal with the passive aggressive behavior. , the power of positive thinking helps in coping with the daily affairs of life. passive-aggressive people will try to drag you into a vortex of negativity. they are looking for a negative response sometimes so they can put the focus back on you without getting blamed for it. don’t allow this to happen.staying

meters x 2.4 meters), as you will need to fold it to make the stretcher.if you cannot find a large blanket, you can try putting together two smaller blankets so they are at least 8 feet by 8 feet (2.4 meters x 2.4 meters).; , while you don't need to use poles to create a simple stretcher, they will make your stretcher sturdier. you will also need two poles that are of equal length and at least 8 feet long (2.4 meters). look for wooden poles that are at least two inches thick, as this will ensure they are sturdy. you can use wooden poles that you cut down from a tree and shave down to be the same length and width. or you may use metal poles.make sure the poles are equal in length, as you do not want a lopsided stretcher. the poles should also be sturdy enough to hold some weight, as they will act as supports for both sides of the stretcher. if you do not have poles, you can make a very simple stretcher with just a blanket. , you may decide to have a roll of duct tape on hand in case you want to secure the stretcher with the tape once you have put it together. if you are using a wool blanket, you may not need duct tape to secure the stretcher, as the friction between the two ends of the wool blanket will keep it in place. if you are using a tarp, you may decide to use the tape to secure the stretcher., start by spreading out the blanket or tarp on an even surface, such as the floor. make sure no corners are folded over and the blanket is laying flat. you may also place the two poles next to the blanket so they are easy to access., you will first need to check that the blanket and the poles are around the same length. this will ensure there is no extra material hanging off the sides of the stretcher. measure the length of the stretcher by placing one of the poles on the blanket lengthwise. if the pole is not in line with the end of the blanket, you may need to fold over the end or both ends of the blanket so the blanket is around the same length as the poles. you may make the blanket about one to two inches shorter than the length of the poles so some of the pole sticks out on either end of the blanket. this will make it easier to hold and lift the poles once you use the stretcher. , once you have confirmed the length of the blanket, you will need to determine how wide the stretcher is going to be. start by placing one pole lengthwise about two feet from

will want to seek treatment with a counselor before you hurt yourself or others.assess whether you often find yourself in arguments with friends, family or acquaintances. although arguments can be common in relationships, those that escalate quickly and happen very frequently can be signs of an anger control problem. go back through your track record with the law. look into whether you have had frequent problems with the law or driving rage that led to traffic tickets.; , not all anger is expressed openly. if you are incited to anger that you hold in, you may have benefit from anger management treatment. take note of how you respond to both the more obvious anger-eliciting situations, such as if someone is very rude to you, as well as more every day activities, such as watching television, commuting, driving or working in general. , anger is a powerful and highly visceral emotion, often leaving a trace on your body. take note of how your body feels and pay attention to particular signs of anger. there are several bodily signs of anger. these include grinding of the teeth, clenching of the fists, headache or stomach ache, an increased heart rate, feeling hot or dizzy, redness of the face, having sweaty palms, or clenching of the fists or general tensing of your body. , people with anger control issues can have trouble concentrating once they feel anger. they may be unable to compromise, feel empathy or accept that other people's views are different from their own.some people find that they channel this obsession with an angry feeling with sarcasm, pacing and raising their voices. you may find that you lose your sense of humor quickly when anger starts to rise. , one sign that you may benefit from anger management treatment is if your anger is having a negative impact on others or your relationships with them.do others end up hurt physically or emotionally after you have an episode of anger? do you find yourself losing social connections because of your anger? do you find yourself regretting the way you treated others as a result of your angry outbursts? if so, then the costs of your anger are steep and you may benefit from anger management.because of their hostility, individuals with anger issues tend to have fewer friends. social support is an important factor that can help protect from stress and illness., frequent anger can make you feel bad, and be bad for you.if you find yourself having frequent headaches or other bodily distress and think this may be caused by your anger, you may benefit from anger management.

will help you determine if this is the right breed to bring into your home. expect your lab to be loyal, lovable, and happy. these positive traits make him the number one registered dog in the american kennel club. anticipate a boisterous and energetic temperament. the lab has the reputation of being one of the most sweet-natured breeds, and is outgoing, eager to please, and friendly with both people and other animals. ; , chocolate labs make great additions to homes with small children or other pets, and are well-suited for homes that have a good deal of space. prepare for clumsiness. a young lab can be accurately described as a “bull in a china shop!” this means that you can expect vases to be knocked over by wagging tails, and carpets to be displaced by skidding dogs. , chewing and mouthing is a common problem among labradors, and this breed requires an ample amount of chew toys on hand to prevent the destruction of your valuable possessions. consider the need to enroll your chocolate lab in obedience training. plan to train your chocolate lab before he gets too large to control. as the chocolate lab is a relatively large dog, teaching him manners is vital. this includes learning not to nip (playful bites), not to jump on people or barge them over, and to relieve themselves in appropriate locations. , all labs love activity and require it for a happy and healthy life! prepare to exercise your chocolate labs. this breed needs exercise to keep their cardiovascular and muscular systems healthy. every adult labrador should have a minimum daily walk of at least half an hour, and a longer and more vigorous exercise session of 1-2 hours at least three times a week. expect to give your labrador the opportunity to run every day in order to burn off excess energy. , a male chocolate lab can weigh up to 80lbs, meaning that he will eat a lot of dog food. in addition to food, veterinary costs can be very high, and you should budget for some kind of pet insurance. ensure you are financially secure enough to purchase a chocolate lab. , while chocolate labs are generally healthy dogs, they can be plagued with certain health issues that must be identified and managed. health problems can be inherited genetically (including cancer, epilepsy, and autoimmune diseases), or can be caused by the environment (contact with chemicals, medications, breathing in smoke). some of the more common health problems include hip and/or elbow dysplasia, obesity, epilepsy, cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy (pra), tricuspid valve dysplasia, gastric dilation-volvulus, myopathy, cold tail, and ear infections. visit your veterinarian if you have any concerns regarding your chocolate lab’s health. if you see signs or symptoms indicating the onset of any of these conditions, it is best to get your dog checked by his vet as soon as possible. , there is nothing like a new puppy, with his cute and", "the best way to prepare you to row on a boat in the water is by building your body strength on a water rower machine. this machine will target all the areas on your body that you will be using when in an actual boat: your legs, core, and upper body. you can purchase one of these machines for home use, or you can find them in many gyms or work out facilities.; , there are many exercises you can do to strengthen your core and abs. these exercises will help target not just your core, but your upper body as well:plank: lie face down on the ground. place your elbows on the ground underneath your shoulders with your forearms extended straight in front of you. then, left yourself up on your toes and your forearms, keeping your body straight. hold this position for 30 seconds to two minutes, increasing the amount of time you hold as you get stronger. side plank: begin in the same position as the plank and lift yourself up onto your arms and toes. then, slowly turn your body to the side, so that your weight is resting on one foot and one arm (either your left foot and arm or your right). make sure your body is in a straight line and you aren't leaning over. hold this position for 30 seconds to two minutes and then switch to the other side. v-sit hold: sit on the ground with your legs straight in front of you and your upper body straight. then, extend your arms out in front of you and slowly lift your legs off the ground. as you lift your legs off the ground, keep them straight, and slowly lean your upper body back, making sure to keep your back straight as you do so. hold this position for 30 to 90 seconds. , your lower body is important when it comes to rowing because 60 percent of the strength you use to row should come from your legs. there are many exercises you can do to improve lower body strength, but a few to start with are: bridge: lie on your back with you knees bent and feet flat against the floor, hip width apart. then, slowly lift up your butt, using your glutes, until you have a straight line going from your shoulders to your knees. hold the position for one to two minutes, or lower your butt and raise it again at a quick pace without letting your butt touch the ground. to make this position even harder, you can extend one leg straight out, keeping it in the air as you raise your butt. barbell squat: stand with your feet shoulder width apart and place a barbell behind your head across your shoulders and grip it with your hands. squat like you are about to sit down, keeping your upper body straight and your chest out. go as low as you can and then, stand back up and repeat. do three sets of 12 reps.barbell/dumbbell lunges: start by standing up", "it's very important that you find positive ways to interact with your sibling. one of the best ways to do this is just to do fun things together, things which you both like to do. playing games together or going for a bike ride together will help you get to know one another while in a relaxing and fun atmosphere. in order to have a good relationship it's important to be involved in each other's lives and spend time together. this doesn't mean living in each other's pockets, but rather making time for your sibling and looking for positive ways to interact. having a reservoir of good experiences will help act as a buffer when a problem or conflict arises. you will work together more effectively if you can draw on happy memories of having fun together.; , as well as doing fun things together, you can help develop a strong relationship by demonstrating that you are there for your sibling and you support him. for example, if your brother has a big sports game go along and cheer him on. even if you are not a big sports fan you are supporting your brother. he will appreciate you making the effort to be there and showing that you care, even if he doesn't tell you that.supporting each other also means saying kind things, like congratulating your brother on his report card, and offering to help out with a chore or some work every now and then.if you complete chores as a team you will become closer as you learn to cooperate more effectively. for example, if you have to wash up, split the tasks so one person does the washing, and one does the drying. , try to maintain good communication with your sibling even if you are having difficulties getting along. just making small talk can help to ease tensions which might otherwise escalate if you are not talking. you need to learn to understand each other and if there is a specific problem just listening to your sibling's concerns is the best way to start doing this. take time to listen and acknowledge any grievances and work constructively to talk them through. when your sibling is talking really ask yourself \"what does my sibling want me to know, what are they telling me?\"remember communication is about giving and receiving information, so listen carefully and don't assume to know what someone is going to say. you can involve your parents and have family meetings to talk about any problems you are having with your sibling., although you are siblings, you are not the same person. you have different personalities, different interests and different strengths. an important part of building a strong and lasting relationship is understanding and appreciating these differences.you might want to play soccer all the time, but your brother wants to play music or do some reading. don't think of your differences as things that divide you. if your parents keep signing you up for things because your brother likes them, politely and calmly say that you have", "everybody dreams--usually multiple dreams per night. however, it is very difficult to remember all these dreams. if a dream wakes you up, write that down immediately in a dream

in as much detail as possible.keep a journal, working pen, and soft lamp next to your bed to make it easier to write dreams down in the middle of the night.; , never skip a morning in your journal. even when you do not remember your dreams, note that in your journal. you will soon train your brain to remember your dreams simply by reinforcing the journaling process.it is best for you to write your dreams down immediately after waking up to make sure that your conscious mind does not rewrite or alter the plot of the dream., any dream you hope to interpret should be written down. this helps you recall your dreams in the short-term and the long-term.be sure that you write down every detail you remember as well as your emotional state upon waking.details to write down include: people you

mode of transportation in the dream the origin and destination of your dream journey the motivation for your dream journey , if you dream about journeys often, you might begin to see common themes and patterns emerging over time. by recording your dreams, you will be able to determine these recurring patterns more clearly and accurately, allowing you to better understand your own dreams.reread your dream journal to determine whether journeying is a common theme in your dreams, which could be significant. pay attention to subtle changes in your dreams over time. they might tell you whether you are growing and changing in important ways., sometimes journey dreams involve you moving under your own power, such as when you walk, run, or fly. other journey dreams involve you being moved by a vehicle such as a boat, car, or train. take a few minutes to consider whether you were moving yourself or whether something else was moving you.ask yourself whether you were the one in control or whether someone else was in charge of your journey. for example, many flying dreams involve a feeling of confidence, control, and freedom.on the other hand, a dream where you are in the caboose of a train might indicate that you feel behind in life.this can help you decide whether your journey is a positive adventure that you chose or an unpleasant decision that you are forced to make. the state of your vehicle might make a difference to the interpretation of the dream as well. a decrepit vehicle might indicate uncertainty or low self-esteem, for example. think", "putting the bar just

exposure to oxygen and sunlight should be kept to a minimum. you will need to acquire a refrigerator that is an appropriate size for the bar you have planned. you could also create space in a refrigerator you already own. opened wine bottles need to be kept cold to prevent flavor from altering. beer can be enjoyed at room temperature, however, it is commonly kept cold. many liqueurs are refrigerated. champagne is nearly always kept chilled. any older stock you have that is lower in alcohol content should be refrigerated to preserve flavor. most highly alcoholic liquors do not require refrigeration. , it might be tempting to purchase the highest quality alcohol and liquor, but it's not always necessary to do so. some liquors are used mainly in mixed drinks, so their flavor isn't as critical as other liquors that are enjoyed alone, without mixing. lower cost can mean lower quality ingredients, different taste, and different distillation techniques than more expensive brands. higher cost does not always entail a better taste! all alcohol will have the same intoxicating effect, regardless of price. , there are many different varieties of alcohol to choose from and the choice isn't always an easy one. however, there are some standards you can use to help narrow the selection process down. select varieties that you personally enjoy. keep in mind the tastes of your

ahead of time. you won’t need to do much to prepare for this bluff. invest in a box of tissues – they’ll make very simple props. if you want to go the extra mile, make sure you have some pale makeup on hand. it only takes a quick pat of white face powder or foundation to give yourself a sickly, wan appearance.; , you’ll still have a handful of symptoms to fake, but this sham depends more on your acting skills. be prepared to do a lot of temple rubbing, squinting, pouting and pretending to be sensitive to light and sound. a little pale makeup is the only physical change you’ll need to make, and even that is optional, depending on the strength of your performance. , for this reason, it’s better for getting out of work, not school. as long as you can handle discussing your bowels with your boss over the phone, the diarrhea scam is the most effective of them all because it’s rarely challenged. the key to pulling this off is the phone call conversation. you’ll need to start by sounding very reluctant and embarrassed about the whole thing. lower your voice and say something like, “this is so embarrassing, but i’m just going to come out and say it – i am having serious stomach issues today. i’m running to the bathroom every 15 minutes. it's really bad.” insert a dramatic pause before whispering the words “stomach issues.” , irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a chronic stomach affliction that’s fairly common. the main symptoms are abdominal pain/cramping, bloating, gas, and alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea, which are all virtually invisible to an outsider.only play this card if you can handle a long con, because ibs is chronic. take into consideration that chronic illnesses are serious. it's not very ethical to fake ibs. it is far more serious than a simple cold. be aware that some employers/schools will want a doctor's note for this. take your boss/teacher aside to share the information privately. ask that your illness be kept between the two of you, since it’s so personal. say that you “suffer from ibs” and it sometimes interferes with your daily life, but you’re working with your doctor to keep it manageable. , if you're trying to get out of work, mention this to coworkers the afternoon before. say that you’ve felt “off” all day and you’ve had trouble concentrating. when someone asks you a question, stare off into space and pretend you

your legs and thighs are not clearly visible too! think a mini length shift dress, or a low cut top with a knee length or just above the knee length pencil skirt.; , insulting, suggestive or improper

cost less to buy, last longer, and, most importantly, cost next to nothing to maintain. if you prefer the feel of natural fiber, try synthetics on the legs, which are less sensitive, and outer layers, which are not felt much. if you're not sure about the surface appearance, at least try them on the legs, which are not observed as closely. you can find high quality products in some thrift stores if you know what you are looking for. , too-tight clothing is not classy! tailored looks are a key feature of classy dressing. squeezing into a dress is not classy! , there will always be days where a nice over sized hoodie and tracksuit are acceptable but make wearing them the exception and not the rule. baggy clothes do not make you look smaller; instead they just make you look frumpy and sloppy. , even in a casual outfit, ensure nothing is dirty, stained or damaged. tacky items will only take away from the over all appearance. colors and fine patterns hide the inevitable occasional minor damage. ,, think of any of these as a pair of thin tights. if you couldn't wear that top with just a pair of tights under it then don't wear it with your leggings. end of story. , don't be overly fussy. covering yourself in glitter and excessive orange", "there are strong arguments on either side — both for and against clipping. those who caution against it say that birds were meant to fly and we should not interfere with a parrot’s natural inclinations. clipping the parrot's wings deprives them of this basic freedom.consider other options first. if you are planning to show your bird, it should never be clipped.; , parrots respond very well to clicker training, and you can train your parrot to return to you when called. you can also use clicker training to modify unwanted behaviors, which can help your parrot stay happy and safe.if you are not willing to do the work to train a parrot, then you may want to reconsider if getting a bird is right for you. , there are some dangers to letting your bird fly free in your home. they can potentially damage their feathers, knock things over, and consume things that they should not. many household items can be dangerous to parrots, including toilets and other standing water, lightbulbs and stoves that get hot, ceiling fans, cords to blinds, and windows and mirrors.ask yourself why you want a bird if you don't want it to fly or don't feel that your home is a safe environment. consider that a different pet may be more appropriate. , parrots are quick and can take advantage of any open door or window to get out. once outside, it may be difficult to get bird back if you have not trained them. with clipped wings, the chance of escape is reduced. and if your bird does get out, it’s much easier to get them back., bird wings should not be clipped until the bird can fly. clipping too early can stunt the regular growth of the feathers., if you’ve never done it before, it’s advisable to have your vet do it the first time. that way you can see how it works and then decide if you want to continue to do it at home., find an assistant, a towel suitable for the size of the bird, a sharp pair of scissors, and styptic powder, available at pet stores. styptic powder is essential if you end up cutting too much and your parrot bleeds.if you don't want to clip your parrot's wings yourself, ask the assistant to clip them., drape the towel over both of your hands. stay relaxed and face your bird. gently wrap the towel around it if possible. if not, toss the towel over the bird and gently but firmly place your index finger on the top of its head and your other fingers around the sides of its lower beak. this will prevent biting and allow you and your assistant to arrange the towel safely. make sure the feet are secured inside the towel to prevent scratching.birds are very sensitive to stress, and it is possible that the bird may have a heart attack when forcibly restrained. , pull a wing out of the towel restraint and find the primary flight feathers. these will be the last ten and longest", "sometimes it is neglect that can make you distant from your daughter. hug her (not too much, maybe for 5 seconds) and comfort her. tell her she is beautiful. heal small hurts at random times every day. if either of you are sad or stressed comfort each other once again.; , teenage girls always have the desire to have relationships with boys, whether it's just friendship or crushing. if your daughter is comfortable with you, she will tell you once she's make a new guy-friend or likes a particular boy. get to know her, know her weaknesses and strengths and what makes her happy. be interested in what she tells you. do not look worried or angry. ask her about the boy, or even ask to meet him. then decide whether she should hang out with him or not. , don't be nosy though, that can really bug your teenage daughter. also, if she seems like she doesn't want to answer your questions, stop asking and wait for another time, teens can get moody, just like the rest of us. some examples of questions to ask are: what is your favorite book? what is your favorite movie? what is your favorite color? what is your favorite song/album/singer/band? what do you like to do in your spare time? where's your favorite place to shop? what is your favorite animal? what is your favorite or least favorite food? or you can just make up your own questions. , get to know the top models, the gossip, the fashion, the makeup, the top singers and actresses. just don't copy your teen, after all she is trying to find herself! , that's the most important thing a parent should do. , if she has a boyfriend, be supportive. once you've met the boyfriend and gotten to know him, and feel like he's the right sort, you can let her go on dates with him. if you did not feel like the boy is trustworthy, tell your daughter the reasons why without exploding or banning the relationship. , give her her own space to grow but also kindly clarify the boundaries. know that she may sometimes test these boundaries and that is when you need to remind her that she is aware of the boundaries and that they need to restored. if you disagree with your daughter's choice of clothing, tell her face to face. be reasonable. talk to her about the problems with how clothing can be suggestive and the things that certain people may assume of some types of clothing. , in other words, never be the type of parent whom your daughter would be scared of. , even though she may pretend she doesn't like it when you clean her room, she really does. some random acts you could do are: cleaning her room/bathroom cooking her an unforgettably tasty meal buying her some make up you think she would like buying her some clothes/jewelry she would enjoy , let your daughter know you trust her. and actually do trust her. once she sees that", "if you are documenting a complicated process that involves several people, teams, or departments working independent, consider making a complex flowchart. the type of flowchart described here is called a \"swim lane chart\" or \"rummler-brache chart.\"the chart makes it easy to see who is responsible for each task, and helps identify areas where the process could be improved. the flowchart should describe the process as it is currently done, not how it should be done. , the flowchart will probably end up looking tidier and more readable if you use software for creating diagrams. having an electronic file also makes it easier to make changes to the flowchart as needed. search online for \"process mapping software,\" making sure to download or purchase one that can create rummler-brache charts. , each row can be labeled with a department, team, or the job title of individual. each participant is responsible for tasks located in his horizontal row, extending across the page. this is sometimes called that participant's \"swim lane.\" the lanes may be color-coded or not. they should always be divided by bold, black lines to make the chart easily readable by color-blind people. try to put groups that interact with each other adjacent to each other. this is not mandatory, however. , begin the process by placing the first task in a box near the left hand side of the page, just to the right of the participant responsible for that task. for example, if the research division starts the process by creating a product idea, draw a box just to the right of the word \"research\" and label it create product idea. , for example, if research then sends its product idea to marketing for focus testing, draw an arrow from create product idea to a box in the marketing row, to the right of the previous box. label this box focus testing. sometimes, a task might be repeated, for instance the product might later return for additional focus testing. if the process actually returns to the same earlier stage, draw an arrow back to the original box labeled focus testing. if the process is actually different (for instance, this is a more advanced round of focus testing leading to different tasks), write a new box instead with a different name, such as advanced focus testing. , most flow charts use boxes, diamonds, and circles, plus arrows between them. you've already encountered the box, which is labeled with the name of a task. use a diamond when there are multiple possible results. use circles when an end result has been achieved. continuing the above example, draw an arrow from focus testing to a diamond labeled is product approved? draw one arrow from the diamond, labeling it no, and connect it to a circle labeled end of process. a second arrow, labeled yes can lead to the next task in the process. place the diamond in the row or \"swim lane\" of the participant who is responsible for that decision. the circle labeled end of process should be in its own row, with", "salmonella infection is usually caused by eating raw eggs or meat products that are contaminated with the bacteria. there's an incubation period of a few hours to up to 2 days, followed by symptoms that can usually be classified as gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines.the most common symptoms of a salmonella infection are the following: vomiting nausea diarrhea chills fever headache blood in the stool very hot temperature cold sweats head cold runny nose; , while salmonella usually doesn't pose a high health risk, individuals with compromised immune systems, such as people with aids, sickle cell disease or inflammatory bowel diseases, are at an increased risk of complications from salmonella poisoning. children and the elderly are also more likely to experience serious complications. if the symptoms don't seem to be ebbing, and the person experiencing them is in a higher-risk group, it's advisable to see a doctor as soon as possible. immediate medical attention should also be sought if your or the person you're concerned about experiences the following: dehydration, leading to decreased urine output, decreased tear production, dry mouth and sunken eyes. signs of bacteremia, a condition in which the salmonella enters the bloodstream and infects body tissues in the brain, spinal cord, heart, or bone marrow. a sudden high fever, chills rapid heart rate and an appearance of serious illness are signs that this may be occurring. , the doctor will assess the your symptoms and in most cases advise getting plenty of fluids and resting until the symptoms pass, since they usually go away on their own. if the doctor determines a test is necessary, a stool sample will be tested to determine whether it contains salmonella. the doctor may also decide to test a blood sample to determine whether bacteremia has occurred. the doctor may prescribe antibiotics if the salmonella infection has spread beyond the digestive system. if dehydration becomes severe enough, the patient may need to be admitted to the hospital to take fluids intravenously. , loss of fluids through vomiting and diarrhea creates the risk of dehydration. it is important to replace lost fluid and electrolytes by drinking water, herbal tea, juice, and broth. even if it doesn't feel good to drink, this is the best way to keep up your body's energy and get past the worst of the symptoms. try eating a popsicle, ice chips or some sorbet as a way to get both water and sugar into your system. drink plenty of water especially after severe bouts of vomiting or diarrhea. children can drink a rehydration solution like pedialyte to restore fluids and electrolytes. , loperamide (imodium a-d) can help to relieve the cramping associated with salmonella-related diarrhea. however, this medication can also prolong the diarrhea itself., eating salty or spicy foods can further aggravate your already-sensitive digestive system. avoid rich fatty foods as well, which your digestive tract may find irritating. , lay it over your abdomen to help relieve any cramps you may be experiencing. a hot water bottle, or a hot bath, will also do the trick.", "you may need to reapply the repellent every few days, especially after the rain. many repellents are non-toxic since they are formulated to drive squirrels away rather than kill them. most deer repellents will also be effective since squirrels and deers are driven off by many of the same scents. look specifically for a repellent with large amounts of \"putrescent whole egg solids.\" this is, essentially, rotten eggs. squirrels typically hate the smell of rotten eggs. be aware that many repellents can have a strong odor, especially immediately after application. the smell tends to dissipate as the spray dries, but in the meantime, you may need to place the pumpkin away from the house.; , the animosity between squirrel and dog is mutual, and many squirrels will stay away from an area if they smell a dog. dog hair is also effective at repelling deer. cat hair may have a similar effect on squirrels, since larger cats can pose a threat to squirrels. it is best to use pet hair rather than pet waste. cat waste is especially dangerous to use since it is a source of toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection that can cause serious health concerns for pregnant women and people with immune deficiencies. , applying a coat of liquefied hot pepper, hot sauce, or powdered cayenne pepper can give the squirrels in your neighborhood a shock once they take a sniff or nibble. blend the hottest peppers you can find with enough water to form a liquid. add a drop of dish soap and a drop of vegetable oil to help the solution stick and pour it into a spray bottle. coat the pumpkin every few days with this solution to drive squirrels away. rub a coat of commercial hot sauce over all sides of the pumpkin. you may need to reapply the sauce after a few days or after the rain, but the hot oils have a way of penetrating the skin and soaking into the flesh of the pumpkin. create a scent barrier around your pumpkin by sprinkling powdered cayenne pepper around it. you can also sprinkle the pepper on top of the pumpkin for added effect. always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling hot peppers. otherwise, you may irritate your skin or eyes. , the potent smell of vinegar can be over-powering to squirrels since these critters have more sensitive noses than humans. vinegar is also effective at repelling ants and other insects. you can also wipe the surface of the pumpkin down with a vinegar-soaked rag, but it is best to avoid letting large amounts of vinegar sit on the pumpkin's surface. the acidic properties of vinegar can end up damaging your pumpkin when used in large quantities. , dab the eucalyptus oil onto the pumpkin's surface with a cotton ball or spray diluted eucalyptus oil onto the pumpkin with a spray bottle. in a spray bottle, combine ten parts water with one part eucalyptus oil. add a drop of cooking oil and a drop of liquid dish soap to help the", "you could have a \"leaving\" party and drop all of your items into the chest. you may also want to stop in lumbridge and help new users by offering them some money to help them on their journey. you can even drop your items allowing them to disappear from the game completely, or disperse your items among your friends. whichever you choose to do, let it be a way that satisfies you and could potentially benefit the community.; , this is an obvious one, cancelling your subscription only allows you to play the free to play version of the runescape. even if you keep logging in to play runescape you will not have as much fun as you would in members and could end up bored of the game more easily. , jagex stores a cache on your computer to allow the masses of information in the game to load much faster. deleting it will not only save you a bit of hard disk space but also make runescape more laggy and unresponsive the first time you log in if you can't resist going back. , do you play for thrill? boredom? whatever it might be there is often a different healthier way to satisfy you. picking up a hobby is a great way to relieve addiction. to play runescape effectively, you should be thinking of it as just a game, not a life necessity. think about how the game affects you. look at how it affects others. , this is quite obvious, but this step can be difficult. try to catch yourself every time before you get to the login screen. , you can do this with the windows hosts file, or you may have parental control software you can use or have your parents set. , that's right. walk up to someone and give your account away. not only have you helped someone else, you are no longer that level 100 you were if you ever try to play again. alternatively, post it online for someone else to use. , this will keep you from logging in permanently. should you ever want to play runescape again, you would need to create a new account. , this can include learning to play an instrument, sports, collecting, or travelling. this will take your mind off the game, and more the time you spend away from it, the more free time to concentrate you will have. , go to the password change screen, then type a random jumble of letters into the address bar. copy and paste this into your \"new password\" box. this way you will know your account is gone forever, and there is no way to get it back. , for example, if you fall in love with mathematics or jogging, you could spend lots of time with it instead of with runescape. there really isn't much point in just walking away from runescape or unplugging the internet: you'll come back because your schedule and life is empty. you have to fill it with something useful, something that will take", "it’s key that the butter has been softened to room temperature first so that it is easy to mix in.you can combine the ingredients by hand, or use a mixing bowl to blend them all together more quickly (and without the elbow grease). continue blending the ingredients together until they are thoroughly blended into a creamy texture. ; , crack and add one egg into the mixture, and stir it thoroughly. then, add your second. once both eggs are blended into the mixture, add a teaspoon (4.93 ml) of vanilla extract. continue mixing. , you can use a fork to mix all of these dry ingredients together easily. once they’re thoroughly blended, add them to the creamy mixture. the easiest way to do this is to add a bit of the dry mixture, mix it all together, add a bit more of the dry mixture, mix it again, and so on. it’s a slow and steady process! , if you want to add a little something extra to your oatmeal cookies – and if your arm isn’t completely exhausted at this point – then add in some delicious mix-ins. common additions are raisins and chocolate chips. you can also add things like cranberries, coconut flakes, chopped nuts, or anything else that sounds good to you.don’t be afraid to get creative. if you want to try several variations, feel free to split up the dough into chunks and try all different mix-ins! , after you’ve created your dough, cover it and pop it in the refrigerator for at least an hour before baking.by chilling the dough, it’ll thicken up a bit before baking and you’ll create really chewy, thick cookies.you’ll have to be patient, but the finished product will be worth it. , once you’re almost ready to take the cookie dough out of the fridge, preheat your oven so it will be hot by the time you’re ready to bake. set your oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit, or 190 degrees celsius.it will probably take your oven anywhere from ten to twenty minutes to get hot enough. , once your cookie dough has chilled for an hour or so, it’s time to form them into balls. you can use your hands to create the balls, or you can use a tablespoon or an ice cream scoop to do this. create rows of the cookie dough balls on baking sheets, leaving about two inches of space between them. if you’d rather have thicker, chewier cookies, leave the dough as is. if you’d prefer thinner, crunchier cookies, flatten out the balls slightly with your fingers or by pressing down on them with a fork coated in sugar.this recipe makes about 24 cookies, although you may make a bit more or less, depending on how big you make the dough balls. , the exact cooking time is a matter of personal preference, but the general range is about eight to ten minutes.if you like chewier, softer cookies, take them out earlier. if you like your cookies crispier, leave them in for the full time. , it’s", "in palmistry, there is the notion of an active hand and a passive hand. your active hand is your dominant hand, whereas the passive hand is the non-dominant hand. the passive hand will indicate inherited traits. this should be read as a baseline. the dominant hand will show any changes from the inherited state from life events etc. if there is a major difference between the lines of the passive hand and the dominant hand, it means that this person has worked hard to develop themselves.; , these are the heart line, the head line, the life line, and the fate line (not everyone has this line).1. the heart line runs horizontally across the top of the palm. it reflects the state of your heart on both the physical and emotional level. 2. the head line runs horizontally across the middle of the palm. it reflects the state of your mind and brain. 3. the life line curves around the base of the thumb, starting between the index finger and thumb. contrary to popular belief, this line does not actually indicate how long you will live but rather aspects such as strength, vitality, and prosperity. 4. the fate line runs vertically from the base of the palm up the middle of the palm (not everybody has this line). it indicates aspects such as success, career path, and vocation. , this line can be read in either direction (from the pinkie finger to the index finger, or vice versa), depending on the tradition being followed. it is believed to indicate emotional stability, romantic perspectives, depression, and cardiac health. how to read the line and its specific meanings are as follows:if the heart line starts below the index finger it means that you are picky when it comes to love. a heart line that begins below the middle finger indicates a person who is selfish when it comes to love. if it begins in the middle of the palm, the person falls in love easily. an absent heart line indicates an individual who is ruled by logic rather than emotion. a faint line shows a person who is aloof and places little importance on emotions. a straight and short heart line indicates an individual who is not particularly concerned with romance. a long and curvy heart line indicates someone who expresses emotions freely. a wavy line indicates many relationships and/or lovers, with an absence of serious relationships. if the heart line is straight and parallel to the head line, it indicates that the individual has a good handle on their emotions. a heart line that touches the life line means that the heart is broken easily. a broken heart line or a heart line with smaller lines crossing it can indicate emotional trauma. a chained line can mean depression. , this represents learning style, communication style, intellectualism, and thirst for knowledge. the specific meanings are as follows:a head absent line indicates a person who is sluggish. a faint line indicates that the individual lacks memory and concentration and is prone to daydreaming. a deep", "keep in mind the age of the children when planning the time. you should also keep in mind the parents when planning the party, especially if the party is for very young children. consider things like work for the parents and school for the children. late morning or early afternoon on a saturday could be a good time. if possible, ask the parents of the children you’re inviting what would be a good time for them.if the party is for very young children, consider common nap times. parties at night would probably not be the ideal time for children. , a tea party for children is the most fun if a theme is involved. if the party is for mostly girls, you could choose a princess theme. an alice in wonderland theme is another cute and classic option. you could also choose a theme based on a country, which would be educational and fun. a british theme or chinese are a couple of options. research the decorations, costumes, food, and music based on the theme of your choosing. , send out invitations based on the theme. you can have invitations printed, or you can send them out via email. you should send the invitations out at least two weeks before the date of the party, though a month before is ideal. if you don’t want to send out custom-made invitations, you can simply email or call the parents of the children.you can find websites that have downloadable invitation templates. some are free, but others cost money. , don’t worry about buying very costly supplies if you will be hosting a room full of children. small, plastic tea cups and plates will work fine. again, consider the theme when choosing the tea pot, cups, and plates. you can buy colored or design plates based on the theme. you will also need to buy plastic utensils, a tablecloth, serving trays, and napkins.you can buy tea sets made for children. many of them, however, are expensive and easily breakable. you can purchase supplies at party stores, like party city. you can also purchase supplies online. just make sure you purchase the items in enough time for them to be delivered by the date of the party. , children may not drink hot tea, so consider some other kid-friendly options. sweet tea, apple juice, and other fruit juices are some alternative options. you can still serve the drinks in the tea pot, even if you aren’t serving hot tea. consider if parents will be staying when planning the food and tea. if some parents will be staying, buy hot tea, cold tea, and wine. , buy food the day before or a few days before the party, depending on the type of food you will be buying. children may not eat the same things you would serve at an adult tea party, so choose some basic foods. for food, simple cheese, or turkey and cheese sandwiches, muffins, and assorted tea triangle sandwiches with simple ingredients work well. for dessert, sugar cookies, brownies, cupcakes, and fresh fruits", "once you bring a cat home and name it, you should get it some identification. this can be in the form of a tag on its collar, but you can also get it microchipped at its veterinary office. even if you plan on raising the cat to live indoors, having identification is important -- remember, if it gets out, it will have no experience finding its way home.your cat's collar tag should include its name and your phone number. keep this phone number up to date, so that someone who finds your cat can contact you easily. , when raising a cat, you will need to teach it to use a litter box. for most cats, this is a relatively easy process. once you bring a cat home, keep it contained in a small space with food, water, a bed, and its litter box. the cat may naturally head towards the litter box to go to the bathroom, as they are naturally clean animals that like to pick specific bathroom areas.as your cat adjusts to its new home and you let it roam the whole house, you should keep the litter box in an area that is easily accessible and close to your cat's daily activity. this will help ensure that the cat actually uses it instead of a handy corner. , if the cat doesn't use the litter box automatically, move any feces or urine into the litter box and clean the areas where the cat went to the bathroom outside of the box. if the cat smells feces and urine in the litter box, it will know that is where it should go. , to ensure that your cat uses its litter box, you should make sure to keep it clean and tidy. remember to remove solids daily. you should also empty it completely, clean the box, and put totally new litter in weekly.if you do not clean your cat's litter box regularly, it is likely to find somewhere else to go to the bathroom. , when raising a cat you should make sure to give it a cozy place all its own, where it can take a nap or just get some alone time. typically, this is done by giving it a bed all its own and placing that bed in a quiet and warm corner. this can be difficult to achieve if you live in a hectic or crowded home, but your cat may even pick the spot itself and all you have to do is provide the cushioning. many cats love a spot that gets sun from the outside. the sunshine and the view to the outside will likely be very appealing to your cat. even on a day that is cold outside or when your home is a little chilly, a sunny spot will suit a cat's needs very well., all cats need to scratch once in awhile in order to keep their claws healthy and agile. in order to allow them to do this without destroying your furniture, you should get them a scratching post", "shortcuts may be faster, but they can also be more complicated! if the person is lost or has poor navigation skills to begin with, give them directions with minimal turns. for example: make a left on baker street, then a right at the light, and go straight all the way down that road until you get to the highway.; , how far along a particular road does the person need to go? there are several different ways to tell them: how many blocks or streets they'll pass. this works better in a city than in the country, because in the city there are more cross-streets to count, whereas in the country the space between them makes it easier to lose count, and some driveways look like roads of their own. for example: \"continue down that street, passing 4 side roads along the way.\" how many traffic lights they'll pass. this is good, but you must be right about the number! for example: \"you are going to pass three traffic lights before the turn.\" distance in miles or kilometers. for example: \"go 3 miles (5 kilometers) on holypoke road\" how much time it'll take. this is better for when they'll be spending a short time on that path; any longer than that, and your directions will become inaccurate depending on how fast the person drives. for example: \"it should be about five minutes on the highway.\" give them a drop dead point. a drop dead point is a landmark that tells them that they've gone too far and have missed their turn. for example: \"if you see the library, you have gone too far.\" , if it's not a simple, four-way intersection, give a few extra details. otherwise, tell them to make a left or right. give them a street name and one landmark (a traffic light, a particular store). if the person you're giving directions to is good with cardinal directions (north, south, west, east) and/or the city you're in is laid out like a grid (with all the streets perpendicular, running east-west or north-south) indicate the direction, too. for example: \"turn a left at the traffic light onto foster, heading east.\" , for example: \"turn left onto baker street\" instead of \"at baker street, turn left.\" , for example: \"my house is on the left.\" , for instance, if a lane ends or is right turn only, or a road they need to turn onto is small or hidden, you might want to mention that. if there's a turn that you know people tend to miss, tell them how they'll know they've gone too far. for example: \"the lane is going to merge before the turn, and baker street will become forest street. but you will want to keep traveling down it once it becomes forest street.\" , remember to be concise. detailed directions are useless if you give so many details that the person driving gets confused. for example: \"make a left on baker street, then a right at the second light, and go straight all the way down that", "your spine should be in alignment (i.e.: with your slight natural curve, as if you were standing straight up). keeping your hips back and chest up prevents a rounded spine. most people start to get lazy as they get tired, and their back starts to curve. this is dangerous and ineffective. no matter how tired you are, you must focus on your spinal alignment. a rounded spine can lead to very serious injury. if you can't do a rep right, don't do it at all -- bad form is much worse than none at all. , you should be able to lift and wiggle your toes if you wanted. resting on your toes puts stress on your knees, whereas you have a much more solid base on your heels. , do not let your knees pull or \"cave in\" while squatting. this is bad for your knees. actively push your knees toward proper position throughout the entire squat to ensure against bad alignment. you need to keep your knees mostly quiet, bending but otherwise leaving them in roughly the same place throughout the exercise. if you feel extra muscle exertion through your glutes (hips), you are doing it right. focus on keeping your knees outward, pushing through the heel, not the toes. never let your knees extend beyond your toes, as this will increase the likelihood of damage to the patellar tendon and ligament in the knee. your knees might move slightly forward as you squat, but this is okay -- just keep them over your foot, behind the toes. , you want the bar to rest on your traps, (upper back muscles). you'll know if it's on your neck if you can feel the bar digging into your neck-bone, as one of your hard vertebrae will be right in the way. lower the bar a bit and distribute/balance the weight evenly across your upper body. a slightly wider grip may help. , this most effectively utilizes your body's natural rhythm, allowing you to access the most air and move through the squat fluidly. in general, inhale as you \"enter\" an exercise, like a stretch. then exhale as you exert action. , as with any athletic endeavor, warming up and stretching is necessary to prevent strain or injury. warm up first by getting your heart rate up and then following the directions below for a warm up squat, but with a very small amount of weight. static versus dynamic stretch: static stretching is a type of stretch where you hold a position for a certain amount of time (usually 15-30 seconds). dynamic (active) stretching involves controlled movements through various ranges of motion. dynamic stretching is sometimes recommended because warming up by moving may offer less risk of injury. shoulder rolls, light kicks, sumo squats, leg circles, and knee bends are all good examples of dynamic stretching exercises. start with no weights at all—or an unloaded barbell, if you're new to squats and weight training. if you're more experienced, or you find an unloaded barbell too light, select weights that are appropriate for", "approach your friends, family, and acquaintances about issues you’re passionate about. your goal should be to make them care about that issue. think about their experiences, sympathies, and temperaments so you can craft an appeal that’s most likely to succeed.for example, imagine your uncle is a police officer in a poor area. the issue you care about is education. if you want to get him to care about education in the same way you do, talk to him about how lack of educational opportunities contributes to crime. you could open by saying something like this: “you know they just cut funding for afterschool programs in sandtown? better get ready to start chasing kids all over the city. kids with nothing to do get in trouble.” it’s easier to influence someone’s opinion about a new subject than it is to change their mind about something. talk with them about unfamiliar subjects or approach new subjects in unfamiliar ways. , social media platforms like twitter, instagram, and facebook can be a great way to raise awareness of an issue. these tools allow you to reach large audiences with relatively little effort, and numerous issues have gone viral (achieved notoriety quickly) with the aid of social media.use social media to promote articles, videos, and memes that tackle any one of the many facets of ending poverty. while the reach of social media is broad, its effect is often shallow. even though it’s a great way to spread a message, social media alone usually doesn’t produce lasting change. over-reliance on social media risks creating a lot of “slacktivists,” or people who are constantly hitting the “share” button to spread a message, but take no action beyond that., if you want to take your advocacy one step further, create content that tackles issues relating to poverty. “content creation” is a broad term, but all it really means is creating any type of media—whether it’s audio, video, visual, or written. in order to publish your content, you can create your own platform or contribute to someone else’s, depending on the effort you can devote to it.podcasts, blogs, and youtube are all great ways to publish your message. you can create your own blog, podcast, or youtube channel if you think you can attract an audience and you want complete control over messaging. see start your own podcast and start a blog to learn more. there are a lot of ways to publish your content on someone else’s site but they’re all going to boil down to two basic methods:you can give them what they want, or convince them to accept what you’re offering. search the blogs, podcasts, and youtube channels that you think would make a good platform for your message, and ask them their policies on submissions. either they’ll ask you to create something about a certain subject, or they’ll want you to pitch them on something you’re working on. , many voices together are more powerful than one voice alone. by joining a group that’s concerned with the same issues you’re concerned with, you’ll gain credibility", "this will have an impact on whom you interview, how you will conduct the interview, and how you will write the subsequent essay.if your essay is to be a factual piece, you'll want to interview someone who has expertise in the subject matter you'll be addressing. if your paper is about a science topic, you'll want to interview a scientist in that field. if your paper is about a period of history, you'll want to interview either a historian or someone who's lived through that period of history. if you plan to make your essay an opinion piece, you'll likely want to interview someone who has a strong opinion about the topic covered in your essay. ideally, you want someone who can express opinions articulately, and who also has credentials in the area you plan to write about. if your piece will have a narrow perspective, you'll need to interview only one or two people. if your piece will present a general consensus, you'll need to interview more people, probably with varying expertise and credentials.; , in order to conduct an effective interview that can in turn become a successful interview essay, you need to delve into the history and background of your subject(s) and the topic at the core of your essay. you can use this information to determine the best questions to ask in the interview.when available, read works about and works written by your subject, both in print and online. at the same time, research the topic associated with your subject. the more you know about both, the more intelligent questions you can ask. look for previous interviews your subject has given, as well. these will give you an idea of what questions the person has been asked before, so you can decide on appropriate subjects for your own questions, including questions that no one else has asked. questions that require \"yes\" or \"no\" answers are good for gathering specific factual information; open-ended \"how,\" \"why,\" and \"tell me about\" questions are great for gathering additional background material not found in your research. draw up a list of the questions you are prepared to ask. have more questions ready than you will likely use, so that you can make adjustments as the interview takes place. (for instance, your subject may begin focusing on what you thought was a side topic, but turns out to be the key part of your interview.) rank your questions in order of importance to make sure you ask your best ones, or list them all in the order you'd ask them and color-code the most important ones. , you'll need to contact the interviewee (or his or her representative) to arrange a time and place to conduct the interview. you'll also need permission to record the interview with either audio or video equipment, or to take photographs. be sure the person you contact knows who you are and why you want to interview him or her.choose a quiet place with few distractions for your interview site. a library, restaurant, or campus location if you're doing", "try to set aside at least 25% of your monthly income for savings. you should have at least six months’ worth of income saved to cover periods of potential unemployment. be sure to set beneficiaries on your retirement and insurance plans, too. if you separate from your partner, don’t forget to change your beneficiary list. , are you still both increasing your savings? do you have enough saved to cover an emergency? are you both still comfortable with the way expenses are being shared? talk to your partner about these and other related issues. make budgeting and financial planning an activity you do together. this can be more successful or even exciting if you are both working towards a common goal, such as a vacation or purchasing a home. always be honest about your finances. if you are struggling financially, you should admit to your partner that you’re having money problems. that way they can help you out by either loaning you money, helping you find another job, or taking other action that can help. encourage your partner to be honest with you about their spending habits and their happiness with your current financial arrangement. if your partner lies about money matters, you should seriously consider ending the relationship. don’t let your partner push you into a purchase you can’t really afford.for instance, if you can’t afford a new car but your partner really wants you to have one, stand firm and insist that you will not make such a purchase. if they love you, they will respect your decision. , only move in together if you’re truly in love with the person and ready to be in close proximity to them night and day. this will make splitting finances just one part of your relationship, and not its entire basis. , it’s okay to borrow money in an emergency situation, but don’t make a regular habit of it. if your partner regularly asks to borrow money, you should inquire as to why they constantly need money. they may have lost their job or have unpaid debts you don’t know about. , the last thing you want to do is end up saddled with debt that you did not personally incur. only make a large investment with your partner like a house or car if you are in a stable, long-term relationship.you should ask your partner about any debts or liabilities that they may hold. be honest about your own debt as well. keeping these secret can ruin a relationship when the debt is discovered by the other partner. always put both your names on the lease, mortgage, or loan. this will allow you some degree of protection in the event you and your partner separate. for mortgages, consult a real-estate attorney to help you figure out the best way to negotiate your local real estate laws as they relate to your relationship. a married couple has different options for taking out a home loan than an unmarried couple. for auto loans, too, you (and your partner) should talk to a financial", "photorec is a free data recovery program that runs from a command line interface. it is not as flashy or intuitive as other recovery programs, but it is one of the most powerful free data recovery solutions, and works on virtually all operating systems. photorec can be downloaded from the cgsecurity website. ensure that you are downloading the correct version for your operating system.; , photrec is a lightweight program, and does not need to be installed. instead, open the zip file after it is downloaded and copy the folder to an easy-to-access location on your hard drive, such as the root of c: drive or your desktop. , double-click on the \"photorec_os\" file in the testdisk folder. the os part of the name will be replaced with whatever version you downloaded. for example, if you are using windows, the file will be called \"photorec_win\". , ensure that the sd card has been inserted into your computer's card reader, or that it is inserted in the camera and the camera is connected to the computer via usb. when photorec starts, you will be given the option to choose which disk you want to recover data on. use the arrow keys to select your sd card. if you have multiple partitions on the disk, you will be asked to select which partition you want. most memory cards aren't partitioned, so you won't need to choose. , you are given a few options before the recovery process starts. most users can leave these at their defaults, but if you want to recover files even if they are corrupted, you can enable that on this screen. enabling \"brute force\" will recover fragmented files, and is very cpu intensive. , by default, all of the file types are highlighted. if you know exactly what files you are looking for, you can narrow it down to speed up the search. each extension in the list has a brief definition next to it to help you determine what kind of file it is. if you are recovering for a camera, you will want to focus on raw and cr2 files, as well as jpg , photorec will need to know what file system type the memory card has. most memory cards are formatted in one of the systems in the \"other\" category. if you aren't able to get any results, try running the scan again with the other file system option. , photorec will give you two options for space checking: free or whole. if your memory card is corrupt, you will get better results with the whole option. the free option will only look for files that have been specifically deleted. , the last thing you need to do before you start scanning for files is set a location for recovered files to be saved. you will need to select a location on your computer and not on the memory card you are trying to recover from. use your arrow keys to change directories. , you can see the scan results update as the scan is performed.", "it can be a good idea to get a blood test to see what levels of b12 you have before trying supplements. depending on the results, you may need shots, tablets or capsules, or fortified foods to change your levels, or you may be just fine but need to keep an eye on your future health and b12 levels to ensure that they don't fall. talk to your doctor about possible options but recognise that unless your doctor is sympathetic to your choice of diet, you may be given information that doesn't suit your dietary choices or that even suggests you are not healthy. if that's the case, look for a new doctor who will take your veganism into account objectively and work with you, not against you.; , vitamin b12 is considered to require a higher dosage for older persons than for younger persons: 2 micrograms a day for young people 25 micrograms or more per day for people over 50.the vegan society makes a general recommendation of 10mg per day with a once-weekly b12 supplement perhaps of 2000mg but fails to provide an indication of age appropriateness. , you will read a lot of opinions promising you that it isn't possible to get \"proper\" b12 from plant food sources and that you're doomed to dementia, anemia, or something worse.that kind of dramatic conclusion can either lead to you rebelling and not bothering to do anything at all, or worrying too much that your balanced, healthy diet is not good for you. when you know already that it is. the reality is that b12 is in many fortified foods that you can consume and it's actually a very rare deficiency. the amounts of vitamin b12 thought to be needed for good health would be hard to get from food alone, and it is thought that it is better absorbed from supplements anyway.just be sure to find dairy and animal-derivative free supplements from a reputable supplier. don't be complacent, however. being reassured is about knowing that if you actively care for your body's nutrient needs, then it will be a lot better than neglecting them. vitamin b12 is important for your brain, nervous system, and red blood cells. and the risk for deficiency increases as you age., there is a range of food available, although it varies from country to country. always read the ingredients and if you're not sure, contact the supplier or the manufacturer for concise nutritional information. some items that may be fortified with b12 include: soy milks, and other non-dairy milks energy bars like clif and luna cereals brewer's yeast and nutritional yeasts but only if fortifiedyeast spreads, such as marmite. if you don't like the taste, you can just put a small spoonful in sauces or other foods to hide the taste. yeast flakes are the same but a little harder to find (they add a great, nutty, maybe even cheesy, taste to any food) but well worth the investment - a box will last you ages. note that vegemite does not contain b12. vegan food products", "what qualities, values and experiences are you offering your customers? in order for your branding to seem authentic and be effective, you need to project a truthful image of what your company strives to provide. but before you can do that, it’s important to articulate your company’s mission so that you’re clear on what sets you apart from the pack. think about the following questions: why did you start this business? what goals do you want to achieve? who are the people you want to help? what makes your company different from others in your field?; , aim for your customers to think of your brand almost like a living, breathing person they can trust. they need to know that your product or service is the one they should turn to when faced with a dozen choices in the grocery aisle or a long list of names in the phone book. taking your mission into account, decide what type of attitude you want to project. what spin are you going to put on your mission? maybe you want your product to be seen as the ticket to an adventure or a brand new life or a second chance at youth. this approach is often taken by upscale food companies that sell products like goji berry juice or sprouted grain granola bars. maybe you want to present your brand as smart and cutting edge. being seen with your product will make customers feel cool, like they’re in a special club. brands like urban outfitters and apple take this approach. another approach would be offering your customers a reliable, completely trustworthy option that will never let them down. this is a good approach if you’re selling a product that should never malfunction, like tires, or if you’re building a brand for your law practice. you could also rely on nostalgia to build your brand. people feel connected to things that remind them of childhood and carefree times. , when you buy a product, why do you buy it? what makes you choose a particular brand? see if you can use your answer to help you figure out how your own brand will come across. find out what your customers are longing to feel and make your brand help them feel that way. do they want to feel powerful? responsible? conscientious? smart? unique? your brand needs to evoke this feeling with all of its copy, marketing, and design. cue these feelings not only with language, but with colors and product design as well. , choose a catchphrase or slogan and some key words that you want to be associated with your brand. the words should be closely aligned with your mission statement, and memorable enough for people to repeat to each other and recognize next time they read them. use your brand language not only in the copy of your products and advertising, but also when you discuss your business and make contacts in person. keep your text as streamlined and basic as you can, because it will be more memorable that way. a good", "don't open any covers of the a/c, cooling and heating portions without turning off the power first.; , each has fans, electrical relays and various connections. both might be in the same unit as in a window unit.the evaporator is inside the building to intake air and exchange the heat in that air to the cooled evaporator coils -- and they in turn cooling the air to be recirculated into the conditioned air space. this part called the \"cooling unit\" can seen inside the building (indoors part of a window a/c unit, for example). the condenser is outside to disperse collected heat into the exterior air. that is the \"radiator\" like coils that are on the outdoors (back, of a window unit, for example). this may be a standalone box-like fixture with the compressor, louvers and grill like vents -- and its job is sending chilled water or compressed refrigerant (such as freon) to the evaporator through tubing or pipes (some systems use highly toxic ammonia as refrigerant, instead of safer freon). , it is usually located in a convenient place, easily accessed (in a wall, mechanical room door or a ceiling for example). this maintenance is crucial, because when the filter is clogged the system becomes inefficient. if a system were ever operated with a torn, ill-fitted or missing filter -- the evaporator could become clogged with dust and fungi, and ducting could become dirty and all require extensive cleaning. , the thermostat is the control inside the house that allows you to make a setting for ambient temperature (air temp) and select the air flow option inside your home. if this is broken, controlling the air temperature becomes impossible. this may mean that your air conditioner stops running entirely, it runs continually, or it works in rough starts and stops. either way, it can end up costing you a lot of money, which is why it gets fixed so often. , refrigerant is a compressed gas that cools down the air by being pump through your a/c condenser and evaporator. there is supposed to be a certain amount of refrigerant inside your air conditioner at all times. when it gets low, your air does not get cooled down quite as much as it should. , there is usually a pipe connected to your air conditioning evaporator unit that drains all of the condensation water that builds up while it is running. if the pipe is not draining correctly, water can leak on your floor, in attic space/ceiling, basement or on your roof. this can cause a lot more problems if not detected quickly and repaired (window a/c units usually drip outside, directly below the widow unit). , the fan motor is what draws in the fresh or recirculating air through the cooling coils to cool down the air. if this is not working correctly, then your home will not be near as cool as it could be. , if your air conditioner is making more noise than usual, it may be because your air compressor is becoming worn out. this", "even though it feels bad to dwell on mistakes we’ve made, many people replay those things over and over again in their heads. allow yourself forgiveness, and see what you can learn from your mistakes.you can’t change the past, but you can learn valuable lessons from it. tell yourself how great it is that you’ve learned something new and can change the way you do things in the future. if you remember certain times that you acted in an attention-seeking way in the past, forgive yourself for those things, too. the fact that you can acknowledge those behaviors means you can work to prevent them in the future. talk to yourself kindly, the way that you would to a friend having a difficult time. say to yourself, \"i know i messed up that time, but i was doing my best in the moment. everyone messes up sometimes. it's okay, and i'll try to do things differently next time.\" , choose ways that you want to practice being authentic each day. this can mean doing something that you enjoy by yourself, or reciting an important affirmation to yourself.practice being yourself and acting in a way that feels genuine, without worrying what people will think. you can make a practice of doing one thing each day, when you feel that you’re being true to how you feel in the moment. this could mean saying something honest that you haven't before, such as, \"actually, i don't like going to that cafe very much.\" it can also mean doing something differently, such as wearing an outfit that's comfortable, even if it's not stylish. you can develop personal affirmations to help you accept yourself. you can say something like, “i am a valuable, lovable person the way that i am,” or, “i accept and love all aspects of myself even as i work to grow and change.” , mindfulness refers to trying to stay present wherever you are, without getting lost in thoughts or feelings that take you out of the moment. mindfulness is most often practiced through meditation techniques. however, there are many ways to practice mindfulness.you can find books or websites that offer meditation techniques, or visit a meditation center to find guidance on how to begin meditating. if meditating isn’t right for you, practice mindfulness by noticing the physical sensations you’re experiencing. if you start to get distracted by guilt, shame, or unpleasant memories, just notice the feeling of your clothes on your skin, or your feet on the ground. , it is almost impossible to make a change in ourselves if we don’t consciously commit to doing so. if you want to change or eliminate your attention-seeking behavior, make a commitment to do so, and to take specific steps toward that goal.write down your commitment. you can put it on a calendar, marking the day you commit to start working on it. write down daily or weekly goals, such as, “i will meditate for five minutes each day,” or, “each week, i will volunteer 5 hours of my time to a charitable cause.”", "kids don’t have very long attention spans, so try to choose a book that will be interesting to them and likewise to you. children are keenly aware when the adult around them is not interested in what they’re doing. try a pop-up book if you’re unsure how to pick something fun. if you find that the kids are not paying attention, or you just want to avoid losing their interest, try selecting a few books, two or three should suffice, and have the kids vote on which one they want to read. you can’t please everyone, but you can work the runner-up story into the next storytime.; , the book you choose should be appropriate for the age group and appropriate with regard to content. if you’ve been tasked to read to older children, books like everybody poops may not be the best selection. instead, try something in the dr. seuss line, or the classic incognito mosquito. , regardless of the age group, make sure you read the book yourself a few times. you can think about possible questions the kids might have, think of fun ways to read through the book, and also find a natural rhythm or cadence that fits the pace and tone of the book. , pick different stories for each reading. if you read the same story again and again the kids are likely to get bored. what’s more, reading a variety of stories will expose the children to a breadth of vocabulary, plots, and diversity, specifically in the types of language. in other words, your little ones will have ongoing experiences with different syntactic forms (sentence and phrase structure), sounds, verb tenses, and emotions., you’ll lose part of the audience if they can’t hear you. also, they won’t be able to pay attention if they don’t know what’s going on. please remember that there is a difference between talking for all to hear and yelling a story at the kids. avoid the latter by testing the room’s acoustics beforehand. you can do this by reading to another adult or even by turning on the voice recorder on your phone and placing it in the middle of the room. , kids need structure and learn this through interaction. before you start reading the story, be sure to reinforce a few simple rules like, “don’t interrupt the story” and “raise your hand if you have a question.” as you read through the story, you’ll likely need to restate these simple rules several times, but do it calmly and politely. if you happen to be interrupted, you can try to a polite phrase like “i see your hand, please wait your turn” or “i’ll call on you when it’s time for questions.” , whether it’s a book about a caterpillar or the three little pigs, there is always room for fun. as you preview the book, come up with some different ways to read each character’s lines, using vocal expression. you might change the pitch of your voice from low to high, speed it up or slow it down,", "before you jump right into researching mfa creative writing programs, you should consider your goals as a writer and what you expect to get out of an mfa. mfa programs are a good way to spend two to three years focusing solely on creative work and give you the space to grow as a writer. you will be surrounded by other writers and get a chance to connect to a larger writing community. you may also find mentors in your professors and faculty members who are writers themselves, allowing you to feel supported by their guidance and knowledge.keep in mind you do not need an mfa to be a successful writer, as some publishers are not partial to writers with an mfa. you are not guaranteed a book deal at the end of an mfa program. if you view an mfa as your only shot at being a legitimate writer, you may want to reconsider your expectations for the degree.many successful writers do not have mfas but some do and the value of the degree will often be more personal than professional. though your chances of landing a teaching position in a writing program may increase if you have an mfa, you will still need to work hard to have a career in teaching creative writing. having an mfa is a benefit to landing a teaching position, but it is not a guarantee.; , though you may end up applying to only mfa programs that offer full funding or partial funding, you will still need to pay for the cost of living, books, and school fees. if you do not get into a funded program, you may end up footing most of the bill for tuition, which can be in the thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars. you should be prepared to take out loans to pay for the mfa or have a large amount of money saved up for tuition.you should look over your finances, paying close attention to any savings or investments you may have. you should be prepared to take out loans to pay for tuition in the event you do not get funding and do not have enough saved to afford school. , ask yourself, do i need an mfa to fulfill my goals as a writer? will the mfa offer me something i cannot find or create on my own? considering your current resources as a writer and how an mfa to add or improve upon them is an important step in the process. you want to be sure that the mfa will help you fulfill your goals as a writer and feel worth your time and money.perhaps you are already a member of a local writing group, but you feel an mfa will help you take your writing to a higher level. or maybe you have published a few short stories and are working on several different writing projects, but think that an mfa will improve your craft and give you the time to work on these projects. consider how the mfa will provide", "before you can do any planning, you need to determine what your goals are. do you want to maintain your weight, but maybe make healthier choices? do you want to lose or gain weight? take the number of calories you currently consume per day as a starting point and work to determine the number of calories you will need to consume in the future to meet your goals. remember that it takes a reduction of 500 calories per day (on average) to lose one pound per week.for most people, this reduction can come from carbohydrates. remember not to cut down any macro-nutrient group too low. avoid cutting back too far on protein and healthy fat as both as used from repair and hormone production. example: say your current caloric intake was calculated to be 2,000 per day. you want to lose some weight, so you decide you need to cut back to 1,500 calories per day to do that safely. in order to maintain a healthy diet, 40-60% of those calories need to come from carbs. to make things easy, let’s assume you want to have 50% of your calories come from carbs. multiply your daily calorie goal of 1,500 by 50% to get 750 calories per day from carbs. now divide the 750 calories per day by 4 (as there are 4 calories in every carb) to get 187.5 grams of carbs per day. you now have your daily caloric and carb intake amounts., using your calculated number of calories and carbs per day, start making yourself a meal plan. use nutritional labels on food packages and the usda’s super tracker (https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/default.aspx) to help you determine the number of calories and carbs in each item you include in your plan. the super tracker is also a great online tool to make a plan, as a ton of nutritional information is already included.the super tracker will also remind you that daily exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. , you should try to eat something with at least 5 grams of fibre at breakfast, to start your day. half of the grains you eat every day should be whole grains. eat breads that have at least 2 grams of fibre per serving (a bread serving is normally 1 slice). substitute whole gran flour for white flour when baking. add fresh or frozen vegetables to foods like soups and sauces. add beans, peas or lentils to your soup or salad.add unprocessed wheat bran to cereals to increase the amount of fibre. try brown rice, wild rice, barley, whole wheat pasta, and bulgur as opposed to the “white” versions. when substituting whole wheat flour for white flour when baking bread, you may need to add more yeast or allow the dough to rise for a longer period of time. if baking powder is part of the recipe, increase it by 1 teaspoon for every 3 cups of whole grain flour. apples, bananas, oranges, pears and berries are great sources of fibre and can easily be eaten as a snack. nuts and dried", "hair loss (known as alopecia) can be based on genetic factors (male-pattern baldness and female-pattern baldness). these are both known as androgenic alopecia because both are dependent on levels of the hormone androgen, which is responsible for hair on the scalp, face, chest, underarms, and genital regions.in men, the hair loss occurs at the front of hairline and on the top of the head (the “bald spot”). in women, hair is thinned all over the scalp, but more at the top of the head. women usually don’t get bald spots.androgenic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss. though far less common, congenital hypotrichosis is a group of genetic conditions with little or no hair growth. these may be due to single or multiple gene defects.; , environmental causes can lead to what’s known as telogen effluvium (te), which is the second leading cause of hair loss. the telogen phase is the resting phase of hair growth. if, for any reason, the number of hair follicles in the active, growth phase drops, te can result, and a person would notice more shedding, usually by noting more hair than usual in a comb or brush. you might also notice more hair loss during bathing or on a bath towel. te can develop in three ways: an environmental “insult” stuns or shocks the hair follicles, and they stop growing. this type of te is usually temporary as long as the triggering event is temporary, and normal hair growth returns within 6-12 months. if the environmental “insult” is more persistent, more and more hair follicles enter the resting state, and there will be a slow, but constant loss of hair. a third type of te may or may not be due to an environmental stressor. in this type, the hair follicles go through shorter hair-growth cycles. the result is thin scalp hair and shedding short hairs, which are very thin. the environmental stressors can be many. some short-term stressors include postpartum alopecia (after giving birth), physical trauma (an accident, a fall, or a broken leg, for instance), vaccinations, crash dieting, or medications, especially antidepressants. more persistent environmental stressors that may lead to more persistent te include nutritional deficiencies (iron, zinc, b-vitamins, lysine) and chronic stress. , anagen effluvium is a rapid form of hair loss due to an interruption in the anagen (or growth phase) of your hair. the most common causes are cancer chemotherapy and poisonings (such as heavy metal poisoning). once chemotherapy ends, or when the poisoning has been treated, hair growth returns, though not always as before. some people experience a change in hair color or type—changing to curly from straight or vice versa. , alopecia areata (aa) is believed to be an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the hair follicles. hair loss can be sudden and most often happens on the scalp in patches. if the entire scalp is affected, it is called alopecia totalis. if the entire body is affected, it is called alopecia universalis. if it is limited to the beard area in men, it is", "; , points to keep in mind when sizing the mat are: 1) install the mat up to the area where the vanity cabinet or pedestal sink will sit, but not under it; that can cause excessive heat buildup; 2) keep the mat 4 in. away from walls, showers and tubs; 3) keep the mat at least 4 in. away from the toilet wax ring; 4) keep the heating cable at least 2 in. away from itself. never overlap the cable; 5) don’t leave large gaps between the mats. your feet will be able to tell!; 6) if your mat is undersized, give priority to the areas where you’ll be standing barefoot most often. ,, up in the wall near where the wiring leads from the mat will terminate. run new wiring to the box from the circuit breaker panel or - if the mat is small - from a nearby outlet (consult manufacturer's instructions for more information about wiring requirements). , notch the bottom plate to accommodate the two conduits that will contain the power lead and the wires for the thermostat-sensing bulb. , select tile that’s at least 6 in. square so each tile will span two or more sections of cable. smaller tiles are more likely to conform to the minor hills and valleys of the cable when you tamp them in place, creating a wavy surface. , use hot-melt glue to additionally secure the mat. don’t leave any humps or loose edges; you’ll snag them with your notched trowel when you’re applying the thin-set mortar. ,, electrical metal tubing (emt) that are long enough to run from the floor to the electrical box for the thermostat. fish the power lead cable through one length of conduit. hot-melt glue the power lead into the groove. fish the thermostat wires through a second piece of conduit, then weave it 12 in. into the mat, keeping it equidistant from the cable on each side. nail metal protective plates over the notches in the bottom plate to protect the wires and cable where they pass through. , use the flat side of the trowel to press the mortar firmly through the mat and into contact with the cement board. you can establish a flat, uniform layer by lightly floating the trowel across the tops of the cable, then use the notched side to comb the mortar to create ridges; a 3/8 x 1/4-in. trowel works well for most tiles. again, lightly skim your trowel over the cable. the sheathing on the cable is tough, but you still need to avoid any “sawing” type action or jabs with the trowel. it takes a little trial and error to get a flat layer. , do two resistance tests while installing the tile to ensure you haven’t damaged the cable. (if the resistance test fails, see the manufacturer’s instructions to find the problem.) once the mortar has dried, grout the joints. , use a programmable thermostat so the mat will only come on when it's needed. it costs more initially but will save energy and"]
